To start we took all of the people who follow @Dreamforce on Twitter and segmented them into distinct niche communities based on their interests and affinities. Our segmentation algorithm found 17 distinct high affinity communities inside the audience of 39.5K people. (Note: Affinio's award winning tech only takes ~30 minutes to analyze the +1B social connections required to create the following report!)

,5,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,5,http://www.affinio.com/blog/understanding-you-customers-affinities-across-social-platforms,Understanding your customer's affinities across social platforms,There are hundreds of social networks that each provide a unique way for people to follow find and connect with the people and things that matter most to them. Each of these networks lends it self to a slightly different type of user content and discourse. These differences allow each network to find a niche and cater to it by offering a new way to create share and consume information. While this wide selection of networks is great for users the choices and selection can be overwhelming for marketers and researchers who are trying to learn about the similarities and differences across networks. It can be easy to assume that the interests and affinities of people stay the same across multiple platforms but the reality is the same person can use multiple networks in different ways for different things and as a result the interest profiles of key audience segments can shift from platform to platform. The challenge with this is understanding who these people are on each network and then identifying the types of content and ads that will resonate with them on any given network. The planning of content (both paid and owned) should be informed by a deep understanding of the target audience for each platform so that your content best resonates with the interests and does not disrupt the user (i.e. give me content I want and expect on the specific platforms). Understanding these subtle differences platform to platform can only come by mapping the same individuals across multiple platforms to see the differences in the following patterns and what they care about most. To better understand how the interests of the same people can vary between networks we ran a couple experiments. We started by analyzing the audience of Neiman Marcus and found a high-affinity tribe of people who were interested in designer fashion. Using this tribe as a seed we created a list of 25000 people on Twitter who matched this affinity profile and found their corresponding accounts on Instagram using Affinio’s ability to map accounts across multiple platforms. We then ran a report on the same 25000 people on Instagram and compared the content topics and top affinity accounts of these people. Of the top 200 high affinity accounts for fashionista’s on Twitter 123 of them matched with the top 200 affinity accounts on Instagram. The remaining 77 accounts were unique between networks highlighting that although these 25000 people are interested in fashion on both social networks there are distinct differences in the accounts and topics that matter most when switching between networks. This means that 61.5% of these accounts have high-affinity to these 25000 people on both networks. This shows that while many of the accounts that matter most to fashion fans on Twitter are also influential on Instagram there are some notable exceptions. Yves Saint Laurent NYT Styles Times Fashion Style List and more showed up on the Twitter report but not in the Instagram. Conversely accounts such as Coco Rocha Chiara Ferragni Aimee Song Prada Balmain Beyonce and Rihanna show up in the top 200 high-affinity accounts on Instagram but not on Twitter for fashion fans. This shows that despite the common interests these people have across both platforms there are distinct differences in the types of content and accounts that matter most to these people. We performed the same test with Southern NASCAR fans a group with very different interests and affinities than the Fashionista tribe analyzed above. Of the top 200 high-affinity accounts for NASCAR fans on Twitter only 100 of them mapped to the top 200 high-affinity accounts on Instagram. Many of these unique high-affinity accounts on Instagram were accounts run by the wives of NASCAR drivers suggesting that NASCAR fans use Instagram to gain behind the scenes access into the families lifestyle and events of their favorite NASCAR Drivers. What does this cross-platform affinity test mean for marketers? Advertising has traditionally been all about reach but now things are becoming much more personal and highly-targeted allowing for a much more efficient ad spend and higher ROI. This personalized approach is challenging though as it’s critical to select the right platform for the right content. You don’t want to turn off a potential customer by presenting the wrong messaging in the wrong context like Audi did: Luckily Audi listened to their followers and now post mainly car photos. At Affinio we firmly believe that knowing how different sub niche's use each network is key to making the best decisions when developing a campaign. These cross-platform insights are the best way to accurately inform strategy content creation and targeting. Have questions about how we ran this experiment?

,6,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,6,http://www.affinio.com/blog/how-family-loyalty-and-diversity-helped-furious-7-dominate,How family loyalty and diversity helped Furious 7 dominate,This is how the latest Fast and Furious franchise performed at the box office in its opening weekend: Furious 7 the latest instalment in the series brought in $146.5 million in the US and an outstanding $384 million worldwide on opening weekend. This is the 9th biggest opening of any movie ever showing just how far this series has come from its origins as a niche tuner car movie. In a recent Rolling Stone article Eric Thurm refers to the Fast and Furious series as “.. a franchise for the Internet” - which is fitting given the larger than life and highly sharable clips quotes and memes the series produces. After reading his article I was inspired to dig deeper into the culture of the audience of the movies to better understand the different personas the movies attract and the cultures interests and affinities of each. To do this I used Affinio to identify and segment the American followers of @fastfurious into niche tribes of like-minded people - here’s what I found: Tribes within the US audience of @fastfurious The colours above represent groups of like-minded people. Closer dots = tighter niche More dots = bigger niche. The first thing that caught my attention was the lack of a dedicated "car fans" tribe. Given the subject matter of the movie I was expecting to find a tribe such as this one that consisted of hardcore automotive fans. After reviewing the tribes in detail it became clear to me that the latest Fast and Furious movie has a diverse mainstream audience further validating that the series has broken free of its car movie stigma. The closest thing I found was a tribe of gamers intersted in Call of Duty but also had high affinity to NASCAR. This tribe which I named "NASCAR COD fans" are heavily influenced by and have high affinity to these accounts: A much larger tribe at 5% of the total audience was a group of WWE wrestling fans. Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson who stars in the latest film comes in at 27th on the list of high affinity accounts showing that he's able to bring his loyal WWE fans to the franchise. Another interesting tribe was the "Hardcore Bieber/1D fans" tribe which makes up 6% of the total audience and whose high affinity accounts include: To better understand how the movie attracted and retained this audience I reviewed the most popular Fast and Furious related tweets being shared discussed or favorited by the followers of @FastFurious and found the following: Can't thank you all enough for the incredible support. #ForPaul #Furious7 - #TeamPW pic.twitter.com/FbVm8gM5sN — Paul Walker (@RealPaulWalker) April 3 2015 You can never be over-prepared. #Furious7 pic.twitter.com/CVkw7MXEpZ — #Furious7 (@FastFurious) March 13 2015 "That bond will never be broke and the love will never get lost..." - #SeeYouAgain #ForPaul http://t.co/Ecs8AlkAky pic.twitter.com/Q5kRMPS581 — Paul Walker (@RealPaulWalker) April 6 2015 #FastFamily #Furious7Live pic.twitter.com/kTkLYhEJZ3 — #Furious7 (@FastFurious) April 2 2015 Strength comes in numbers. #FastFamily #Furious7 pic.twitter.com/zu0tAqCUXE — #Furious7 (@FastFurious) March 9 2015 "I don't have friends I got family" #Furious7Live #furious7 #premiere #VinDiesel pic.twitter.com/x7qPzV8wBH — #Furious7 (@FastFurious) April 2 2015 .@Tyrese talks about the importance of the #FastFamily. The #Furious7 Trailer Launch Event is TOMORROW on FB & E!. https://t.co/3L2j4q9OI2 — #Furious7 (@FastFurious) October 31 2014 The tweets above show that the audience of the Fast and Furious connected and engaged with content that touched on the themes of family honouring Paul Walker and the diverse and tight knit cast rather than car related content. This strategy of elevating the discussion and themes of the movie above cars to include issues everyone can relate with (family loss loyality) drew in the diverse crowd needed to become a box office success.

,10,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,10,http://www.affinio.com/blog/data-shows-football-fans-love-coldplay,Data Shows Football Fans Love Coldplay,No matter which teams make the game the Super Bowl is always one of the most anticipated sporting events of the year. Last year alone an average audience of 114.4 million viewers tuned into watch the New England Patriots defeat the Seattle Seahawks. This year expects to top that as it marks the 50th anniversary of the event. As big as the actual football component of the Super Bowl is the Halftime show has developed a following of it’s own. Thanks to past acts including Katy Perry Bruno Mars The Rolling Stones and others those who wouldn’t typically watch a football game are watching. That’s why choosing a half time act cannot be taken lightly. Lots of consideration goes into which musician is the best fit not only due to audience suitability but also thanks to risk management (does #boobgate with Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake ring a bell?). With the announcement of the Super Bowl halftime act on the horizon the team here at Affinio analyzed the audience of the @SuperBowl twitter handle back on November 23rd to see if we could predict which musician would be announced for the halftime show (graph of audience above). If the Halftime show selection committee wished to have a band performing the results suggested that Coldplay would be a good fit as the top rated Musician interest (Justin Timberlake Katy Perry and Taylor Swift were Top Ranked Solo Artists). So it came as no surprise when last week the NFL announced that Coldplay was actually going to be headlining the Super Bowl’s 50th Anniversary Halftime show. Even though we knew Coldplay was a great fit for the @SuperBowl crowd we were curious about how they ranked with the more hardcore football fans that follow @NFL. Turns out Coldplay was still a great choice as they ranked almost as high in the musical band section as well. When you’re looking for the next big sponsorship or promotional event it’s important to tap into the interests of the people who already support you. Building on relationships they already support not only makes solid business sense but also leaves your fan-base with an experience they’ll cherish for a long time.,Dan,December 10 2015

,17,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,17,http://www.affinio.com/blog/empire-audience-analysis-what-advertisers-should-know,'Empire' Audience Analysis: What advertisers should know,Advertisers and ad buyers were delighted with an Empire concert on Monday at Fox's Upfront presentation in New York City. Empire is one of the most successful shows to be launched in the last decade and proves to be a fan favourite. Advertisers are more than eager to be a part of such a success - but how do they know they are reaching the right audience? Empire had an amazing first season with 16MM viewers for the season finale catapulting the show into the mainstream and securing a second longer season with 18 episodes. Who are the fans that are absolutely loving Empire? Numbers from Nielsen tell us the demographic information. The show rates highly with adults aged 18-49 especially women aged 18-34. We also know that 62% of the viewers are African-American. But with all of the data available today are you going to make a multi-million dollar ad buy or product placement deal based on broad demographic stats? Without a deeper understanding of who the audience is and what they are interested in how do you know that your product placement or ad will resonate with this audience? How do you know if this is even your target market? Purchasing ad space on a very popular show puts the odds in your favour but couldn't you equate this to throwing enough mud at a wall and hoping some of it will stick? How a social graph analysis of Empire informs brands Looking at the followers of the show and analyzing the billions of network connections that exist within the audience allows us to understand the interests and affinities of the members through who they choose to follow. We can then group the audience into shared-interest tribes. Find more about how Affinio does this. Above we see the audience visualization of the show's audience on Twitter. In the center we see a lot of mixed tribes (shared interests across tribes). More interesting are the distinct tribes that appear around the outer edges. As a brand looking to advertise these tighter shared-interest tribes demonstrates that this audience is much more segmented than the broad description that the demographics suggest. Above we can see the Affinity Scores of each tribe this demonstrates shared interests within a tribe. Many of these tribes are above average but how similar or different are their interests across tribes? Let's take a look. Here are the top 100 high-affinity accounts for 5 of the tribes the exist with the Empire audience: Teen Humour Sports Fans TV + Movie Fans Hip Hop Culture Mothers Looking at these top affinity accounts we can see how they change across segmentations. What interests one tribe would not interest another. This analysis points out the need for more information when making decisions about ad placements and product placement for the 2015/2016 Season.,India,May 13 2015

Inside of these large social communities are small niche “micro communities” that contain niche groups of people who all share similar interests and affinities. Before Affinio discovering and measuring the quality of these micro communities had been almost impossible because the tools and metrics to do so simply didn’t exists. As a result we’ve developed and refined 4 characteristics that will help strategists find score and target micro communities. 1. Engagement (Level of activity) To help content spread quickly and cheaply targeting an active community that will share and spread your message is a must. We’ve found that a leading indicator of whether or not content will be retweeted and shared is to measure the overall engagement of the micro community. 2. Density (Level of interconnectivity) An easy way to think about density is if we took all the people in this community and invited them to a conference how many of them would know each other? The tighter the community the more likely your content is to be perceived as viral if it is shared by a few key community members. Because they are all connected a few shares will look like a lot as they’ll keep seeing your content again and again. 3. Influencer Affinity (Similarity of the people in the community) Influencer Affinity measures how similar the members of a community are to one another. If Influencer Affinity is high this means they are all reading same things buying the same products and talking about the same things. 4. Influencer Uniqueness (How unique a micro community is compared to others) Finally Influencer Uniqueness helps you understand how unique a micro community is compared to others. The higher the Influencer Uniqueness score the more unique (or weird) a micro community is. Apply for a demo Want to segment your audience create better content and place highly targeted ads?

Mapping Knowledge Using The Social Graph,Organizations are creating more content than ever before. A lot of KPIs are based on vanity metrics like shares and likes. Have you ever wondered who those people are that are sharing your content? Are they the people you wrote it for? Are they people you didn't write it for but could be a new target audience? Using Social Graph analysis we've found a way to identify the personas who share your content. Cornell University Library maintains a site that provides open access to over 1Million e-prints on anything from Physics Mathematics Computer Science Quantitative Biology Quantitative Finance to Statistics. You can check it out here. Using Affinio we analyzed everyone who shared content from this site on Twitter in the past 30 days and uncovered the following personas: These personas were automatically generated by analyzing the social graphs of anyone who shared content from Cornell’s online database providing a never before seen view of the types of users sharing and discussing its contents. In addition to segmenting these users into personas based on their social graph Affinio also provides detailed insights on who these groups of individuals are and the things they care about most. As an example here’s some of the data Affinio pulled from the Machine Learning persona: Terms used to self describe: User locations: Most relevant accounts to users: @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow Top used hashtags: Top mentioned accounts: Domains they source content from: Top shared links: Deep Learning Summer School Montreal 2015 ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn [1506.01497] Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks Notebook on nbviewer Optimizing RNN performance [1509.06664] Reasoning about Entailment with Neural Attention deepmind/rc-data [1509.01549] Giraffe: Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to Play Chess [1509.09308] Fast Algorithms for Convolutional Neural Networks A brief history of word embeddings (and some clarifications) - Gavagai - Next generation text analytics.

,22,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,22,http://www.affinio.com/blog/deep-learning-disrupting-social-marketing-and-advertising,Deep Learning: Disrupting Social Marketing and Advertising,Advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence continue to come at an intense pace. Most recently deep learning (pioneered by Geoffrey Hinton who now works at Google applying deep learning to advanced search recommendations) has become the go-to technique for advanced machine learning. Applications for deep learning continue to grow and the deep learning developer community is also expanding around the world. Beyond search applied deep learning has already begun to flourish behind the scenes where many of the leading social media platform companies are scrambling to acquire and build their own deep learning teams in a space-race effort to the best possible performance of everything from content recommendations to ad placements. At Affinio we’re leveraging the power of deep learning to help marketers and advertisers find the audiences they want and communicate with them with an authentic brand voice. Developing an authentic brand voice in niche communities (or “tribes”) on social is challenging. Our deep learning technology not only helps marketers and advertisers identify the right audiences to target on social platforms; but actually suggests what they should say based on what the data tells us. Here’s how Audience Segmentation: Advanced machine learning capabilities allow us to segment social audiences across multiple platforms based on an unsupervised identification and segmentation of naturally forming tribes and extracting the unique features from these tribes. Content Recommendations: Once specific audience segments have been identified we extract the content that is being discussed shared published and reviewed within these communities as “gold standard” from which we recommend content (topics phrases wording images videos etc) that brands should create. Completely data-driven this recommended content is designed to resonate within these communities based on historical data and our predictive models. Ad Targeting: Combining both segmentation and content recommendation capabilities our machine learning technology goes on to suggest who to target as well as keywords images etc to use in ad design. By analyzing the real-time performance of these ads our deep learning algorithms optimize ad content and feed its “learnings” back to the segmentation and content recommendation engines. Our deep learning algorithms were developed leveraging 3rd party data but as we continue to work with brands and agencies directly and monitor the brand’s 1st party earned data from the published content and ads our technology grows stronger and more accurate literally on a daily basis. Deep Learning versus Old Style Data Mining Many companies are mining the rich data set that comes from the social media firehose to attempt to extract meaning and value. Affinio’s deep learning approach is unique in that our ability to capitalize on superior: Audience coverage: Affinio fundamentally analyzes the social graph not just firehose data. As a result we collect “signals” from each individual’s network and follower patterns on social media. So instead of only analyzing the 10-20% of people who author something on social we analyze everyone. Signal-to-Noise ratio: By leveraging our “tribe” segmentation technology Affinio is able to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio for its deep learning algorithms that produces better more accurate models based on richer cleaner “gold standard” data from the firehose. Prevailing algorithms that analyze only the firehose succumb to low signal-to-noise ratios (very high volume of “noise”) where true signals are lost and accuracy suffers. By considering and analyzing BOTH audience segments AND the content emerging from within these segments (instead of content only) Affinio’s deep learning models are ultimately more accurate. What Next? With the advent of Custom and Tailored Audiences (Facebook Twitter and now Instagram) we’re able to rapidly build audience segments develop content models test and optimize copy to hone our deep learning algorithms. Our vision is to bring programmatic efficiencies to social strategy content development and copy. With the rich massive data sets emerging from social media the application of deep learning in the marketing and advertising space is limitless. We’re excited to be a part of the disruption to come.,Tim Burke,August 06 2015

,25,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,25,http://www.affinio.com/blog/call-of-duty-understanding-the-fans-of-this-10b-franchise,Call of Duty: Understanding the fans of this $10B franchise,Call of Duty Black Ops has just been announced with a release date of April 26th and it's expected to be one of the most popular games ever released. Since Activision created the award-winning Call of Duty (COD) franchise in 2003 franchise revenues have exceeded $10 billion worldwide. One game in the series Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2 had opening week sales of over $500 Million worldwide becoming the biggest entertainment launch of all time In late 2014 Activision released an infographic stating that over 125 million people have played Call of Duty since 2010. Viewers also watched over 5 million hours of CoD livestreamed gameplay on Twitch. These insane revenue and engagement numbers highlight just how large and loyal their fanbase really is. The series is so large that professional gamers and clans such as FaZe and OpTic have emerged creating and sharing gameplay videos that routinely garner millions of views. The Call of Duty franchise has 2.71M followers on Twitter. Using Affinio I was able to dig deep into this audience to understand the fans of this $10B franchise. The graphic above shows the different groups of like minded people I was able to find within the audience of Call of Duty. Each colour represents a group of people (we call them tribes) and the density of the dots shows the similarity/density of each tribe. The 3 tribes that contain the most dedicated CoD fans are the Hardcore CoD players FaZe clan fans and OpTic clan tribes so I dug into these groups to better understand the people who love Call of Duty the most. To start I looked at where these people were located: How the members of these tribes self-described: High affinity/influential accounts to tribe members: Top used hashtags: Top mentioned accounts on Twitter: Top shared videos by people inside of these tribes: Top shared links by people inside of these tribes: Call of Duty Call of Duty® eSports | 2015 Championships Scuf Gaming ® on Twitter #BackInBlack MLG Pro League Advanced Warfare Season 2 NaDeSHoT Steps Down?!

The three tribes analyzed above consist of around 331000 people which highlights just how great of a job the Call of Duty team has done of nurturing and supporting their fanbase. They may have millions of followers and a massive marketing budget but die hard fans like the people in these tribes that flood the internet with user generated content and keep the franchise top of mind for so many of their friends.

,26,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,26,http://www.affinio.com/blog/fifty-shades-influencing-teen-girls-views-healthy-relationship,Fifty Shades - Influencing teen girls' views of a healthy relationship?,There's no shortage of buzz surrounding the Valentine's Day release of the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' movie. Analysts say that the film is poised to dominate at the box office. Fandango is reporting that this is the fastest selling R-rated film in the website's history especially in the more religious Southern states including Missippi Arkansas West Virginia and Alabama where pre-purchased tickets are outperforming other movies by as high as 270%. Opposed to this surge in ticket sales are some anti-porn activists claiming that this is an unhealthy portrayal of the relationship between a man a woman. They have created their own campaign around #50DollarsNot50Shades asking people to donate $50 to battered women's shelters instead of seeing the movie. In the UK @50ShadesAbuse has rallied supporters for a protest claiming that the film 'glamorizes abuse'. So we decided to take a deeper look at the audience of @FiftyShades. But first let's look at how the film is attracting all of this attention. How are they generating all of this buzz? According to a recent article by Variety the 'Fifty Shades' marketing team has been planning their movie release strategy for the last 3 years researching their target audience. They know that their target is heavily female skewed aged 30+ and likely married and they know that their audience isn't necessarily interested in the 'heinous' sex scenes. They understand that it's more about the mystery and allure of the male lead billionaire Christian Grey. Aside from the 'shocking' nature of the film the 'Fifty Shades' marketing team is using a similar tactic to the 'Hunger Games' films by using memorable quotes combined with art from the movie to help connect fans to the film. This is content that gets people excited and is easily shareable - they are promoting on many platforms including Twitter Pinterest Facebook and TV. But who is this content resonating with? Are they actually targeting the right audience? After analyzing the @FiftyShades audience on the Affinio platform we are able to see how the audience is segmented. While we found some general tribes of young women and moms there were also distinct niche tribes. These tribes included (not-surprisingly) "Female TV/Movie Fans" "Fifty Shades Mega Fans" "UK Mommy" and "Southern US Mom" (this may be the women driving the ticket sales). What really stood out to us though was that over 35% of the audience comprised of young women and teen girl tribes including 'University Girls' 'Beliebers' 'Directioners' and 'Vampire Diaries Fans'. Let's look at two tribes - one that the film is 'intentionally' targeting and one that they aren't (or shouldn't be) - the 'US Southern Moms' and the 'Beliebers'. Looking at the profile pictures and twitter bio keywords you can definitely see the difference in tribes. It's when you get into the tribe influencers and content that it's clear that 'one tribe is not like the other'. Members 'US Southern Mom' - Subset of Tribe 'Beliebers' - Subset of Tribe Top Bio Keywords: Unique Influencers of Each Tribe: Unique Influencers of 'US Southern Mom' Tribe Unique Influencers of 'Beliebers' Tribe Top Five Links Shared by 'US Southern Moms' Fandango "Fifty Shades of Grey" Movie Review 2015 SuperBowl Budweiser Commercial "Lost Dog" Vine of JayZ reacting to Kanye at Grammys Tweet re voting on winner of SuperBowl Magic Mike XXL Trailer Top Five Links Shared by 'Beliebers' Justin Bieber and Ellen Scare Audience Members Justin singing 'So Sick' by Ne-Yo Fandango "Fifty Shades of Grey" Movie Review Vine - Justin Bieber 'Hey Bob' Video of Justin's apology regarding recent behaviour Keep in mind we are talking about a movie that is about BDSM and that we are looking at a tribe of teenage girls who idolize Justin Bieber and are influenced by people/brands ranging from iCarly Disney Radio and Nickelodeon to Fifty Shades of Grey and E L James... a scary thought for parents of teenage girls out there. What are your thoughts on the audience that the @FiftyShades handle is attracting?,India,February 12 2015
,27,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,27,http://www.affinio.com/blog/using-discovery-to-analyze-your-personal-brand,Using Discovery to Analyze Your Personal Brand,In the Age of the Internet of Things more data about ourselves is online and accessible than ever before. Whether it is our presence on social media channels like Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Instagram etc. the breadcrumbs we leave on every web page visited and every search term Googled or one of the thousands of devices such as Fitbit and Nest that bring our offline lives online; the world around us is interconnected more than ever before. All this information out there about us means that it is much harder to separate our personal lives from our business lives. We have entered a new era where the buyer is in full control of the buying cycle with an abundance of information at their fingertips. Since it’s so easy to search someone online products are no longer being sold between businesses – the exchanges feel as though they are being made on a personal level. With an abundance of personal and professional information available people already have a preconceived notion of you before you’ve even met them in meetings. Whether it’s from creeping your LinkedIn for past jobs & experience scanning your Twitter feed or reading past blog posts and news articles about you your customers are forming first impressions of you before you even meet. With this information in hand it is more important than ever to consciously manage what your online persona says about you. Motivational speaker Jim Rohn once famously stated that we are the average of the five people that we spend the most amount of time with. If we take this same approach to social media we can get an idea as to how our online personas line-up with how we want to be perceived to the outside world. This emphasis on the importance of monitoring and managing your personal brand make us even more excited to talk about the recent launch of Discovery by Affinio. The application uses the Affino platform to analyze a person’s Twitter network giving you insight into your network of followers. Discovery by Affinio gives you great insight into your online Twitter persona as the people that are following you are either people that you know offline or those you’ve attracted online through the thoughts and content you’ve shared. Identifying this information allows you to quickly see how how your Twitter audience aligns with your desired online persona. Is what you’re sharing attracting your desired audience? Or is it time to shift your attention to address gaps where you wish you held more influence? Running Discovery by Affinio to analyze my Twitter followers shows 6 distinct audience groups as well as one general followers group that are primarily relevant to my interests of marketing . All areas that I frequently talk about organically without putting much thought into the persona I would like to develop online. In aligning each of my 6 distinct groups with Jim Rohn’s comments on our selves being the sum of those who we spend time with the Twitter persona of Dan Stratton connects quite well with the online persona that I wish to have. It clearly indicates my love for working in the digital marketing space as well as my love and passion for Atlantic Canada (where I moved 6 years ago) and Ottawa (where I went to school and lived for 8 years). Diving into each group gives me tons of information about each segment to help me learn more about top accounts they are interested in popular words from their bios and where they are located. For example when I analyze my Halifax group further I uncover some of the other top account this group is following which mostly relate to other marketers and brands within the city. Analyzing the bio's of this group also provides insights into the type of people I typically interact with around the city (and are in turn following me on Twitter).

While these "debates" (I use the term loosely) are interesting to read the results are always heavily skewed to fit a users personal opinion. Music like any art is highly subjective and requires the viewer or listener to feel and respond to the work so a user generated list is almost impossible to accurately create. That said I was interested in identifying and building a list of rappers that had the highest relevance and affinity to rap fans on Twitter. Instead of simply looking at the follower counts of popular rappers I used Affinio to compile a list of around 500000 rap fans on Twitter and calculated the affinities of each rapper on Twitter to these fans. The goal of this exercise was to generate a list of “rappers rappers” or a list of rappers that true rap fans cared about most. To do this Affinio analyzed over 1 Billion relational connections and Millions of social accounts to come up with the following list of top 10 rappers on Twitter based on their influence and affinity to rap fans on Twitter: 1. Lil Wayne Tweets by @LilTunechi 2. Eminem Tweets by @Eminem 3. Wiz Khalifa Tweets by @wizkhalifa 4. Drake Tweets by @Drake 5. Ludacris Tweets by @Ludacris 6. Big Sean Tweets by @BigSean 7. Kendrick Lamar Tweets by @kendricklamar 8. Meek Mill Tweets by @MeekMill 9. Snoop Dogg Tweets by @SnoopDogg 10. J. Cole Tweets by @JColeNC In addition to calculating a list of the top 1000 relevant accounts to rap fans on Twitter Affinio also analyzed all the content being shared by rap fans and presented an overview of all the content that mattered most this month. Below are the top 10 tweets that rap fans on Twitter favorited in the last month: Hello Twitter! It's Barack. Really!

,33,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,33,http://www.affinio.com/blog/how-broadcasters-and-major-brands-may-be-affected-by-periscope-and-meerkats-growth,How Broadcasters and Major Brands May be Affected by Periscope and Meerkat's Growth,This past May Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao squared off in the boxing ring for what was anticipated as “The Fight of the Century”. With headlines hyped to this extent for a single event it’s not surprising that it was one of the most profitable sporting events broadcasted to date. With a total of 4.4 million pay per view orders that equated to over 440 million dollars in television revenue alone. However it's possible HBO and Showtime may have been able to generate even more from the broadcast if it hadn’t been for two little apps by the names of Meerkat and Periscope.These apps can be downloaded using a smartphone and allow users to record with their camera and create a live stream feed for anyone else using the app to tune in and watch. During the fight thousands of people were able to find a way around the costs associated with the standard ways of watching the fight whether it be through television or seeing the event live. These keen observers tuned into live streams generated from spectators in the arena using Meerkat and Periscope and therefore were easily given access to view a match for free that others were charged large amounts for. Some believe that this is breaking broadcaster’s TV lucrative rights as HBO and Showtime generated $440 million in pay per view revenue but questions still arose around how much more they could have made if these apps weren’t put into play during the bout. To give a better idea of the number of people that were able to avoid paying to watch the fight there were over 10000 users that tuned into a single Periscope feed from the crowd in MGM. If Periscope and Meerkat continue to develop a presence in the distribution of sporting and other televised events the question brands must be asking themselves is how and when should they begin to work towards gaining leverage in these new platforms? The “how” will have to be determined by the companies themselves. In terms of the “when” at Affinio we looked to find brands that should be interested in taking advantage of this opportunity as soon as possible. Using our algorithms we ran a report of the combined followers of both @periscopeco and @AppMeerkat. 18 tribes were surfaced in the report and we chose to analyze the US Sports Fans tribe. This was an obvious first choice as the traction that the two apps have gained from the controversial live streams are streamings of sporting events. We wanted to look for insights into what brands these fans may have high affinity to. These are the brands that should be taking the most initiative towards looking at leveraging advertising into these sports streams. The top five brands found in the interests tab in respect to this tribe were recorded: Starbuck Nike Netflix Jordan Nike.com The biggest takeaway we found from this group of companies ranked is interestingly enough but not surprising by any means Nike was the exclusive sports brand that currently seems to have the largest potential in increases of consumer engagement and interest to their brand from the usage of Periscope and Meerkat. Nike and Nike.com were both in the top 5 in addition to Jordan another spin-off brand of shoes owned by Nike. This ranking greatly assists in showing the brand(s) that would seemingly prove to be most beneficial if the use of Meerkat and Periscope to stream events in sports is to continue and grow in popularity. Conclusively this relatively new growth of Meerkat and Periscope in terms of use towards viewing live commercial events has the potential to begin to greatly affect major corporations. However as shown through the Affinio analysis these influences may not necessarily be all negative. Of course for television broadcasters falls in revenue made off of viewers could begin to take place but for an advertiser's standpoint this may be a whole other platform with great potential to have their products and brand get in front of even more engaged and relevant consumers. As shown Nike is a prime example of a brand that should take advantage of and be excited by this growth in live streaming apps. It will be interesting to see in the near future if these apps continue to acquire audience numbers from television broadcasters whether or not certain companies and brands try to leverage their ads to these platforms and if so which brands other than Nike may see opportunity to to try and take the leap.,Jacob Burke,October 13 2015
,34,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,34,http://www.affinio.com/blog/periscope-vs-meerkat-whos-leading-key-audience-segments,Periscope vs Meerkat - Who's leading key audience segments?,Meerkat and Periscope have made live streaming interesting again - but is there room for both apps in the market? These two apps allow you to wirelessly live stream video where you are. There are other options available but Meerkat and Periscope are more prevalent due to a lot of buzz and big financial backers. Meerkat was launched during this year's SXSW creating a ton of buzz. Periscope launched later in March is owned by Twitter who purchased them a few months before. Celebrities and mainstream news journalists have adopted these apps offering authenticity to the general user base. Snapchat started the revolution of ephemeral and instant communication. These live streaming apps are continuing this trend - Meerkat videos disappear immediately Periscope will stay for 1 day. TechCrunch reported a few days ago that Periscope is winning the 'Live Streaming Battle' by "nearly half a percentage point in terms of monthly active users on ios." While Periscope may be leading the race I wanted to check out who's leading in the segments within their audience. The following analysis was done using Affinio. Affinio looks at the billions of network connections that exist within an audience and segments them into tribes of like-minded people based on affinities and interests. This analysis looks at the combined audiences of Meerkat and Periscope over the last 30 days. Periscope vs Meerkat: Audience Segmentation Audience details: @AppMeerkat: 347000 followers @PeriscopeCo: 94400 followers Audience Visualization Audience Engagement The combined audience of Meerkat and Periscope have a highly engaged audience. Anything above 20% 'Tweeting Users' suggests an above normal activity level. Shared interest and friendliness of tribes The following shows the shared interests (affinity) and the interconnectivity (familiarity) within each tribe. Ownership within an audience segment The following is a breakdown of who owns the communities that exist within the combined audiences of Meerkat and Periscope. This data is normalized to offset the difference in audience size. Software Developers Comedy Fans Spanish Students Italy NASCAR Fans Teen Girls Fashion and Beauty Christians News and Politics US Sports Fans As you can see while Periscope may be winning in terms of monthly active users - Meerkat has a firm grasp on many of these communities.

Nextflix has done a great job promoting the new season with the dramatic trailer launched on January 11th an 'accidental' release 3 weeks early and the daily countdown of dramatic clips have everyone buzzing. This is Washington. There's always a leak. All 13 episodes will launch February 27. — House of Cards (@HouseofCards) February 11 2015 The hype has fans sharing how committed they are to putting their lives on hold this weekend to sloth it out on the couch and binge watch the full season: Clearing my schedule to binge @HouseofCards this weekend — Atik Khan (@AtikKhan) February 25 2015 My plan for this weekend is to throw on a groutfit and sit on my couch watching @HouseofCards straight through. Maybe twice if there's time. — Connor Neuville (@cnevs77) February 25 2015 But was it a Sesame Street parody that spiked the buzz? After analyzing the @HouseofCards audience on the Affinio platform we discovered two things (among others). First that Sesame Street's 'House of Bricks' appeared in all of the tribe's top shared content. Second that there was a spike in audience growth rate timed nicely with the release of the parody on YouTube. Daily Audience Growth Rate of @HouseofCards Sesame Street did a great job creating a piece of content that truly resonated with the House of Cards audience as a whole. Based on the diversity of the audience this is no easy feat. One that even Frank Underwood may sweat over. Created by Ann Morrison As one of the three little pigs asked: "So who ya talkin' to anyway?" Our report on the @HouseofCards audience revealed 14 tight tribes of like-minded individuals who span the globe. The most notable communities are the fans who are actually involved in real life politics - a 'Washington Politics' tribe and a separate tribe of 'International Politics'. The largest tribes also included a distinct 'Dad' tribe and a separate 'Mom' tribe. This was interesting as we normally see one or the other depending on what we are analyzing not both. @HouseofCards Social Graph Analysis of 'Washington Politics' Tribe Let's learn more about what interests the real politicians in Washington.

,36,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,36,http://www.affinio.com/blog/secret-oscar-winner-emma-watson,The Secret Oscar Winner - Emma Watson,I remember when they announced the cast of the first Harry Potter movie and thinking Hermione was exactly how I pictured her when reading the novels (admittedly only reading 3/7). Who knew this child star would surpass the stardom of the epic JK Rowling series movies and become the megastar she is today. Not only for her acting chops but for the absolutely amazing human being she seems to be. Since July of last year when Emma Watson was appointed UN Women Goodwill Ambassador (just after graduating from Brown University) we have seen her use her platform in an outstandingly classy and admirable way. Here is a list of newsworthy moments in the past 6 months: Her historic Speech at the launch of the UN #HeforShe gender equality campaign She was rumoured to be dating Prince Harry but squashed this in the most feminist way She gave another amazing speech highlighting the success of #HeforShe and launching the IMPACT 10x10x10 framework Most recently Emma wrote a hand written note to Steve Carrell thanking him for wearing #heforshe cufflinks and the world went nuts over it. Starting this post I was looking to write something related to the Oscars. Perhaps an analysis of the people mentioning #Oscars or an analysis of the audience of Neil Patrick Harris. While doing my research I couldn't help but notice Emma Watson's face showing up over and over. Not only did her penned note to Steve highjack Oscar news everywhere Emma Watson shows up as an influencer to every community within the @TheAcademy audience. Let's break it down After analyzing the @TheAcademy audience we were able to break it down into several tribes of like-minded people including a General Followers Filmmaker/Producers Movie Enthusiasts Fashion Theatre/Books Beliebers/Directioners US Moms and then some geo-specific tribes. While Ms Watson appears in all of the tribe's list of influencers she absolutely dominates a couple. She is the top influencer of the 'Theatre/Books' tribe and 2nd most influential person to the 'Beliebers/Directioners' tribe (second to Zac Efron). While dominating some (maybe obvious) tribes it was her position in the 'Filmmaker/Producers' tribe that I found most interesting. Here are the top 200 influencers: Oscars - Film/Producer Influencers (Click image for list of influencers) If you look at this list it makes sense - lots of major studios and major brands related to the film industry. But for this analysis let's ignore those. Let's look at where Emma sits compared to the other actors/producers who top the list. I called her a 'megastar' some may disagree at this point in her career. Seeing who she sits with on this list is it an indication of Emma Watson's staying power in the industry? Based on where she has taken her career thus far I'm excited to watch (and participate) over the coming years. Tom Hanks Leonardo DiCaprio Hugh Jackman David Lynch Joseph Gordon-Levitt Ron Howard Stan Lee Kevin Spacey Samuel L Jackson Ellen DeGeneres Jim Carrey Ian McKellen Emma Watson Ben Affleck James Cameron Robert Downey Jr Simon Pegg James Franco Jon Favreau Steve Martin Jimmy Fallon Russell Crowe Mark Ruffalo Barack Obama Ben Stiller To find out more about how we did this analysis check out Affinio's Approach (Image credit: Emma Watson),India,February 25 2015
,37,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,37,http://www.affinio.com/blog/mapping-the-cultural-zeitgeist-of-your-customers,Mapping the cultural zeitgeist of your customers,The Zeitgeist (spirit of the age or spirit of the time) is the intellectual fashion or dominant school of thought that typifies and influences the culture of a particular period in time. Understanding the Zeitgeist of the time and more importantly of your customers is critical to creating content and strategies that are effective. In marketing every detail matters - you need to have a deep holistic view of your customers world and know every aspect of their lifestyle if you want to connect with them. At Affinio our goal is to help brands and agencies make their customers happier by understanding who they are and what they care about most. To do this we start by segmenting an audience into tribes. A tribe is a tightly connected group of people who share similar interests and values. Once we’ve identified the tribes within your audience we extract the psychographic insights needed to create a detailed archetype/persona for the members of each tribe. We extract what they read who they are influenced by what they discuss where they live the devices they use their professions and more. If you’d like to see an example of how Affinio maps the Zeitgeist of your customers apply for a demo. Request a demo,Brian,November 10 2014
,38,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,38,http://www.affinio.com/blog/macys-wwe-common,What Macy's and the WWE Have in Common,You may think you know who your audience is but let me tell you there IS a difference between what you set your target market to be and what your audience really is. While you may be targeting to a certain demographic sometimes within your audience there is a tribe of people that you least expected. Last month with the highly anticipated release of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' we conducted an analysis in which we found that 35% of the audience were made up of young women and teenage girls - an audience we weren't expecting to see. This got us excited to explore other brands to see what else we could find. The analysis we conducted on Macy's really drives home the point that the marketing efforts you pursue over time influence what your audience looks like. Here is an overview of the tribes we found in the Macy's audience of ~760K followers: A number of these tribes are what we would expect to see: fashionistas beauty/makeup followers and moms. What I found intriguing is the small but mighty tribe of WWE followers. When I initially saw this I thought "really? WWE and Macy's? How is there overlap here?" Before jumping to why there is a WWE tribe in the Macy's audience I first wanted to explore an expected tribe Fashionistas compared to the WWE tribe. The 'Fashionistas' tribe is: 325x more likely to self-describe as "accessories" 283x more likely to self-describe as "fashion" 278x more likely to self-describe as "style" 201x more likely to self-describe as "jewelry" 190x more likely to self-describe as "designer" Let's dig deeper and see what content is really resonating with this tribe. Here you can see the top hashtags (left) and top mentions (right) that this tribe of people use: Here are the influencers for the 'Fashionistas' tribe: The top 10 unique influencers to this tribe are: Business of Fashion Stella McCartney V Magazine DVF Alexander Wang Times Fashion Net-a-Porter New York Times Styles The Council of Fashion Designers of America London Fashion Week Finally here is some of the most-liked content by the 'Fashionistas' tribe: Now let's look at the 'WWE' tribe. This tribe is: 8607x more likely to self-describe as "wwe" Here's what that looks like: You can see the top hashtags (left) and top mentions (right) - clearly much different than the 'Fashionistas' Tribe. These are the influencers for the 'WWE' tribe. This tribe has a lot more 'unique influencers' than the 'Fashionistas' tribe does. The top ten unique influencers for the 'WWE' tribe are: Daniel Bryan Dolph Ziggler Nikki & Brie Big Show A.J. Chris Jericho WWE Sheamus Shawn Michaels Nattie WWE R-Truth Here's a sample of what content resonates the best with them: Now the burning question: why does Macy's audience have a 'WWE' tribe? Where is this relationship coming from? For the past 7 years Macy's has teamed up with Make-a-Wish America for National Believe Day. The event happens annually where the Macy's and Make-a-Wish work together to make wishes come true for 50 children in the US. In late 2014 one boy's wish was to meet WWE star John Cena and before he knew it he found himself in St. Louis meeting Cena thanks to Macy's and Make-a-Wish America. Back in May 2013 WWE and the Children's Wish Foundation International teamed up to make a little girl's dream come true by inviting her to a live WWE Monday Night RAW event. These aren't the only two instances that Cena has helped make wishes come true. Cena has reportedly helped make over 400 children's wishes come true. This year's National Believe day is happening on December 12 2015 and if you're interested in donating to the cause click here. There are no efforts that are too little or too large. Not only is it amazing to see Macy's team up with a great charitable cause but we speculate that their efforts have generated enough buzz to attract a tribe of people they aren't actively targeting - the WWE tribe.

,39,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,39,http://www.affinio.com/blog/data-shows-who-directv-should-place-in-their-nfl-ads-next,Data shows who DirecTV should place in their next NFL ads,(Photocred: DirecTV) The NFL is one of the most profitable and recognized sports leagues in the entire world. In the world of advertising it’s not surprising that businesses and organizations have worked towards putting their brands in front of NFL audiences for as long as it’s been possible to do so. Currently with the versatile and dynamic digital era that we’re in today an obvious favourite has been advertising through commercials being aired during televised NFL games. DirecTV is an example of a company that has taken significant advantage of these commercialized opportunities showcasing their own services (particularly NFL Sunday ticket) through different commercials that are known for their originality and cleverly thought out nature. This includes the infamous “Football on Your Phone” ad with Peyton and Eli Manning and others with former and current NFL athletes such as Andrew Luck Tony Romo and Randy Moss. With the NFL season in full swing as of last week we were interested in looking into the brands and companies that consistently use this sports league as a marketing platform and DirecTV was an obvious choice. With a report run on the twitter followers of @DIRECTV  Affinio’s algorithms came up with 14 distinct tribes as shown. One thing that each of DirecTV's NFL related ads consist of is an NFL athlete. Most commonly Eli and Peyton Manning but as stated earlier the broadcasting company has recently branched out with other ads starring the likes of Andrew Luck and Tony Romo. We wanted to look into what other NFL athletes (if any) DirecTV should possibly consider or may be overlooking in regards to what players they choose to advertise and promote NFL Sunday ticket due to their potentially high affinities to the DirecTV audiences as well. Seeing as how DirecTV’s ultimate goal with NFL Sunday Ticket advertisements is to target as many football related audiences as possible the tribe we chose to analyze was the American Football Fans tribe. The top 1000 relevant profiles of interest in relation to this tribe and using Affinio’s award-winning technology these profiles were filtered into Celebrities and then once again into strictly Sports Stars profiles. NFL athletes with high recognition to DirecTV’s audience’s interests in this tribe were searched for in this group of profiles and what was found was rather interesting. The first five NFL player profiles found in the tribe’s interests tab and their rankings overall in the tab were: Johnny Manziel (#88) Drew Brees (#90) Aaron Rodgers (#91) Larry Fitzgerald (#104) Robert Griffin (#111) Now of the four current NFL players that have appeared in DirecTV commercials of recent (Tony Romo Andrew Luck Eli Manning and Peyton Manning) Tony Romo is the only player with a twitter account. So the next step was to look for the Cowboy’s star quarterback to see where he ranked amongst these other athletes. When searched Romo’s profile wasn’t ranked until profile #980 in the tribe’s interests tab. Although Romo has been featured in DirecTV commercials lately he isn’t found in DirecTV’s football fans audience’s relevant interests until over 800 profile rankings lower than all 5 other NFL players listed above; whom have all yet to make an appearance in any DirecTV advertisements. So it seems that if DirecTV is looking to continue to feature NFL players in ads angled towards football audiences they should consider giving the parts to any of the five listed above as they all currently have a significantly higher affinity to DirecTV than that of Tony Romo. In conclusion the use of these other players by DirecTV theoretically should create a greater recognition for DirecTV as these athletes hold a greater relevance towards the audiences also interested in DirecTV and their services.,Jacob Burke,September 25 2015

,42,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,42,http://www.affinio.com/blog/100-years-of-racing-whos-watching-this-years-indy-500,100 years of racing - who's watching this years Indy 500?,(photo: Visit Indy) The Indianapolis 500 is one of the most historic and important races in all of motorsports. Greats such as A.J. Foyt Mario Andretti Mark Donahue and Emerson Fittipaldi have spent the last century battling at the brickyard at over 200 miles per hour to join the fabled Indy 500 winners list. While the sport has grown and evolved a lot over the years the Indy 500 has always remained one of the pinnacles of motorsports - attracting a diverse audience of racing fans from around the world. To better understand who these racing fans are I used Affinio to segment and analyze everyone who followed @IndyCar on Twitter to help get a better idea of the various types of people who are actively following Indy today. Tribes found within the audience of @IndyCar: This segmentation was performed by looking at the interests and affinities of everyone who follows @IndyCar. To do this Affinio analyzed over 155000 people and the billions of relational connections that link them to uncover the various audience segments within Indy's fanbase. These tribes of people were found using unsupervised segmentation meaning I didn’t have to tell Affinio what I was looking for - it simply uncovered everything that was there. In some cases the tribes broke out based on the geography of the fans. Things such as local news celebrities languages and culture of a region all play an important part in the segmentation. Other tribes shared more in common and ended up being subsegments of the same core fanbase. The 3 tribes of NASCAR related fan groups are a great example of how psychographic profiles can differ between fans of the same sport. Diving into a segment reveals a lot about who these people are and the things that matter most to them. The people who belong to the "Southern US NASCAR/Sprint car" tribe which makes up 5% of the total Indy audience live in the Southern US enjoy NASCAR and dirt track racing get their news from Fox favorited these tweets more than any others: Thanks to all for a remarkable day my teammates @NASCARONFOX.

Of these shared accounts the following are the ones that matter most on twitter to these tribe members: High affinity accounts to southern US NASCAR fans: After reviewing it's not surprising that these top affinity accounts are filled with NASCAR drivers teams announcers and related accounts. Affinio analyzes every tribe member and generates a custom list of high-affinity accounts for each tribe. Here's what the Formula 1 (F1) tribe has high affinity to: The content they care about is also different from the Southern US NASCAR fans here’s a sample of the most favorited tweets by the members of the F1 fans tribe: #OnThisDay 21 years ago the racing world lost the heroic and brilliant Ayrton Senna. #ForeverInOurHearts #RIPSenna pic.twitter.com/nuoX7YNBWh — McLaren (@McLarenF1) May 1 2015 Revised McLaren-Honda livery to debut at the #SpanishGP.

Which brand should sponsor which driver? Which ads should we show during the race in each region? What content do our fans care about most? Which fan segments should we try to grow?

It’s a quantifiable passion that is certainly more than a job for everyone on our team. Whether it’s tracking every song we’ve listened to since college measuring the exact engine power of our vintage BMW or monitoring the wind maps for an upcoming sailing trip each of us has our own data vices beyond our shared passion for Affinio social data. My recent data vice has been monitoring my running and cycling pursuits with Strava a running and cycling app that tracks your runs and rides via GPS and publicly ranks your best timed "segments" against other users. Coupled with a heart rate monitor this app captures and calculates your efforts into metrics like KOM (King of the Mountain) or QOM (Queen of the Mountain) for the fastest leader board time and Suffer Scores which allow you compare the duration and intensity of your run or ride with other users. We used Affinio’s audience builder capabilities to look at people who follow @Strava and who also live in New York City. Our algorithm found 6 niche tribes of users who follow Strava and live in New York. These tribes or communities of users with common interests and affinities are represented in the social graph below: Here is how these users self-describe: How engaged these users are: Time of day that users tweet: Time of week that users tweet: Looking at the New York Strava audience as a whole here are the top 200 interests of the audience members: Diving deeper you can look at each tribe on an individual basis: understand the members their interests and the content that resonates the most with them.

,44,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,44,http://www.affinio.com/blog/what-debate-between-the-left-and-right-sides-will-ensue-from-the-irandeal,What debate between the Left and Right Sides will ensue from the #IranDeal?,(image source: shoebat.com) On Tuesday July 14 Iran and six other world powers including the United States reached a deal to lift trade sanctions on Iran while imposing strict limits on the country’s nuclear program. Under terms of the accord Iran will dismantle much of its nuclear infrastructure while the UN US and EU will remove many of the embargos placed Iran over the last decade. While the people of Iran celebrate the United States Congress will decide its support for the deal in what is expected to be a heated debate between Democrats and Republicans. Most Democrats are in favour of the deal however there are some key Democrats who aren’t quite on board. We already expect that the next 60 days will be intense as Republican leaders have vowed to fight in order to derail the deal. Other countries and their leaders also have strong opinions and concerns to voice. Israel’s prime minister Binjamin Netanyahu denounced the deal saying the world is “a more dangerous place” as a result of the agreement. While French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius called the deal a “step forward” but not a “final destination.” We looked at people who used #IranDeal over the last 30 days to understand what audience segments are talking about this monumental agreement. Below are the audience segments that were found: Since there is a highly anticipated debate between the right and left sides we wanted to further explore the context in which each side was using #IranDeal. The following tweets are either created or retweeted by members within the tribes. Here’s what the Right Side is saying about the #IranDeal: Did any U.S.A. citizens being held prisoner in Iran get released as a condition of this deal? #TheArtOfBadDeal #IranDeal #Iran — Dennis J.

Congress has 60 days to review the deal and it looks right now like it might come down to some tight votes. Using Affinio we will be monitoring the report to analyze how the debate shapes up and which audience segments are leading the conversation as the news breaks.

,45,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,45,http://www.affinio.com/blog/not-secret-tribe-men-found-mentioning-thebachelor,The not-so-secret tribe of men found mentioning #TheBachelor,Whether or not you're a fan of ABC's 'The Bachelor' I'm sure you've come across people on your Twitter feed tweeting about this season's bachelor Chris Soules aka "Prince Farming." The season finale aired this past Monday and over the weekend up until Tuesday we analyzed how much #TheBachelor got mentioned. At first I thought it would a shot in the dark to find a compelling report but the tracked hashtag #TheBachelor got ~65000 mentions over the course of just a few days. Here is an overview of the types of people that mention #TheBachelor: I want to swing your attention to the fact that there is a tribe of primarily 'US Men.' Yes I was secretly hoping a tribe like this would show up but did I really expect that there would be a distinct tribe made up of mostly men? Definitely not this is a completely unexpected tribe. I know what you're thinking "this tribe must be a group of bots or a complete fluke" I can confirm that they are in fact actual users as you can see below: Let's dive deeper to better understand this tribe. Here's how they self-describe: Now we know that these men are pretty big sports fans looking at their influencers you can tell that they're definitely big sports fans: The Top 10 Unique Influencers of this tribe are: Adam Schefter Deadspin Bleacher Report Bill Simmons Scott Van Pelt Jay Bilas NFL Johnny Manziel Chris Mortensen Buster Olney Here are the top hashtags (left) and top mentions (right) by the users of this tribe: Now it's one thing for the members of this 'US Men' tribe to even be mentioning things related to The Bachelor but in what context are they using them in? Here are some sample tweets where these men mention #TheBachelor: And some who were found live-tweeting their thoughts: The rest of the audience comprised of tribes we expected: general followers moms Bachelor superfans and bloggers. What I found intriguing is the number of similar tribes comprised of teenage or college-age girls. Here's how some of the users of the 'College girls' tribe self-describe: Here is who influences these 'college girls': The top 10 Unique Influencers to this tribe include: Vodka Vendettas College Town Life Sorry I'm not Sorry Your Away Message Betches First World Pains Post-grad Problems Diamond Diploma Total Soror Move Sex and the City Quotes The same night of The Bachelor finale they announced The Bachelorette I mean Bachelorettes for next season. Here's how some of these Bachelor fans reacted: It looks like our Bachelor fans are not crazy about the idea of two Bachelorettes some saying that it's degrading to women and a practice of misogynistic behavior. We already saw how the BDSM film 'Fifty Shades of Grey' influences teen girls. Considering the fact that the majority of the audience that mentions #TheBachelor is some variation of teen or college-aged girls how will this new season of The Bachelorettes influence these girls?

Traditionally marketers have built buyer personas to help personify their ideal customers. Today we're swimming in customer data but for the most part we're still building target personas based on simple demographics or snippets of conversations. To truly understand your customer you need to go beyond this. Understanding customer segments through their interests allows you to relate to your customers through what they are truly passionate about. One way to do this is through leveraging the social graph. Here's how you can use Affinio to build data-driven buyer personas based on customer interests. Define your audience Affinio looks at an entire audience then groups individuals into tribes of people with simialr interests. There are several ways to initially define this audience: Your current followers on Twitter Instagram or Pinterest: This allows you to understand you already exists in your audience so that you can find more people like them. Your competitors followers: Understand your competitor's key audience segments better than they do. People who mention a given term(s): Define your audience by the hastags mentions or keywords they use. People who share a particular piece of content: Find out who the people are that are sharing your content (or any other content on the web). As an example we've looked at anyone who follows @BananaRepublic on Twitter. Below is the audience visualization. You can see how the audience has grouped into different interest tribes. Let's look at the 'Stylists' tribe to see how Banana Republic might use this information to create a data-driven persona. 1. Interests First let's find out what pulled these people together. Here are the top 200 contextually relevant accounts to this tribe of Stylists. From this we can see that the 'Stylists' follow a lot of brands and publications related to the Fashion industry not surprising but insightful. If you were Banana Republic what could you do with this information? Identify the true interests of this target segment to better understand this community and what they care about most. Identify traditional and digital media outlets to place advertisements (Vogue Who What Wear Elle etc) Identify traditional and non-traditional celebrity influencers to partner with on large campaigns (Rachel Zoe Bryan Boy Olivia Palermo Zooey Deschanel) Identify sponsorship opprtunities 2. Content Next let's get an idea of the culture of these Stylists through the content that they create share and enegage with over the last 30 days. Top used Hashtags: Top Favourited Content: Top Account Mentioned: Top Visited Domains: 3. Members Finally let's look at how the members of the Stylist tribe community self-describe. Top Twitter Bio Keywords Locations Pulling it all together Now that we have a great idea about what this community is interested in and the content that resonates with them we have a better understanding of how Banana Republic could relate to this community. Let's take a stab at quickly summarizing this persona: The Stylist persona can be described as an individual living in the world's largest cities who is brand and fashion conscious. Style consumes their everyday from the moment they wake up planning what they are going to wear their social feeds and the content they read to get their day going. The Stylist takes pride in knowing the latest trends and having their finger on the pulse of what's next. Their idols include Fashion's greats and the modern models of today. To visualize the 'Stylist' we pulled some of this data together to visualize their interests and passions: How can you apply Data-Driven Personas? Carry the knowledge of these personas around with you to make better business decisions: Inform your strategy Place advertisements where they count Data-driven creative that you know will resonate Customer service Product direction and design Inform partnerships with Brands and Influencers To learn more about creating your own data-driven buyer personas check out our guide below: Here is a sample of the data-driven pitch persona report we've put together using Affinio.

That’s exactly what we are doing at Affinio. It’s called “eating your own dog food” and it is the most compelling way for us to demonstrate the value of our technology - by using it to rapidly grow our own company. Over the last few months we noticed we’ve been gaining significant traction with digital and social strategists in agencies who were using Affinio to identify and target niche tribes build detailed personas from our data-driven psychographics develop targeted briefs and strategies and ultimately win new business. So to prove our technology and build our own case study we thought it would be smart to target and convert digital and social strategists through Twitter Tailored Audience ads using Affinio. The results have blown our minds captured the attention of Twitter and have made for a very compelling story to share with the strategists planners and analysts who have signed up for a demo. This is how we did it (and how you can too). Step 1: Build a target audience We began by building an audience of people who had digital and social strategy related terms in their Twitter bio. Step 2: Identify our tribe Our algorithm then detected 6 tribes within this audience. Of these tribes we selected the one whose highest affinities were to the top agencies and influencers that we wanted as customers and were also highly connected to one another (high density) to maximize the impact of our ads if/when they were shared. Influencers of our target audience: Step 3: Generate a targeted advertising list Once we identified our target tribe we generated and exported a look-alike Tailored Audience list of 200000 high-affinity individuals to this target tribe. Step 4: Import list to Twitter We uploaded our Tailored Audience list into our Affinio Twitter ads account using the audience manager. Step 5: Create Ads Based on the content that was already being shared in our target tribe (which we discovered using Affinio) we generated ad imagery and content that we knew would resonate. We added a pixel on our signup page to track conversions from our Twitter ads. Step 6: Place highly target Twitter ads We launched the campaign and watched the sign ups start rolling in. Here are the titles of the leads we are attracting: With Affinio we are proving that Twitter is a great platform for both B2C and B2B marketing. We have actually turned off our Google LinkedIn and Facebook ads because their targeting gives us lower quality leads at a much higher cost.

For those of you new to Dreamforce it’s an annual event where Salesforce customers partners developers come together to share what they’ve learned and make big announcements for the year to come. Up to 150000 people are expected to attend so it’s one of the biggest tech events of the year. To help both new and returning Dreamforce attendees out we used Affinio to analyze the followers of @Dreamforce on Twitter to come up with the ultimate guide of who’s attending and what they’re currently talking about. Tribes found within the Dreamforce audience: Affinio’s segmentation is unsupervised and relies on network connections rather than tweets which means that we were able to segment all 55.2K followers even if they’ve never tweeted about Salesforce or Dreamforce before. Our algorithms analyzed and segmented everyone in the audience into tribes automatically meaning we didn’t tell it to find developers in India or Digital Marketers it just noticed they were there and automatically grouped them Diving into these tribes provides deep insights into who these people are and the things they care about most. As an example we dove into the tribe comprised of primarily Salesforce sales and dev team members allowing us to gain an insider’s view of what Salesforce has discussing most leading up to Dreamforce.

,49,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,49,http://www.affinio.com/blog/the-long-tail-of-brand-affinity,Steph Curry and Nike's Long Tail of Brand Affinity,Stephen Curry has captured the attention of sports fans around the world throughout his career and the largest amount of his spotlight has been caught during his 2014-2015 stellar MVP winning season. Now just a week ago he added another trophy to his repertoire as the Golden State Warriors overtook the Lebron James led Cleveland Cavaliers 105-97 in Game 6 of the NBA Finals. With media now virtually always pointed Curry’s way he has presented himself as a confident but humble player who is unnaturally laid back on and off the court. A family man who just recently gave fans more reasons to smile when he began to bring his daughter to interviews during the Warriors playoff run. Being the crowd pleaser that he is with a championship and season MVP won in the same year it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that this is who the NBA is looking to push as the new and upcoming overall face of the league. That said what brands and companies should be or are partnered with Curry to benefit from targeting new and broader audiences following basketball? Using Affinio’s audience insights platform we can find brands and products that should be looking for opportunities to snag the attention of certain customers. We ran an analysis of Stephen Curry’s followers on twitter and discovered many distinct audience segments. Tribes found within Curry's audience: We chose to analyze the NBA Fans tribe and the General Sports Fans tribe because the members of these tribes have the most interests in common. Looking at the Twitter accounts that are most relevant to these tribes we pulled out the top brands that these tribes have high affinity to. NBA Fans tribe: Pros Better My Game (105) Jordan (110) Nike Basketball (112) Nike (143) NFL (152) SLAM Magazine (165) Nike.com (175) Youtube (199) Adidas Basketball (206) General Sports Fans tribe: NFL (24) NBA (32) MLB (79) Sports Illustrated (99) Jordan (135) Nike (168) Nike Basketball (170) Nike.com (199) MLB Network (205) CNN (253) This is where things get interesting. As you can see Nike Nike.com and Nike basketball are three parts of the Nike brand that are found common in the top ten of both tribes. This is something to focus on because these three Nike assets were found in both tribes based on their relevance to the followers of Stephen Curry. Curry ended his Nike endorsement deal in September 2013. He chose to move on to a different deal with Under Armour. So where does Under Armour appear in Curry’s audience affinities? The answer is that although Curry has had an endorsement deal with Under Armour for a little under 2 years now they are in fact very difficult to find in the list of relevant profiles. In the NBA Fans tribe with the highest affinity score of all tribes in the report Under Armour does not even sit in the top 1000 profiles of relevance while Nike Nike Basketball and Nike.com are all between profiles 112-175. And in the General Sports Fans tribe Nike Nike Basketball and Nike.com sit in between profiles 168-199 in the list while Under Armour is not found until profile number 620! Even with this change in partnership occurring more than a year ago Nike continues to reap the rewards of customers recognizing their brand with high affinities to Curry. We then ran a report on the followers of Nike and Stephen Curry was the 11th player listed in their audience’s affinities on the list of overall relevance to the followers of Nike. Below you can see the top 10 being Lebron James Kobe Bryant Kevin Durant Chris Paul Carmelo Anthony Dwight Howard James Harden Blake Griffin Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook. Every single one of these NBA players has an endorsement deal with either Nike or the Nike/Jordan brand with the exception of Dwight Howard. Despite not having a contract with Nike Curry is still very influential to the followers of the Nike brand and has the second highest relevance of any player who doesn’t have a deal with Nike currently. This helps verify the fact that Nike is still very much benefiting from the attention Stephen Curry is gaining from people with interests in basketball. Clearly with the endorsement deal with the Golden State star Under Armour’s goal is to work on penetrating this consumer audience. But from what is shown from our analysis Nike still has a firm grasp as a highly influential and recognized brand in the basketball community and although Under Armour is endorsing the league MVP they still have quite a lot of work ahead to grab the attention of this group of consumers. This is a prime example of the long tail of a brand affinity without paying Curry a dime Nike continues to reap the rewards of customer interest thanks to their ex- endorsee's MVP and NBA championship run in 2014-2015.,Jacob Burke,June 23 2015

Instead of placings ads and interrupting people inbound works by attracting (earning) qualified leads by providing great content that adds value. By creating and sharing content that matters to your target audience you can attract high quality leads for the fraction of the cost of traditional paid acquisition methods. At the core of inbound marketing is great content and at the core of great content is a buyer persona. You need to understand your ideal customer on a deeply personal level before you can create the content needed to attract them. How people make personas today Traditionally creating a buyer persona was a mix of digging through your CRM and analytics googling someone else’s buyer personas and guessing (lots of guessing). With these sources you could piece together a rough buyer persona and start creating content to attract them. The problem with this approach is you have no idea what to make and share because you don't understand what they like. All you have is their demographic details (names ages income ranges and job titles) and what you really need are their psychographic details. Demographic vs Psychographic The problem with demographic information is that it tells you very little about a persons interests attitudes or opinions and instead focuses on the hard facts (name age location income). While this information can be useful it's very hard to develop content for an age bracket because people of the same age all have diverse interests opinions and needs. If you want to know what a person cares about most you need to dig into their psychographic profile. Psychographic insights include the personality values opinions attitudes interests and lifestyle of a person - everything you'd need to know to create compelling and engaging content. By understanding the interests of your ideal customer you are able to create highly personalized content that attracts and educates. How Affinio automates persona creation Our award winning technology is able to analyze massive social audiences and automatically find and create the different personas within your audience. Here's how it works: Step 1: Define the audience of people to analyze. This can be the followers of your brand a competitor people who live in a certain region anything.

Step 3: Once we have the persona's segmented we present insights on who they are what they like read share post mention tag are influenced by and more. We even include the most relevant links and content to your target audience giving you the most data rich content marketing cheat sheet available.

,52,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,52,http://www.affinio.com/blog/1-billion-worth-of-beer-drinkers-looks-like,What $1 Billion Worth Of Beer Drinkers Looks Like,In the late 1990's Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR) was dying. With sales at an all-time low and with death in sight they needed to find new customer segments to buy and drink their beer. Over a period of 10 years Pabst has nearly tripled its sales and lined itself up for a billion dollar acquisition. How did they do this? The key is niche markets. On it’s own a niche market wouldn’t be big enough to sell 300+ Million liters of beer to but if you combined it with 20-30 other niche markets you’d have a growth machine. To find these niche markets we segmented the followers of @pabstblueribbon using Affinio. Affinio analyzed the interests and affinities of everyone in this audience and assigned each user to a interest-based buyer persona. Persona's found within PBR Instagram audience: The graphic above maps the top 14 buyer personas that have powered this massive growth engine. Individually each tribe isn't enough to sustain Pabst but together they have pushed it into a brand worth $250 Million. To better understand each buyer persona Affinio provides a psychographic profile for the members of each tribe. Insights include most relevant accounts top hashtags photo locations and even emoji’s.

The data extracted above provides valuable insights into who these various buyer personas are and the people brands and content that matter most to them. All good marketing strategies start by truly understanding the target customer and with Affinio you can find and understand high value niche audiences in minutes.

Now that you know who matters and where to place your content you need to make some data-driven content that you know your target audience will love.

Affinio provides the top posts by tribe members and top accounts hashtags and keywords being used in photos making it easy to quickly understand the types of content that perform well within this niche. Stop making content decisions without data it takes way too long and costs way too much to build a campaign without backing the direction up with data!

When looking for articles tips and tricks to help stay ahead of the competition cutting through the noise to find the content that truly matters can be difficult especially on social media where everyone is a self-proclaimed expert or guru. Finding relevant thought leaders and ignoring the fakes has been a challenge as there is no easy way to find the accounts that truly matter to specific audience or market. At Affinio we looked at this problem and realized that if we analyzed everyone in an audience identified a tribe of people that represented the ideal audience of the researcher we could generate a list of the most relevant accounts to a specific tribe by analyzing the network graphs of everyone inside that tribe. To find the most important accounts to digital marketing we started by analyzing the audience of Affinio to find a tribe of digital marketers. Once found Affinio automatically analyzed the social graph of everyone inside this tribe and identified the accounts with the highest relevance to the tribe members. This process figured out the accounts that mattered most to these tribe members on Twitter creating the perfect “must follow” list for anyone who’s moving up the ladder and stay current in digital marketing.

Much of the data that is collected and actioned upon is based on demographics. Is this enough to inform your marketing strategies? If you think about it I'm sure we could all point out cases where the target market may be a bit 'off' or ignoring an important audience segment. E-consultancy did a summary post of all the horrific social media fails of 2014 highlighting the need for better understanding when it comes to understanding your audience. For example on Audi's Instagram handle they launched a campaign posting images that weren't cars - this was not well-received by their audience: @econsultancy How can we help prevent these marketing disasters from happening in the future? How can we give our customers what they want? Understanding your audience through psychographic insights will help you delight your current audience and attract others. This is where the social graph comes in. Every action we make indicates something. Who we choose to have relationships with online indicates what we are interested in and have affinities for. Analyzing the billions of connections that exist within a social audience reveals segments of people with shared interest profiles. Layering content on top of this foundational analysis allows us to provide context to messaging. Affinio is an award-winning technology that allows us to mine these connections in minutes (not days weeks or years). Here are 5 reasons why an analysis of the social graph is a requirement for market research: 1. Audience Segmentation Affinio allows you to break any social audience into tribes of like-minded people. We do this by analyzing the Social DNA profiles of everyone in an audience and then segmenting them based on their interests and affinities. 2. Tribe Member Information Once an audience is segmented into tribes Affinio extracts deep psychographic information on who these people are. We start by showing you tribe members where they live and how they self-describe. Engagement devices and popular tribe generated content are also presented. 3. Interest and Affinity Mapping We present the contextually relevant accounts to tribe members. We do this through our own niche ranking technology which derives relevance influence and affinity from each member's shared interest profile. 4. Contextually Relevant Content We also include top content topics opinions hashtags and domains - ensuring you are always up to speed on the culture and discourse of any tribe. 5. Competitive Intelligence Knowing your audience is great but knowing how they stack up to their competitors is better. Do you have anything to add? Let us know in the comments below!

So who follows the church of Yeezus?,"I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go ... I'm like a machine. I'm a robot. You cannot offend a robot ... I'm going down as a legend whether or not you like me or not. I am the new Jim Morrison. I am the new Kurt Cobain ... The Bible had 20 30 40 50 characters in it. You don't think that I would be one of the characters of today's modern Bible?" — radio interview with Tim Westwood 2008 Kanye has twice as many people following him on Twitter than the Pope. Now I'm not going to be the one to state that Kanye is more powerful than the Pope but Jay-Z did once say that "men lie women lie numbers don't" so I'll let the numbers do the talking. To better understand the followers of Yeezus I used Affinio to analyze and segment all 11.2 Million people into tribes of like-minded people. Types of people who follow Yeezus: Global reach of Yeezus: (Map of where all the followers of Kanye are located based on profile data) Key characters in the book of Yeezus: (These are the most influential accounts of all 11.2M followers of Kanye. Click the image to download them as a .csv) Cultural icon in music art design and fashion: It's no secret that Kanye wants to express his creative genius in as many mediums as possible. His interdisciplinary nature is reflected in the followers he attracts. Here's a breakdown of a tribe of young up and coming rappers that Kanye influences and inspires: Influencers of young rappers: Top used hashtags by young rappers: Top mentioned accounts by young rappers: Top shared links by young rappers: 1.

,61,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,61,http://www.affinio.com/blog/the-business-of-sports-sponsorship-whos-using-sportsbiz-on-twitter,The Business of Sports Sponsorship: Who's using #SportsBiz on Twitter?,Have you ever been curious about the people who share your content? Ever noticed them adding messages or hashtags that are specific to their field or audience and wonder what it means? Recently our team has written a few articles on the sports industry and sponsorship deals within it and wanted to learn more about the hashtags our audience was adding to them when shared. As we do with all of our posts we shared them on our Twitter feed. This is a new vertical for us to create content on so it was interesting to watch who the content resonated with. When people started engaging with the posts we saw that a fair amount of the shares the hashtag #SMSports and/or #SportsBiz had been added to the tweet. We wanted to learn more about who was using these tags. We ran an analysis of anyone using the two hashtags over the last 30 days to better understand our audience. The Affinio algorithm groups all the unique people who mentioned one or both hashtags then segments them into tribes based on the individual's affinities and interests. Here are the results: As you can see it makes sense that these tribes would be using #SMSports and #SportsBiz. Because the 'Sports Biz Sponsorship' tribe is most relevant to the articles we produced let's learn more about this community. First of all this is a particularly interesting tribe because of the high amount of shared interests and affinities. Also it is an extremely interconnected tribe suggesting that many of the members know each other (they follow each other). To analyze further let's find out the interests of this tribe how they self-describe in their bio keywords the other hashtags that they use regularly and the content that resonates with them. Top 200 Relevant Accounts Top 10 Bio Keywords #SportsBiz Sales Sponsorship Athletics Marketing Alum Director Entertainment Tweets Professional Top 10 Hashtags Used by Members of this Tribe #nacma15 #nacda15 #sponsorship #smports #usopen #stanleycup #shebelieves #uswnt #periscope #marketing Top Shared Links within this Tribe Study offers ideas on how to get students to games and keep them there A New Game Plan The NBA Just Changed the Game for Watching Sports Online 2015 NBA Finals -- Cleveland Cavaliers hire 2 international marketing firms The power of branding in college football Reviewing this data allows us to understand and learn more about the culture of the tribe that showed interest in our articles. Having this data allows us to better understand our audience why they are interested in certain posts and what we could produce in the future that would resonate with them. As an example we noticed that #Periscope was in their Top 10 Hashtags and that #SportsBiz is a top bio keywords. To learn more about how this community is using Periscope we could analyze the content of anyone on Twitter that has the bio keyword #sportsbiz and mentioned #periscope. It could be an interesting insight into how the Sports Sponsorship world is using Twitter's live streaming app. If you would like to understand the hashtags that your audience uses when sharing your content get in touch! We'd love to help you further understand your audience.,India,July 24 2015
,62,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,62,http://www.affinio.com/blog/dark-social-media-peeling-back-layers-lurker-analytics,Dark Social Media - Peeling back the layers with Lurker Analytics,The majority of social media users don't engage with the content they read. We all know this but it seems as of late more and more social media marketers are trying to reach their lurker audience and bring them into the conversation. The term 'Dark Social' is common these days (or a variant called Grey Social) referring to those who share information but not in the way that we want our readers to. Instead of clicking on the 'share buttons' on the post (conveniently located to the left of your window wink) readers will copy and paste the URL in an email or social message directly to their friend or co-worker. This leaves us with no way to track this engagement and thus being in the dark. The lack of ability to track these engagements leaves us to wonder how effective our content truly is. It also poses a challenge to those who work in the digital marketing world as to how to show the performance all interactions and amplification of their content to their boss or client. So how do we get lurkers to come out of the shadows and participate? Over the weekend I read a post on Mark Schaefer's blog called "Can the Onion Theory bring social media lurkers into the light?" by Brooke Ballard. In the post Brooke discusses the 'Onion Theory' and how it may apply to engaging 'lurkers' or people who observe but never (or rarely) participate in the conversation. From Brooke's post on The Onion Theory: The psychology behind it says that by disclosing information about yourself to your community you will activate reciprocity with some of your members thus creating a relationship and trust. I strongly recommend reading this if you haven't already. The post goes on to talk about the different levels of conversation brands have (or the different layers of the onion). 'Superficial' being the most common level of conversation moving to 'Intimate' 'Personal' and finally 'Core'. It's rare to find brands communicating at the Personal or Core level. Brooke suggests that revealing more and communicating on a more personal level will help encourage the lurkers to participate in your conversation. I agree with Brooke - being more open with your audience will (or should) encourage them or make them feel invited to participate thus bringing some of the lurkers out of dark. Emily Post's book on 'Etiquette' (1922) discusses the proper way to have a conversation how to encourage one and what to avoid. She states that to have a meaningful conversation you must "Talk about things which you think will be agreeable to your hearer." I propose that sharing more of yourself is just a piece of the puzzle knowing more about your lurkers and gearing your conversation towards them is the key to solving it. How do you appeal to your lurker audience if you don't know who they are? This is where audience insights based on the social graph come in what we like to call Lurker Analytics or #LurkerLytics as our CEO Tim Burke put it while attending the Brand Innovators Summit in New York last week. After reading more information about the Onion Theory and learning more about how to have a 'proper conversation' I decided that there is another side to this. If I may let me introduce to you to The Lurker Onion: The Lurker Onion looks at the different layers of audience insights you can achieve through analyzing the social graph. Peeling back the layers you are learning about what makes a lurker tick - what they are interested in what truly resonates with them. This is the other half once you know more about your lurker audience only then can you have a meaningful conversation - perhaps one-sided at first but using their language will help draw them out of the shadows. How do you discover the affinities of a Lurker? In Brooke's post she states that she and Mark Schaefer have been on an endless quest: Mark Schaefer and I have been on a seemingly endless quest to understand dark social media gray social media and the people who may love your company but stay in the shadows. We have the answer Brooke! Let's take a look at Mark Schaefer's audience to see what we can learn about his lurkers and what may be 'agreeable' content for them. The following information comes from the Affinio platform after doing an analysis of @markwschaefer followers. Affinio looks at all of the members of an audience analyzes the network connections among them then groups the members into like-minded communities or tribes. @MarkWSchaefer Network Graph Mark's audience has a smaller 'lurker percentage' than the norm (around 90%) as his audience is comprised of mainly people who work or are associated with the social media world. @MarkWSchaefer Audience Engagement Let's take a closer look at the 'Innovation/Data/Tech' tribe The members of this tribe have been grouped together based on their Social DNA. The following is the content that lays on top. So even if someone never speaks these are the people most like them who do come into the light. Bare with me here I have a lot of data to show you. The following will look at how this tribe self-describes their location the content they share and who/what influences them. Starting with how a tribe self-describes gives us our first indication of who the members are. Here are the top bio keywords: Next location gives us a little more information we can see that the members of this tribe are mainly located in the United States and the UK with some visibility in India and Australia: What about content? Here are the top used hashtags (left) and mentions (right) from this tribe: Here are the top 10 links shared within this tribe over the past 30 days: Exclusive: Google is developing its own Uber competitor The shape of things to come Twitter reaches deal to show tweets in Google search results Commun.it Forbes Quotes fo the Day Inc.com The world's 50 most innovative companies FT.com UK nytimes.com internet.org by Facebook We know that Mark Schaefer is an influencer of this tribe but who else is? Here is a graphic of the top 200 influencers of this tribe - the people/businesses/celebrities in which they have top affinities to. (Click the image to download the full list of twitter handles). In this list we see a fair amount of common influencers or at least expected ones for Mark's audience. So what makes this tribe different? Here are the top ten unique influencers to this tribe (influencers that do not appear in Mark's other tribes): Dave McClure Mark Suster Reid Hoffman Fred Wilson Gigaom Eric Ries 500 Startups Kara Swisher Steve Case Michael Arrington Just looking at this brief analysis we are starting to understand the members of this tribe a lot better. This data allows us to engage in conversation (or produce content) that is agreeable to our 'hearers' or Lurkers. By creating content that mirrors what this tribe is already interested in and what truly resonates with them I argue that you increase the chances of bringing the lurkers into the light. What are your thoughts on The Lurker Onion? Don't be a lurker and let me know in the comments below!,India,March 02 2015

,64,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,64,http://www.affinio.com/blog/what-do-publishers-care-about-most,Discover and monitor the niche communities within your audience,There’s a great 37 signals blog post about building products that solve your own problem. It says that when you solve your own problem you create a tool that you are passionate about. A few months ago we began powering high performing ad campaigns using our audience discovery and targeting algorithm. We were excited about our early success and wanted to start sharing our story - but we were new to the industry and wanted to know the best people with whom to share our story. We also wanted to know who our potential customers were what they talked about what they liked who they were influenced by what content they shared and where they live. As an experiment we mapped out the different niche communities within adtech and overlaid the top trending content and people within each. What we saw was encouraging and with some tweaking it became amazing - we had built the ultimate adtech cheat sheet. Everything that mattered to our customers was visualized for us. Top trending content most mentioned accounts most used hashtags key locations key events it all just came pouring out. We immediately knew we had something that would change the way people found curated and measured content. As an example we took everyone on Twitter who’s an “Editor” and broke it out into the different communities using our cluster detection. Most influential accounts and top shared links Data from 04/08/2014 - 04/09/2014 Notable communities we discovered include: Managing and Senior Reports American Journalists Canadian Journalists European Journalists UK Journalists Fiction Fashion Music and Entertainment Film Food and Health Sports Managing and Senior Reports Influencers: The following accounts are the most influential to the users inside of this community.

To better understand the customers and followers of GoPro Affinio ran an audience audit on their followers. Our award winning technology segmented their audience into niche communities and extracted psychographic insights on each. Report source: Tribes we found within GoPro's follower base: The network graph above is a visualization of all the different types of people who follow GoPro. Our segmentation algorithm found 14 communities (we call them tribes) by analyzing the social DNA of all 3.6M followers. Tribe breakdown by size: Density of tribes: Density shows how interconnected each tribe is. The higher the number the more people inside a tribe know and follow each other. Similarly of the members of each tribe: Tribes with high scores are tight groups who all share similar interests and affinities. These are the ideal tribes to target with niche content because you know the tribe members all like the same things. Exploring the surfing tribe Affinio allows you to dive into any tribe to learn about who they are what they mention and who they are influenced by. Influencers: These are the most influential accounts to the surfing tribe. We look at the social DNA of every tribe member to determine the most relevant accounts specific to this tribe. Unlike Klout or other influencer tools we find the influences of each tribe than a generic list for the entire world. Members: These are the dominate terms in the bio's of tribe members. The colored bars represent that terms usage in each tribe so in this example the purple tribe is a surfing ocean coastal tribe.

This gave our algorythms 131748 people to analyze and after reviewing the interests and affinities of all of them it broke the audience into 12 distinct tribes. One of these tribes was a User Experience focused group of 8622 people. Top used terms in the profiles of these 8622 tribe members: These users were 28 times more likey to self describe as "usability": Affinio also analyzes all the content that these users talk about and share allowing us to map out the content websites and topics that matter most to these user experience users.

,69,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,69,http://www.affinio.com/blog/how-we-developed-affinio-to-be-the-perfect-tool-for-strategists,Report Analysis: Deep Focus 2014 Digital Marketing Outlook,When Deep Focus shared their 2014 Digital Marketing Outlook in January we were encouraged to see that our roadmap overlapped with some of their observations and predictions. 10 months later we revisited the document and created this post to highlight how our product has grown to address the needs of cutting edge marketers in 2014 and beyond. “Marketers that don’t ﬁnd ways for their brand's voice to be heard authentically in social and mobile will ﬁnd them drowned out in traditional media channels including digital display advertising.” - Deep Focus (p.6) We've spent the past few months working with leading brands and agencies to help them better understand their customers by providing the psychographics insights they need to create authentic content that resonates with their ideal customers. To do this brand and agencies run an "Audience Audit" on their social audience to find the different niche tribes that a brand's customers belong to. Once we find and segment their customers into tribes we extract key cultural insights (content interests influences etc) and provide them with the insights they need to understand and connect with their customers in a deeply personal way. “The big idea can no longer be a single word that a clever writer can say in a board room and then drop the mike as they get showered in praise and Lions. Instead it needs to be a rich concept that has enough depth meaning and yes human consumer intelligence behind it to drive these hundreds of communications. It needs to be able to answer simple but terrifying questions about how a brand should behave and what it should say (and shouldn't). This kind of thinking is exceptionally important today.” - Deep Focus (p.6) Understanding how a brand should behave requires a deep understanding of the context in which a brand operates. We like to think of social media as a giant high school - lots of people in one place who all belong to some sort of niche community or tribe. If a brand wants to market to people inside of a certain tribe they need to understand the culture and discourse to gain the trust and enter their circles. Affinio digs deep into these tribes to provide the insights brands need to understand each tribe. “Getting valuable or interesting content at the exact moment it applies is the “holy grail” of breaking through the noise. Case in point the second screen experience. A piece of content that’s published at the right time during a television show and targeted to the right people can take off within moments. All because it has the context to back it up. The moral of this story: Content may be King but only if it knows what the consumer is doing.” - Deep Focus (p.11) This quote above all others in the report got us the most excited. Affinio’s audience audits provide a view into everything that’s going on and matters most to a niche tribe. We’ll show you what they are talking about who they are engaging with the content they are sharing and the accounts they are influenced by - all the things you need to develop valuable and interesting content at the exact moment it’s needed most. “But there is a third area of opportunity that vendors have yet to address: identifying trending stories in the cultural zeitgeist that brands can comment on to reinforce their social voice.” - Deep Focus (p.20) Affinio is the first product to truly map culture in real time without sampling or relying on incomplete data sets. We identify niche audiences and extract the contextually trending stories influences hashtags and more.

,71,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,71,http://www.affinio.com/blog/x-games-athletes-and-the-energy-drinks-that-fund-them,X Games athletes and the energy drinks that fund them,The X Games founded in 1995 are the Olympics of extreme sports and are considered one of the most valuable events for marketers trying to tap into Gen X and Gen Y. The athletes who compete at the X Games are the heroes of the youth of the today and kids all around the world are skating and biking every day with the dream of becoming the next P-Rod Birdman or Nitro Circus driver. These influential athletes are extremely valuable to brands so it's no surprise that these athletes are covered in youth-oriented brands when they compete: Photo: Christian Pondella As you can see in the images above energy drinks are one of the biggest advertisers within extreme sports. Their high-profit margins and affordable price make them the ideal product to sell to teens as nothing makes jumping off a 10-foot ledge on a bike more exciting than a massive caffeine and sugar rush! To ensure X Games fans are drinking their product and not one from a competitor energy drink brands are always competing to get their brand on the hottest new talent in each niche. Up until now there has been no way to accurately quantify the relevance of a person to a niche target audience which meant that brands were in the dark as to who they sponsored. Affinio is the first company that can find a niche audience then inform brands who they should be sponsoring to maximize their relevance in that niche. Here's how: To start we took the 843318 people who follow the X Games twitter handle (@XGames) and used Affinio to segment them audience into tribes based on their interests and affinities. Tribes found within the X Games audience: As an example let's say that a brand is interested in 4 of the tribes within the X Games audience. These tribes Motorcross Skateboarding Motorsports and Ski/Snowboarding fans (labeled above) all have their own unique cultures influencers and stars. Affinio maps out which accounts matter most to each tribe making it easy for a brand to see who matters and who they should sponsor to gain influence over a key audience segment. To better illustrate this we took the top 20 athletes who influence the fans of each tribe and then mapped the energy drinks brands that sponsor them to get a better idea of which brands have the most visibility and share of audience within each sport. As the images above show mapping relevant accounts to key audience segments is easy using Affinio. In this example we were able to map the representation each brand has within an audience segment as well as identify highly relevant athletes that are available for sponsorship. This also makes it possible to identify audience segments where brands have room to improve - an example of this would be AMP's absence in the Motorsports and Skateboarding tribes. This functionality allows media buyers and advertisers to instantly measure the relevance of any athlete brand TV show or piece of content to a specific high-value audience segment. Are you looking to segment your audience identify high-value audiences then understand the key accounts and content that matters most to them?,Brian,July 15 2015
,72,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,72,http://www.affinio.com/blog/may-the-4th-be-with-you-hockey-fans-brits-and-jedi-knights,May the 4th be with you: Hockey fans Brits and Jedi Knights,Aside from October 31st the fourth of May marks the only day of the year where wearing costumes is not only acceptable – it’s encouraged. Star Wars nation is donning lightsabers and Vader masks today as it pays homage to the timeless franchise marked by the ubiquitous salutation “May the 4th be With You”. With the UK conveniently on a bank holiday today and North America set to begin waking up there should be no shortage of Star Wars related tweets. Twitter has created symbols to be adorned to Star Wars related tweets. The hashtags #StarWarsDay or #MayThe4thBeWithYou will net you a miniature storm trooper while the variant #MayTheFourthBeWithYou reveals C-3PO’s face. In anticipation of today I used Affinio to segment and analyze @Starwars audience in order to get a better idea of who was following the franchise. I initially expected to see a combination of segments (or 'tribes') consisting of pop culture comic book and film fans as well as what I like to call ‘Jedi Knights’ – those diehard Star Wars fans whom (quite literally) self-describe as Jedi. The tribes I found were in line to some degree with those expectations but other groups I hadn’t expected to see bubbled up to the surface. Here’s an overview of the tribes I discovered using Affinio: At first glance those tribes I had expected to see were present. More interesting however were some of the more obscure tribes that surfaced. Hailing from the North myself I was pleasantly surprised to discover a group of diehard hockey fans (otherwise known as Canadians). Canadian Hockey Fans High-Affinity Accounts A glance at high-affinity accounts for this tribe practically spells Canadian. Let’s examine how they self-describe: Top 10 Bio Keywords Bio keywords validate our initial hypothesis: leafs hockey beer (unofficial synonyms for Canadian). For added measure I thought it would be interesting to compare the Canadian Hockey Fans to a tribe of Brits from the United Kingdom in order to contrast their unique passions interests and affinities. Brits High-Affinity Accounts Right away you can see the stark differences between the two tribes based on high affinity accounts. Where the Canadian affinities related almost exclusively to hockey (no surprise there) the Brits differed in that their highest affinities were primarily to soccer pop-culture and political related accounts (Top Gear ranking the highest after Star Wars). Here’s how they self-describe: Top 10 Bio Keywords Terms like liverpool fc and football serve to validate the insights we could glean from the high-affinity accounts page: that these indeed are Brits from the UK. This is just a snapshot of a much larger dataset we have available to help us easily identify tribes and analyze their social DNA. Now the fun part: have a look at the ‘Jedi Knights’ high-affinity accounts page: Jedi Knights High-Affinty Accounts This is certainly the franchise's core fan base and its internal engine for growth and Star Wars Universe content. Let’s take a look at how they self-describe: Top 10 Bio Keywords Without a doubt – the force is strong with this tribe. Here’s what they’re currently talking about: Top Hashtags and Mentions The data reveals a great deal of insights. Members from this tribe hail from all parts of the galaxy – from as close to home as Coruscant to the far reaches of the outer rim. By digging deeper into a social audience we can gain insight into their world the tribes they live in as well as their unique passions interests and affinities. May the 4th be with you; and beware the revenge of the Fifth - especially for those on holiday in the UK today.,Ryan Hogg,May 04 2015

,74,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,74,http://www.affinio.com/blog/the-data-behind-why-mayweather-deserves-80-million-more,The data behind why Mayweather deserves $80 million more,© STEPHEN WEBSTER Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are facing off in what many people are calling the fight of the century. The fight is available on pay-per-view Saturday May 2nd and is expected to be purchased by over 3M people for ~$100 each. Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s pay is expected to be over $180M and Manny Pacquiao is expected to clear about $100M after the fight - making it the biggest payout for any two fighters ever. The decision to split the revenue 60/40 between the two fighters was based on Mayweathers impressive pay-per-view track record. After analyzing the social audiences of both fighters its clear that Mayweather is the pop culture hero who's attracting a broader audience to the fight. Before diving into the data here's a brief rundown of the contenders: Floyd Mayweather (photo 360nobs) Age: 38 Record: 47 wins 0 defeats 0 draws 26 knockouts. Career earnings: $420 million Manny Pacquiao (photo HBO) Age: 36 Record: 57 wins 5 defeats 2 draws 38 knockouts Career earnings: $340 million In preparation for the big event I used Affinio to combine and analyze the followers of both fighters to get a better idea of who will be tuning into the big event. When combined their audiences contained 7010889 users which were segmented into 18 distinct personas and interest groups. These segments (also known as tribes or communities) contain users who all share the same interests and affinities. Tribes found: In addition to segmenting the audience Affinio extracted psychographic insights on each tribe. To better illustrate the people within each tribe I've included the top 100 high-affinity accounts for each tribe as well as the share of voice each fighter has within a tribe. The following pie charts are normalized to account for Mayweather's larger audience size. Boxing tribe High-affinity accounts in the boxing tribe: Share of audience within the boxing tribe: Business tribe High-affinity accounts in the business tribe: Share of audience within the business tribe: Rap fan tribe High-affinity accounts in the business tribe: Share of audience within the rap fan tribe: Filipino fan tribe High-affinity accounts in the Filipino fan tribe: Share of audience within the Filipino fan tribe: MMA fan tribe High-affinity accounts in the MMA fan tribe: Share of audience within the MMA fan tribe: Relative to the audience size a significant percentage of Boxers follow Pacquiao over Mayweather suggesting that he's more of a "fighter's fighter" - while MMA fighters seem to be equally interested in both. Pacquiao and Mayweather not surprisingly both have support in their home countries but it's the larger American audience that will be the driving force behind the pay-per-view revenue. Every American based tribe (including the rap fans and business professionals) are far more interested in Mayweather than they are Pacquiao which could further justify that he's the one bringing in the majority of the revenue for the fight of the century. Regardless of who wins it's clear that Mayweather is the main attracting for the vast majority of non-fight fans in America.,Brian,April 30 2015
,75,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,75,http://www.affinio.com/blog/mentions-vs-network-whats-the-best-way-to-understand-an-audience,Mentions vs Network - What's the best way to understand an audience?,A common misconception when it comes to understanding a social audience with listening tools is that a group of people who all mention the same topic share the same interest. At Affinio we believe the best way to understand an audience is through the analysis of the network connections between audience members. To illustrate why network connections are so important we ran a tests to show how the difference between people who mention a term people who live in the same location and people who are all connected to a certain account. The colored clusters represent groups of like-minded people inside an audience and the lines between them represent the affinity between those people. The darker and more dense the lines the higher affinity between groups. Example 1: People who mention the same hashtag. (Data from the 20000 people who mentioned #BellLetsTalk earlier this week) As the diagram below shows talking about a given topic doesn't define the user or their psychographic profile; often it's a false flag especially when compared to their profile text or influencers. Example 2: People who live in the same region. (208000 people with "Washington DC" in their bio) Common profile information like location or keywords in bio seem to be a stronger indicator than tweet content but not as strong as common influencers in determining a social group's connectivity. This scales with the size of the community in question: the interconnectedness of nearby a nearby suburb might be higher than a large metro area like Washington simply because in a smaller town the likelihood of knowing your neighbors goes up. Example 3: People who follow the same account. (Data from the 1.6M people who follow World Wildlife Fund @WWF) Here you can see a extremely connected community - at a minimum we could expect that everybody here follows @WWF on twitter. What we found is that this binding factor their common follow leads to lots of other interconnectivity: similar interests in conservation efforts musicians and movie stars who have donated to the cause philanthropically and people generally interested in charity. We hang our hat on the idea that our relationships are more meaningful when we have common interests - we think that common interests trump regional proximity and even common awareness of current events when it comes to saying that a relationship is meaningful. Think about your own circle of followed accounts on Twitter friends on Facebook or even the people you consider yourself to have close relationships with offline. You don't necessarily need to have the same opinions about a topic or live in the same place to be friends or have a meaningful relationship. Instead there is generally a shared interest that makes that other person stand out as someone whose connection you value. Request a demo,Brian,February 05 2015

At the core of WOM marketing is influencer marketing - the act of finding and empowering people who have influence over potential customers to share your product with their audience. While strategies on how to best use these influencers vary depending on the channels audience and goal of the campaign one challenge remains constant: Who influences our potential customers the most and how do we find and quantify them? Thankfully Affinio is here to help. As the leading platform in segmentation and influencer identification we can drill down to your ideal customer then find you all the brands bloggers websites celebrities and internet stars that have the highest influence over them. Unlike Klout or other influencer tools we find influencers only relevant to the target audience you've selected. Example: Top 100 Influencers of interior designers who follow Knoll on Pinterest.

,79,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,79,http://www.affinio.com/blog/quantifiable-data-for-your-sponsorship-deals,Quantifiable Data for Your Sponsorship Deals,Sponsorships and endorsements is a massive market encompassing Billions of dollars in advertising spend worldwide each year. The projected numbers for the sports industry is a $14.98B spend and $2.1B for entertainment. According to IEG sponsorship is a “cash and/or in-kind fee paid to a property in return for access to the exploitable commercial potential associated with that property”. With the continuous growth of mobile and social technologies corporate partners are looking to become an integral part of the rightsholder's digital strategy. However to do so in a seamless way and maximize the benefit of the corporate partner’s investment requires the rightsholder to have a deep understanding of their digital audience and knowing what sponsor content to share with them that will be meaningful authentic and engaging. With so much money being spent on this advertising strategy corporate sponsors are placing the onus on the rightsholders to establish that they: 1) Have the audience that the corporate sponsors want access to and 2) Can reach this audience through multiple channels and 2) Can drive the right message to maximize the corporate partner’s ROI. Social conversation data has been used to quantify sponsorship opportunities however this data represents only a small portion of a rightholder’s social audience (since only 10-20% of any social audience “says” anything and even fewer use the key terms in their tweets that existing tools are listening for). Unlike social listening technologies Affinio mines billions of social accounts and analyzes the underlying social network graph to: Analyze 100% of an audience (even the ones who don’t tweet) to identify naturally-forming communities (or “tribes”) of people with similar interests and affinities Discover the brands that have highest affinities to these communities and Uncover the content that is being shared inside these communities This allows the sales team inside the rightsholders to quickly identify the brands they should approach for sponsorship deals with quantifiable data around the affinity between their properties and the corporate partner using insights that can guide the strategy around promotions that will resonate with these audiences. How does it work? Given that sports represent the largest segment for sponsorship investments we decided to analyze the Miami Dolphins Twitter audience as an example. To start we input the Dolphin’s Twitter handle as our input (453197 Followers) and launched the analysis. This takes about an hour to run. The Affinio engine then segments this social audience into its naturally forming “tribes”. In this case there were 14 tribes identified Then by clicking on any of these tribes we can quickly identify the highest affinity brand accounts to this audience segment Digging into our “Content” tab allows us to quickly identify the type of media that is being shared within this community which can help guide the promotional strategy of the corporate sponsor. All of this is easily exportable to provide the rightsholder’s sales team with the quantifiable data to close more deals faster. Want to learn more request a demo now.,Tim Burke,July 30 2015
,80,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,80,http://www.affinio.com/blog/heart-month-deep-insights-into-the-ahas-audience,Heart Month - Deep insights into the AHA's audience,Earlier this year President Obama declared February as American Heart Month kickstarting the annual awareness campaign against Heart Disease and Stroke. As the federal declaration states “cardiovascular disease — including heart disease stroke and high blood pressure — is responsible for one out of every three deaths. It is the No. 1 killer of American women and men and it is a leading cause of serious illness and disability.” The AHA has several causes to support including: Go Red For Women Go Red Por Tu Corazón My Heart My Life Power To End Stroke Click here to volunteer and here to donate. If you are a fellow Canadian head over to the Heart & Stroke Foundation to do the same. We thought it would be interesting to analyze the AHA's audience over the month of February to see who was participating in the fight. To start let's take a look at @American_Heart Network Graph of 159k followers: A lot of these tribes are what you may expect to find. What I found quite interesting was a dense tribe of personal trainers. Let's dive deeper into this community. The 'Personal Trainer' tribe is: 58 times more likely to self-describe as "Fitness" 51 times more likely to self-describe as "Trainer" 29 times more likely to self-describe as "Personal" The following are the top bio keywords the members of this tribe use to self-describe: Let's find out more about what makes this tribe tick. Here are the top hashtags (left) and mentions (right) used by this tribe over the past 30 days. Now let's look at who influences this tribe. The following is a list of people that the members of this tribe are most likely to follow or have affinities to (click the image to download the full list): You can see that a fair amount of this list would likely be influencers of many people who are in the health profession. So let's look at the top 10 unique influencers to this tribe: PopSugar Fitness Jillian Michaels Men's Fitness Bob Harper Muscle & Fitness FitFluential Fit Bottomed Girls Active.com Muscle & Fitness Hers ACE Fitness Finally here are the top domains that the 'Personal Trainers' tribe uses to source information: I hope you found this interesting!

,82,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,82,http://www.affinio.com/blog/influencer-marketing-is-dead-or-is-it,Influencer Marketing is Dead Or is It?,Ok. So influencer marketing isn’t dead...but the way in which influencer marketing is being done now is about to die. The concept of influencer marketing is nothing new. Celebrities and high-profile individuals have been recruited for ad campaigns to influence buyer decisions for years. With the emergence of social media the availability of social media “celebs” has exploded. Instead of being restricted to sports celebs actors and famous musicians brands now have the ability to reach their target audiences through a host of possible social media influencers who in and of themselves are media channels. As a result there has also been an explosion of influencer “platforms” and “marketplaces” around the world aggregating massive social media influencers and trying to match brands with these influencers. However there is a problem. The definitions of an influencer and selection of the appropriate influencers for campaigns is based on antiquated vanity metrics. Number of followers number of likes / RTs number of posts/year Klout score etc. Most agencies get a basic description of the audience they are looking to target based on generic demographic / psychographic data. The agencies then proceed to take in most cases their best guess of which influencers or talent would have these matching target audiences as followers manually searching databases and trying to build evidence and cases why their influencers are the “right” ones for a given brand and campaign. Often the “proof” is a matter of showing the brand how an influencer self-describes a few sample posts and a snippet of the type of people following the influencer. This data is weak! In a world where terabytes of data can be analyzed in fractions of a second brands are still relying on human analysis and selection for these kinds of decisions. Really!? Millions are being spent on these campaigns with little to no quantifiable data with the hope that the agency made the right decision. Content is being created and shared through these influencers without knowing in advance if it will resonate with their audiences. To boot the performance of these campaigns are assessed using the same antiquated metrics that were used to select the influencer in the first place. Total reach total impressions total favorites/RT/likes total comments etc. Nothing to prove or disprove that the content reached the target audience. It's all smoke and mirrors. With the power of big data and the massive data sets available in social these kinds of influencer campaigns are dead and so too are the human-based powered influencer marketplaces. Just as programmatic has changed ad buying - so too will technology in the influencer marketplaces. Here’s why this has to happen - smart brands are demanding transparency. They are pushing their digital agencies to prove that their influencer selection drove content to the target audiences they wanted and performed well. This is an ROI game. No more “spray-n-pray” - this is about efficiency and effectiveness...not vanity. The data exists to pick the perfect influencer to reach the right audience with the right content. What’s been lacking is the technology and tools to make this happen. This technology and all future influencer strategies need to be audience-centric not influencer-centric. We have to assess influencers not on vanity metrics but with full transparency into the specific segments in their social audiences. With technologies like Affinio this is now possible and changes the game. How? Brands Can Easily Discover the Target Audience They Want: Gone are the days of a white board and fabricated personas that get cast into generic demographic / psychographic details. With technology like Affinio brands can easily discover naturally-forming segments (we call them “tribes”) in social networks that they want to target with their campaigns. Brands can Automatically Find the Right Influencers: By leveraging the social graph and knowing what the members of this target audience are following brands can quickly identify the highest affinity and relevant influencers to use to reach their target audience. Brands can Create the Best Content: Brands can easily leverage what is currently being shared and consumed in these social “tribes” to guide their content creation so they know their message content and medium will resonate with their target audience. With an audience-centric approach brands can have full transparency and confidence in their selection of influencers for their next campaign and can assess the performance based on real target audience metrics. And one last word - for those influencers out there who have bought followers and cheated the vanity-based system to drive up their perceived value in this non-transparent influencer marketplace...I’m sorry but with our tech your days of getting paid are numbered too.,Tim Burke,December 09 2015

Brands have been taught to use social in a very prescriptive way: Step 1: Listen to who is mentioning your brand on social Step 2: Engage with these people Step 3: Create and publish content Many brands believe that if done correctly “magic” happens and these 'engagers' become customers and brand advocates. However there has been increasing questions about the ROI of social. Brands continue investing millions of dollars in social strategies and some are questioning if they are generating positive returns. They engage with thousands to millions of people every year but how many of them are existing customers? Or will become customers? Or even fit the profile of an ideal customer? We believe that the issues of many brand’s social strategies are tied to the underlying assumptions that brands have been sold on for years namely: People who engage with your brand = your ideal customers Engagers are the only “valuable” members of social networks These assumptions are simply wrong. First people who engage with a brand are often not customers not qualified to become customers and don’t even fit the persona of a customer. Brands have invested in the development of building targeted personas but listening / engagement strategies provide no way to map these personas to social profiles. So brands continue to spend money engaging with these people because they have no way of establishing if these random people fit the profile of their customers or not. Second there is a lack of visibility into the network connectivity between people on social the communities they belong to and how they are influencing one another. The greatest value behind social networks the network itself has been dominantly ignored in social technologies overshadowed by engagement and vanity metrics. This is where social technologies have failed brands and where we see the opportunity for the foundation of evolved brand strategy on social. We believe: Social strategy should be based on active targeting not passive listening Tweet this The greatest value of social networks is the network itself Ideal customers are ON social but may not BE social (80 - 90% of people on social “say” nothing let alone mention your brand!) How can a brand leverage Affinio’s affinity technology to transform its social strategy and improve ROI? Audit your Social Audience: who is your brand currently attracting? What communities do they belong to? Who do they share common affinities / interests with? What are their social personas? Do they fit your ideal customer? We’ve written about how to create these social personas here Stop Listening and Start Targeting: find the high-affinity communities (we call them “tribes”) on social that match your ideal customer define the total addressable market (we can help you do this) and go after them with unified paid-owned-earned campaigns (we’ll show you how in our next post). Tie KPIs to ROI: Drop the vanity metrics! Who cares if you have 100000 more followers if they will never be customers? Develop KPIs that assess your social strategy against ONLY your target communities. How many of your target audience did you get to the top of your funnel and ultimately how many of them converted? We’re building businesses - this is the ultimate ROI metric. Welcome to Social 2.0. Ready to transform your brand’s social strategy?,Tim Burke,July 29 2015

,88,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,88,http://www.affinio.com/blog/using-social-data-to-understand-betting-customers,Using Social Data To Understand Betting Customers,The gaming and gambling industry has always had one key problem when it came to social media marketing - relevancy. Most people are quite particular in what they bet on. They tend to stick to what they know or what they are passionate about. How do you balance brand building with relevance in your social marketing? Betting firms believe in social and content marketing they invest heavily in it and some of the best social marketers in the world are to be found in the Gaming industry. Paddy Power are probably one of the best brand builders in the business when it comes to Social. But no matter how good you are at creating engagement you still have some fundamental problems. 1. How do you know the composition of your audience? Your brand is relevant to a wide variety of consumers who follow very different sports and are very different in terms of what they like how they communicate and what they are interested in. Take a look at the variety found in a fraction of @Coral’s graph Affinio found over 14 separate tribes in @Coral’s followers from as diverse affinities as WWE wrestling to Cricket fans. These tribes will respond to different messaging at different times in different ways. Without Affinio the vast majority of these tribes would go unnoticed. On average 82% of @Coral’s audience are lurkers who are not tweeting. So to the rest of the social listening technologies they simply do not exist. But gamblers use Twitter and other social media for tips and news and do not necessarily share especially if they find usable information. This silent majority is now illuminated and can now be reached. 2. What content are they engaging with? You can see from the report here that overall the most favorited Tweet for this audience was: One last dream in my career come true. I am excited about the next chapter in my life with @ManUtd. pic.twitter.com/aWnz9mnuD8 — Basti Schweinsteiger (@BSchweinsteiger) July 12 2015 But when you delve into two of the tribes to compare (Soccer AM Fans and Horseracing Fans) you can see the massive difference in what these two separate audiences follow and engage with: Soccer AM Fans Top 100 Most Relevant Accounts Top 5 Favourited Tweets One last dream in my career come true.

So how to become more relevant? Using the Affinio platform a betting client can now start to market specifically to the right people and to the right type of people. Using our Ad Platform Betting Clients can now bridge the gap between Engagement and Acquisition by fine-tuning their Twitter ads to a specific Tribe or Audience type. Affinio allows clients to base lookalike audiences on their tribe segmentations. Armed with the insights on each tribes content and engagement habits the social marketer can now gain the insight to build the right content for the right audience and market to them using one platform Affinio. The gambling industry has been one of the pioneers of social marketing. Audience affinities are seldom stronger than seen in the social followings of this industry’s biggest players. The tribal essence of sports and sports teams is a fundamental part of our society and people really do wear their hearts on their sleeves when it comes to their sports passions. Affinio helps to draw out and illuminate the silent majority of these people. It allows brands to see who they are and what they like. More importantly it allows brands to speak directly to each tribe. Engaging them in what they want to hear rather than what the brand wants to tell them.,Philip Macartney,August 20 2015
,89,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,89,http://www.affinio.com/blog/what-macys-and-the-wwe-have-in-common,What Macy's and the WWE Have in Common,You may think you know who your audience is but let me tell you there IS a difference between what you set your target market to be and what your audience really is. While you may be targeting to a certain demographic sometimes within your audience there is a tribe of people that you least expected. Last month with the highly anticipated release of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' we conducted an analysis in which we found that 35% of the audience were made up of young women and teenage girls - an audience we weren't expecting to see. This got us excited to explore other brands to see what else we could find. The analysis we conducted on Macy's really drives home the point that the marketing efforts you pursue over time influence what your audience looks like. Here is an overview of the tribes we found in the Macy's audience of ~760K followers: A number of these tribes are what we would expect to see: fashionistas beauty/makeup followers and moms. What I found intriguing is the small but mighty tribe of WWE followers. When I initially saw this I thought "really? WWE and Macy's? How is there overlap here?" Before jumping to why there is a WWE tribe in the Macy's audience I first wanted to explore an expected tribe Fashionistas compared to the WWE tribe. The 'Fashionistas' tribe is: 325x more likely to self-describe as "accessories" 283x more likely to self-describe as "fashion" 278x more likely to self-describe as "style" 201x more likely to self-describe as "jewelry" 190x more likely to self-describe as "designer" Let's dig deeper and see what content is really resonating with this tribe. Here you can see the top hashtags (left) and top mentions (right) that this tribe of people use: Here are the influencers for the 'Fashionistas' tribe: The top 10 unique influencers to this tribe are: Business of Fashion Stella McCartney V Magazine DVF Alexander Wang Times Fashion Net-a-Porter New York Times Styles The Council of Fashion Designers of America London Fashion Week Finally here is some of the most-liked content by the 'Fashionistas' tribe: Now let's look at the 'WWE' tribe. This tribe is: 8607x more likely to self-describe as "wwe" Here's what that looks like: You can see the top hashtags (left) and top mentions (right) - clearly much different than the 'Fashionistas' Tribe. These are the influencers for the 'WWE' tribe. This tribe has a lot more 'unique influencers' than the 'Fashionistas' tribe does. The top ten unique influencers for the 'WWE' tribe are: Daniel Bryan Dolph Ziggler Nikki & Brie Big Show A.J. Chris Jericho WWE Sheamus Shawn Michaels Nattie WWE R-Truth Here's a sample of what content resonates the best with them: Now the burning question: why does Macy's audience have a 'WWE' tribe? Where is this relationship coming from? For the past 7 years Macy's has teamed up with Make-a-Wish America for National Believe Day. The event happens annually where the Macy's and Make-a-Wish work together to make wishes come true for 50 children in the US. In late 2014 one boy's wish was to meet WWE star John Cena and before he knew it he found himself in St. Louis meeting Cena thanks to Macy's and Make-a-Wish America. Back in May 2013 WWE and the Children's Wish Foundation International teamed up to make a little girl's dream come true by inviting her to a live WWE Monday Night RAW event. These aren't the only two instances that Cena has helped make wishes come true. Cena has reportedly helped make over 400 children's wishes come true. This year's National Believe day is happening on December 12 2015 and if you're interested in donating to the cause click here. There are no efforts that are too little or too large. Not only is it amazing to see Macy's team up with a great charitable cause but we speculate that their efforts have generated enough buzz to attract a tribe of people they aren't actively targeting - the WWE tribe.

,91,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,91,http://www.affinio.com/blog/making-your-brand-a-trusted-community-member,Making your brand a trusted community member,Humans are naturally social beings. We like the feeling of being a part of a community. Whether on the playground at a church in the locker room or in our neighborhoods we naturally strive to surround ourselves with others who share our interests beliefs passions and aspirations. When we feel a sense of community we trust one another and share openly with others. We all know that “birds of a feather flock together”. These “flocks” exist in person and within social networks. As humans we seek out and associate with others who are “like” us online and in person. Communities on social networks are self-assembling groups of individuals who all share similar interests passions and aspirations. This has major implications for digital strategists marketers and social advertisers. If you can accurately find these communities of like-minded people and you can identify what they care about what they share and what content they absorb you can develop very targeted content and ad strategies to engage with them. More importantly the goal is to have your brand become part of this community. Not just an outsider and not just an advertiser but rather a valuable trusted member and thought leader. Social networks provide the framework for this to become reality but achieving this goal for a brand is a challenging task. Traditionally the challenge has been finding these tight communities on social networks. Most strategists and marketers are forced to use search engines or basic search functionality within these networks to find key influencers and try to “piece” together the community based on who is following these perceived influencers. This method lacks efficiency and accuracy typically resulting in marketing and advertising efforts that lack quantifiable results and KPIs that don’t get satisfied. This is where Affinio comes in. Our advanced social affinity engine analyzes social graphs to automatically identify highly connected communities with similar interests passions behaviors and aspirations. Not only can we detect these target communities but we also identify what they are talking about what they are sharing who they are influenced by and what they care about. This provides deep social insights to power amazing strategies that enable brands to weave themselves into the passion areas of their target communities by support the causes that mean the most to them sharing content that they know will resonate and provide thought leadership as a trusted community member.

To better understand the various types of people interested in the Cannes Lions we segmented the 150942 people who follow @cannes_lions on Twitter into niche tribes based on their interests and affinities. Here’s what we found: As you can see in the network graphic above the Cannes Lions social audience is made up entirely of creatives from around the world. Another thing that caught our attention is the fact that this audience is lacking a "general" tribe - or a group of people who didn't fit neatly into the tribes our algorithm found. When analyzing social audiences we usually find that 10-20% of an audience is made up of accounts that don't fit well within the niche tribes found so they form their own tribe of misfits that we usually name "general". Despite being an audience comprised entirely of creatives Affinio was still able to sub-segment this creative heavy audience into specific niches allowing for a much more detailed analysis of the various subgenres of creatives within the Cannes Lions audience. Rather than simply identifying creatives in Europe Affinio was able to analyze the psychographic profiles of each audience member and segment Europe into 3 distinct groups consisting of fashion and film design and agency creatives. Top 100 accounts for European Film and Fashion: Top 100 accounts for European Designers: Top 100 accounts for European Creatives: In addition to finding the accounts that matter most to European Creatives we also extracted deep insights on who these users were and the content and domains that matter most to them. As an example here's what's hot in the European Design community: How European Design tribe members self-describe: Top used hashtags by European Design tribe members: Top mentioned accounts by European Design tribe members: Top tweets favorited by European Design tribe members: Material Design is the best marketing campaign for a design team I've ever seen.

MillerCoors CMO David Kroll believes that Coors Light has taken a “too TV-centric approach” and he also added that “the way consumers are interacting with brands is changing literally by the minute” - quotes that suggest that MillerCoors is looking for their new agency to take a more interactive social media-based approach. Mr. Kroll also stated that the brewer is "well behind the curve in really engaging drinkers in that unplugged world and must find ways to connect with them in a way that is relevant to their lifestyle." To help MillerCoors as well as the three mystery agencies in the running for the work understand the lifestyle and online habits of the various Coors Light audience segments we used Affinio to segment the Twitter and Instagram accounts of Coors Light.

In this example Affinio's algorithms found a tribe of Hunters and Fishers and provided deep psychographic and cultural insights into who they are and what they care about most. You can see that they are southern & midwestern hunters and fishers who really enjoy Duck Dynasty and other country & hunting related accounts. They are also very patriotic and politically conservative - the USA flag was the top used emoji and this was the only tribe in the Coors audience where this was true. Moving forward both Coors Light and their new agency will need to understand the many tribes hidden within their social audiences if they are to truly understand and connect with their customers in real-time.,Brian,August 10 2015

The service will pay artists double the going streaming rate and deliver “Hi-Fi” music to subscribers for $19.99 /mo. Despite their artist's first approach it's launch has been met with a wave of negative feedback and press: How Jay Z’s Tidal press conference showed he’s out of touch http://t.co/NlANLibUW1 — TIME.com (@TIME) March 31 2015 Please help these starving artists. #TIDALforALL pic.twitter.com/N8VWlGXU9x — Funny Tweets (@JokesByScotty) March 31 2015 The most pretentious lines from the launch of #TIDALforALL http://t.co/dwvU2OcLgo pic.twitter.com/2SCERzlsS7 — The Independent (@Independent) March 31 2015 That’s it. It’s all over. Tidal wins April Fools 2015. Pixel-for-pixel rip of Spotify’s design for 2x the price. Nicely done music elites! — Zach Holman (@holman) March 31 2015 "How much they hate it? very! ... They just haters I wave at you I’m so player I’ll never be done I’m so rare" - Jay Z + Kanye West (Hate) Now it’s easy to write off the team behind TIDAL as a bunch of spoiled artists trying to get more money but the reality is they are the ones making the content so why shouldn’t they benefit from it by controlling distribution? The TIDAL team has the breadth and depth needed to appeal to a wide audience and become the go to place for the hottest music today and in the future. As part of their launch they requested that all supporters change their profile pictures to this shade of cyan: To better understand TIDAL's early traction and the spread of their support I used Affinio to segment and analyze the XXX people following @TIDALHiFi to better understand the different customer personas they are attracting. Here’s what I found: Tribes within the audience of TIDAL on Twitter: Most Influential/high affinity accounts to the followers of TIDAL on Twitter: Influencers of the members of the Hardcore Beyonce fans Tribe: The image above clearly shows that Beyonce fans are being flooded with TIDAL related content. Beyonce’s network is supporting her by changing their profile picture and pushing TIDAL content to ensure her hardcore fanbase know all about the product. Influencers of the members of the Hardcore Nicki Minaj fans Tribe: Nicki’s network is also showing an extremely high level of support for TIDAL. It’s clear that these two superstars have loyal fan bases and like Kanye's interest in Karmaloop  are trying to find a way to convert and monetize this audience. Other tribes notably the Rock fan and Film fan tribes aren’t seeing the same level of TIDAL support from the influential accounts in their niche. Influencers of the members of the Rock fans tribe: While these influential rock related accounts aren’t going out of their way to support TIDAL the members of these tribes are still taking notice of the service. Film and Rock fans make up 13% of TIDALS twitter following and TIDAL is one of the top favourited topics within this group. Affinio extracts the most favourited tweets by members of a tribes so I was able to find these two tweets by Jay Z and Kanye at the top of both the Rock fan and Film fan tribes: "The Tides They Are-A Changing" #TIDALforALL — Mr. Carter (@S_C_) March 30 2015 The love of music is louder than words. In five hours history will be made @TIDALHiFi. http://t.co/5BZivtBxKv #TIDALforALL — KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 30 2015 Based on these insights it's clear that the artists behind TIDAL are flooding their fans with TIDAL related content and their audiences are responding to it. #TIDALForAll is trending on Twitter and @TIDALHiFi has gained over 20000 followers in the past day. While the press conference may have been out to lunch the power of these stars and their influence shows that while critics may think the newly acquired music streaming platform is stupid and doomed to fail the audiences of the stars involved are jumping on board and eating it up.

,99,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,99,http://www.affinio.com/blog/everyone-loves-an-underdog-biosteel-shows-major-sponsorship-deals-arent-always-the-answer,Everyone Loves an Underdog: BioSteel Shows Major Sponsorship Deals Aren't Always the Answer,The business of sports is one of the largest markets worldwide and the brands and agencies that lead this market are some of the overall largest in the world. With brand names such as Nike Adidas Gatorade Under Armour and Powerade owning a lot of the spotlight and consumer interest it’s difficult for smaller companies and corporations to gain attention and find their own spot in the business of sports. That’s why at times when smaller sports related brands are found defying the odds it’s interesting to research further into how they are managing to hold their own and finding ways to not be overshadowed by these other massive companies. Biosteel is a Canadian line of nutrition supplements for athletes with the main products being it’s sport drink and proteins. In 2009 strength coach and trainer Matt Nichol the original creator of the drink met John Celenza and BioSteel was created. Celenza and Nichol pride themselves on their business strategy of professional athletes using their product out of pure enjoyment rather than paying substantial amounts of money for traditional ad campaigns with these players *cough* Gatorade and Powerade *cough*. Celenza states that they pay a “miniscule amount” for the athletes using BioSteel and it’s usually just for appearances. For example the one NFL player on the BioSteel team is Dez Bryant and according to Celenza and Nichol they don’t pay Bryant a cent to be seen walking into stadiums “drinking the pink” on game days. This is a very interesting way of promoting a business especially when competing with powerhouses such as Gatorade and Powerade. By using Affinio’s algorithms we can see that this way seems to not only be working but working very effectively and efficiently. As you can see in the report of all the Twitter followers of @BioSteelSports many distinct tribes surfaced. Despite having a much smaller Twitter audience than Gatorade or Powerade (BioSteel with 30.1k Twitter followers Gatorade with 324k and Powerade with 151k) and not to mention a substantially smaller list of endorsed athletes there are still niche tribes and audiences that can be found with their attention on BioSteel. Dez Bryant is the only NFL player currently with BioSteel and that's all this company seems to need at least as a start towards penetrating audiences in football as a Dallas Cowboy/NFL fan tribe is clearly found in the graph. Carey Price and Tyler Seguin are the only two NHL players endorsed by BioSteel however tribes of Canadiens Fans General Hockey Fans and NHL Fans are easily found in BioSteel’s followers on Twitter as well. Also BioSteel has Jordan Spieth as their only endorsed golfer and once again a very distinct tribe can be found solely based on Spieth's sport. In addition when we looked more specifically into what these followers interests are and what they have been sharing the majority of content was material that any sports based company would most definitely be looking to be related to in the eyes of consumers. Top 100 Interests Hashtags Mentions When you’re a small player in a field of much larger brands efficiency is absolutely key and making the most out of every dollar is very important. Investigating BioSteel’s followers using Affinio the efficiency that this company is working with and required to have is easily shown. As said earlier with a Twitter audience one tenth of the size of Gatorade's and around one third of Powerade's a lower number of endorsed athletes and considerably lower amounts being paid for these athletes (compared to Gatorade or Powerade) niche tribes and groups based around sports and fitness are still very distinctive formed from the followers of BioSteel. Perhaps Nichol and Celenza’s new kind of business strategy is more effective than some may think it seems as though the fact that these athletes are with BioSteel simply due to their authentic enjoyment of the product is compelling to consumers. Gatorade and Powerade should keep their eyes on this slow rolling machine because if BioSteel continues to gain athletes and player association licenses they could begin to do some serious damage to the overall space in sports business.,Jacob Burke,August 11 2015

,102,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,102,http://www.affinio.com/blog/save-the-bees-the-affinio-guide-to-beekeeping,Save the Bees - Affinio's data-driven guide to beekeeping,We have a few employees at the Affinio office who love using natural products so when we found out that the founder of Burt's Bees Burt Shavitz passed away at the age of 80 we were curious to understand and explore who else used the products we've grown to love. To start we analyzed the followers of @burtsbees on Twitter and found a variety of persona's with the audience. The most compelling to us though was a niche tribe within the audience that consisted of Beekeepers. With the lovers and caretakers of bees in mind we thought it would be fitting to use Affinio to extract insights from the leaders of beekeeping to develop a guide that surfaces the most relevant accounts and content that are leading the charge to help protect our rapidly declining bee populations. This beekeeping tribe consisted of 1407 people and we instantly knew they were beekeepers because of how they self-described: To ensure we were learning from as many beekeepers as possible we used our lookalike modelling to find everyone else on Twitter who shared the same interests affinities and relational connections as these beekeepers. Once complete our lookalike modelling found a total of 4326 people on Twitter with high affinity to beekeeping and digging into this larger tribe of beekeepers allowed us to uncover the top accounts and content that mattered most to beekeepers on Twitter. With this information in hand it was easy to compile the following list of top 10 bee-related accounts and shared content. Top shared links by Beekeepers on Twitter: New Winnie-the-Pooh story: In which Pooh and Piglet save the bees Bees feeding on fungicide-dosed flowers develop health issues studies say Friends of the Honey Bee - Friends of the Honey Bee The truth about bees Protect our bees from pesticides PHOTOS AND FACTS: What You Can Learn from the White House Honeybees Bees contribute more to British economy than Royal Family How can we help the bees?

,103,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,103,http://www.affinio.com/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis-using-social-data,How to Conduct a Competitive Analysis Using Social Data,In a world where many market structures are perfect competition it is important for companies to understand how they perform against their competitors in order to sustain or improve their competitive advantage. Of course this can be done in terms of market share value and revenues but it's no doubt that social media has changed the game over the last decade or so. With billions of active social media users around the world it is important for companies to understand the social data behind how you compare to your competitors. With winter around the corner (or here in some places) and myself being on the online hunt for deals on winter outerwear I was curious to see how Recreational Equipment Inc. (@REI) and Dick's Sporting Goods (@DICKS) stood against each other. This was possible using the Affinio platform. Creating a report to include Competitors On the Affinio platform when you input 2-12 handles you'll have access to competitive information on who 'owns' each tribe. I simply ran a Twitter network graph report on all of those who follow @REI and @DICKS. (To learn more about how to create an Affinio report check out our Report Builder Tutorial). The users who follow @REI and also @DICKS were segmented into niche tribes based on their interests and affinities as seen in the graph below. To learn more about creating data-driven personas check out our detailed blog post. Audience details: @REI: 308k followers @DICKS: 380k followers Total # of users analyzed: 676k Which brand 'owns' each tribe? Using the 'Competitive' tab in the Affinio platform you can understand what percentage of a tribe you hold over your competitors. Here are a few sample tribes with competitive information between @REI and @DICKS. Skiiers/Snowboarders Tribe Marathoners/Triathletes Tribe Hunting/Fishing Tribe WWE/Gamers Tribe Tying it together This competitive information tells us which audience segments a brand or company 'owns'. But not only that it also helps to identify new market opportunities you didn't know existed. If I were a marketer for Dick's Sporting Goods for example I would strategize to win over the 'Marathoners/Triathletes' tribe. Considering that many of the products that Dick's sells are directly related to runners or triathletes it's smart for the company to try to gain more of this market. To do this Dick's would need to understand who this tribe is and what they care about.

Our strata award winning technology segments audiences into distinct niche personas and provides deep insights into who these people are and what they care about most. How our audience segmentation works: This is your audience: This is their network: This is what they talk about: This is what Affinio's community detection does: Insights provided for each niche community: Once we break an audience into unique personas we then present the following in a highly visual dashboard complete with .csv exports: · Size of niche communities · Percentage of audience ownership in a niche (great for competitive intelligence) · Level of interconnectivity of the users in the community · How similar the people in a community are to one another · Most influential accounts to people in a niche community · Most used keywords hashtags and mentioned accounts · Locations of the people inside the community · Devices people use (iPhone Android Web etc) · Top shared links · Top shared photos · Top shared videos Applications for these insights: 1. Win new business Win business by knowing the most about a brands audience. We currently have agencies winning new business building their pitch decks and RFP's around our in depth persona insights.

The College Bowl Games are played in December and January of each year and have become a staple event for any college football fan. Forty different Bowl Games are planned for December and into January 2016 and will be played between different college football teams from across the US. The most commonly known matchups are played on New Year’s Day and include the Allstate SugarBowl the BattleFrog Fiesta Bowl and the Northwestern Mutual Rose Bowl. The audience sizes are nothing short of impressive. Last year’s Bowl Games on Jan. 1 2015 attracted between 10 to 28 million viewers. With such large viewership that is increasing year after year the Bowl Games present an attractive advertising and sponsorship opportunity for many brands and businesses. In a Forbes article published last December (“Are College Football Bowl Game Naming Rights Deals Providing A Real Return On Investment?”) Sports Attorney Darren Heitner outlined a number of uncertainties regarding the ROI brands are achieving when sponsoring Bowl Games. This article inspired us to run a deeper analysis of the current 2016 Bowl Games sponsors. We wanted to take a high-level look at the brands that are currently advertising with the Bowl Games (e.g. Allstate) to see how well their investments are performing in terms of brand recognition. We also wanted to uncover if there are brands that are not currently advertising at the Bowl Games but should consider doing so in the new year. We chose to run an analysis on the Twitter audiences of the Allstate Sugar Bowl the Northwestern Mutual Rose Bowl and the BattleFrog Fiesta Bowl. All three of these games are played on Jan 1. each year and have some of the highest viewership ratings out of all of the Bowl Games. By analyzing each Twitter following we were able to identify five of the highest ranked affinity brands for each Bowl Game. Allstate Sugar Bowl Northwestern Mutual Rose Bowl BattleFrog Fiesta Bowl The results that were found are rather interesting. Each of the primary sponsors (Allstate Northwestern Mutual and BattleFrog) were not found in the highest ranked affinity brands for any of the Bowl Games. Instead a number of other brands showed up: Allstate Sugar Bowl Buffalo Wild Wings (349) Chick-fil-A (381) Subway (390) Dick's Sporting Goods (416) Southwest Airlines (451) Northwestern Mutual Rose Bowl Vudu (198) Subway (247) Buffalo Wild Wings (292) Southwest Airlines (366) Amazon (371) BattleFrog Fiesta Bowl Southwest Airlines (156) Subway (315) Buffalo Wild Wings (357) McDonald’s (451) Gatorade (462) This was surprising to say the least brands such as BattleFrog Northwestern Mutual and Allstate are said to be signing contracts north of $25 million to become the primary sponsor of these New Year’s Day Bowl Games. As Darren Heitner outlined given the upfront investment to become a game sponsor how strong is their ROI? On the other hand there are brands (shown above) that seem to be gaining the recognition and attention from the Bowl Game's audiences. Three brands in particular that stood out and made all three lists are Buffalo Wild Wings Subway and Southwest Airlines. This means that these brands are highly relevant to the Bowl Game audience(s) and therefore would have good reason to seek out advertising and or sponsorship opportunities based on audience affinity alone. Taking a deeper dive these brands would be able to use technologies like Affinio to uncover exactly what content would resonate best with the college football fan audience. In conclusion coming back to the questions regarding ROI that Darren Heitner brought up in his Forbes article one could argue that the investment by some brands isn't improving their brand recognition among the college football fan audience. However as shown using Affinio's analysis there are some brands that would be welcomed by college football fans based on their current interests. We're interested to see what brands will be advertising during the games and whether any of the brands we identified as credible sponsors will be present in 2016.

Traditionally demographics were easier to compile (and therefore much more widely used) due to census information and other paper based sources while psychographics due to their detail were much harder to obtain. Demographic information includes the basics: age gender race location and profession. While these insights are important they are difficult to action on due to their cold analytical emotionless nature. Psychographics however focus on the interests affinities and emotions of a group of people - exactly the things marketers need to understand to best position their product. When creating a campaign it’s critical to connect with your customers on a cultural and emotional level to ensure the look feel and tone of your content fits your ideal audience. To illustrate the importance of detailed psychographic data we analyzed a group of Motocross fans that follow @gopro and compiled both demographics vs psychographics profile for them. Below are sample members from the motocross tribe - they were randomly selected and we removed the names and profile photos to protect their identity. Demographics of sample motocross members: Motocross fan 1: Age: 20 Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: Filipino Location: Texas Profession: Boat Mechanic Motocross fan 2: Age: 22 Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity:Hispanic Location: Virginia Profession: Mechanic at U.S. Navy Motocross fan 3: Age: 25 Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: White Location: Washington State Profession: Commercial Pilot Motocross fan 4: Age: 13 Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: White Location: New Mexico Profession: Student Motocross fan 5: Age: 30 Sex: Male Race/Ethnicity: White Location: Arizona Profession: Graphic Designer Motocross fan 6: Age: 27 Sex: Male Ethnicity: Caucasian Location: Arizona Profession: Sales at Goodyear Commercial tire The demographic details above show that these motocross tribe members have little in common other than that they are males and are located in the USA. Their ages locations race/ethnicity professions and buying power all vary and provide little insights into the types of products and content that would resonate with them. Their psychographic profiles however paint a much more detailed picture of who they are and the things they care about most. After reviewing the 8585 people in this tribe we found that they all had high affinity to the same topics and accounts (details shown below) Psychographics of motocross members: Terms tribe members use to describe themselves: Level of shared interests between all the members of this tribe: Accounts with the highest affinity to tribe members: Top used hashtags by tribe members: Locations where tribe members live: Accounts most mentioned by tribe members: Top shared links by tribe members: Erica Enders-Stevens wins RACER of the year CMT Sweepstakes - The Party Down South Season 3 IMSA | TUDOR United SportsCar Championship The XFINITY Series Victory Lane Twitter Sweepstakes NASCAR Sprint Cup series leaderboard Performance Racing Network's at the Track Pirelli World Challenge Racer TV.com Speed stars for second in Miami in surreal different open-wheel experience Kyle Bush Motorsports After comparing the demographic and psychographic profiles of this audience it became clear that an audience's interests transcend demographics. People from all walks of life can share the same passions and interests so it's critical that you dig deep into your audiences psychographics rather than concentrating on age gender location etc. When developing and executing campaigns content messaging and so on - remember that content resonates with people that share the same psychographics not demographics.

Understanding that all networks are not the same and that a users interests can vary between networks is key when developing content and advertising strategies. In a previous post we ran a test comparing the most relevant and high-affinity accounts for people interested in fashion and NASCAR on both Twitter and Instagram to highlight that the exact same people on both networks have different interests and affinities on each. We did this by finding ~20K people who have accounts on both Twitter and Instagram and calculated the most relevant accounts for the same people on both networks to find out what changed. We found that although some of the accounts on Twitter also mattered on Instagram the ranking and strength of their relevance changed between networks. This indicates that you need to develop content and targeting strategies that are unique to each platform as the interests content and discourse between networks is different and they each require their own strategy. To build on this initial research we compiled a list of 18000 comic fans on Twitter who also have accounts on Instagram. We then calculated the most relevant accounts for these people on each network and found that of the top 200 most relevant accounts on Twitter only 89 of them were highly relevant on both Twitter and Instagram. After identifying that 60% of the high-affinity accounts to these users are different on Instagram and Twitter we dug into the profiles and content from these users to better understand how their interests and activities differ between networks. User bio keywords on Twitter: User bio keywords on Instagram: Tweet keywords on Twitter: Image comment keywords on Instagram: Top used hashtags on Twitter: Top used hashtags on Instagram: Top mentioned accounts on Twitter: Top tagged accounts on Instagram: After reviewing the way these users self-describe and act on both Instagram and Twitter it's clear that people use different social networks in different ways.

,108,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,108,http://www.affinio.com/blog/where-did-affinio-come-from,Where Did Affinio Come From?,Our Affinio team consists of many serial entrepreneurs with years of experience working together. The concept for Affinio spun out of our last startup (www.tether.com) over two years ago when at that time we were looking at our ~6000 followers on Twitter and although we were using listening tools to monitor and engage our audience we really had no idea of who our audience really was. So we began with a very simple experiment to find out more about them. We analyzed everything else our followers were following on Twitter. Then we proceeded to aggregate this data and what we discovered blew us away. This was our “a-ha” moment and the impetus for Affinio. It was like a “Marketing Strategy 101” report generated purely based on the affinities of our existing followers. We discovered what they were interested in where they were getting their news who was influencing them what bloggers they were following even which competitors they were following. We quickly realized that: 1) no one in the market seemed to be analyzing social graphs to extract this type of marketing and advertising intel and 2) if our report was that useful for only 6000 followers it would be a game-changer for major global brands. While all other social platforms seemed to be focused on vanity metrics like number of followers likes RT fav and mentions none of them were tapping the wealth of marketing and advertising data that resided inside the social graph itself. These listening tools were also only capturing data on those who were “vocal” in these social networks which is typically only 10-20% of users. What about the 80-90% of the rest of the network? Those who absorb content but don’t create it. They are buyers too - influenced by content and ads yet completed overlooked by listening/sentiment social platforms. Recognizing this major flaw we jumped on this opportunity. We’ve spent the last year and a half building the core “engine” that would power our social graph analytics and insights. In that time we developed a custom NoSQL database that can store and mitigate massive graphs in fractions of a second (and won an award for this and are featured by AWS here). More recently we’ve been focused on adding a machine learning layer based on deep learning over top of our database to begin developing predictive algorithms that will power our next generation of insights. Two years after its inception Affinio is now live! Our focus is on delivering the best insights possible for digital strategists marketers and advertisers alike.

,109,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,109,http://www.affinio.com/blog/the-dirty-secret-that-listening-platforms-dont-want-you-to-know,The dirty secret that listening platforms don't want you to know.,Social listening platforms have been the go to tool for anyone looking to learn about an audience on social media. They allow you to filter through massive amounts of social data to find key topics content or posts. While the ability to filter the internet by keyword is awesome it’s still just a filter. The downside of these tools is that the amount of information they can access and analyze is limited. Roughly ~80% of a social audience is silent so if you rely on listening tools for social insights you’ll only be learning about the most vocal 20% of your audience. Another issue with listening tools is that they are difficult to use and require a training period because they only work if the proper boolean search queries have been input. Once trained you are required to input exactly what you are looking for making it difficult to stumble across and uncover new insights about an audience. What does all of this mean? It means that the data you’ve been collecting and using to guide strategy is only relevant to a small percentage of vocal people in your social audience and you’ve been missing the bigger picture the entire time. What makes Affinio different? The key to understanding an ENTIRE audience lies in the social connections between everyone within the audience. It’s only through analyzing these connections (known as the social graph) can you truly understand the different types of people in a social audience. The challenge with this approach is scale. As an example the social graph of Twitter has over 700 Million people and over 50 Billion connections between them. All existing methods of analysis either took too long cost too much or required us to sample the data so heavily that it was no longer accurate or useful. During our development process Affinio tested every available service and technology and found that the only viable option was to develop our own award winning technology. It’s this breakthrough that allows us to provide the deepest social insights available. Request a demo,Brian,January 18 2015

There are millions of conversations happening within many different niche audiences - all of which have different interest needs value and buying potential. Understanding who your target audience is and identifying the people and things that matter most to them is the key to becoming a leader on social. When a brand creates content it’s critical that it's endorsed by the right people to give it the amplification and social credibility needed for it to go viral within a target audience. A target audience of people with similar interests and affinities is often called a tribe. Each tribe has a group of leaders (also known as influencers) - people who the members of the tribe follow and trust. As a brand it’s your job to find engage and empower these influencers to become brand advocates so they can help you spread your message throughout a high value tribe. The challenge is how do you find these influencers? And once you find them how do you measure their level of influence to ensure they actually matter to the customers you want to attract? Finding key influencers Finding influencers starts by identifying and analyzing tribes with high affinity to your brand. To do this Affinio uses award winning technology to identify and segment any social audience into tribes. Once we’ve identified the high value tribes we extract and present the most influential accounts specific to each tribe. Unlike Klout or Kred which scores influence on a global level Affinio finds the influencers that matter most to a tribe and provides an affinity score that measures their relevance and influence to a given tribe. Scoring tribe influence Below are the influencers for a group of digital strategists that we are targeting in London and Paris. When you hover over each influencer we present their influence to the members of this tribe as an "affinity score". Developing content Now that you have the tribes and influencers identified the next step is to create content that will resonate. To ensure the content you create fits the brand and vibe of each influencer Affinio provides in depth content reports that outlines what is being shared and discussed within each tribe. This takes the guesswork out of content creation and strategy allowing you to focus on creating the best possible content. Request a demo,Brian,November 19 2014

We now know that Mcluhan was right and 50 years later Seth Godin thinks that now for the first time everyone has an opportunity to start a movement - to bring together a tribe of like-minded people and do amazing things. There are tribes everywhere all of them hungry for connection meaning and change. Finding and understanding the tribes that matter most to your business is the key to any great marketing campaign. This user centered approach allows you to get inside the head of your ideal customer to better understand the types of content that will connect on a truly personal level.

After the announcement Twitter's stock jumped nearly 8 percent as this may be the shake up needed to help Twitter continue to grow and further monetize their user base. With the hunt for a new CEO in full swing Twitter needs to turn their attention to improving the product and the ability to place highly targeted ads on it. Social advertising is not a static market and new players are going to make it even harder for Twitter to capture a larger percentage of spend from advertisers. It’s known that Facebook LinkedIn and Google have fairly robust advertising platforms so the real threat isn’t from above but below. Instagram and Pinterest have previously been closed off or hard to use by advertisers but sweeping changes on both are opening the floodgates and giving advertisers access to these new content-rich audiences. If Twitter is going to compete (and win) percentage of spend against Instagram and Pinterest they’re going to need a CEO who understands advertising. With Dick Costolo out the names of both Jack Dorsey and Adam Bain have been thrown around a lot as the next full-time CEO of Twitter. At Affinio we specialize in understanding the audiences that care about key topics events and people. If Twitter wants a CEO that understands advertising digging into the audiences of potential hires to see who has the largest influence and understanding of advertising is a great place to start. Process We took the followers of Adam Bain Jack Dorsey and Dick Costolo and segmented each into tribes of people based on their interests and affinities. Dick Costolo: Jack Dorsey: Adam Bain: Findings While Adam Bain had the smallest audience of 68711 compared to 1521673 for Costolo and 3018235 for Dorsey he had the largest % of his audience interested in marketing advertising and content creation. % of audience interested in marketing advertising and content creation Bain: 18% Dorsey: 13% Costolo: 10% Another interesting find was the tribe within Bain's audience that consisted solely of Advertisers. This tribe of 2068 people self-describe using the following terms - you can see how advertising related terms over indexed compared to the rest of the users on Twitter: This tribe of advertisers within Bain's audience have high affinity to these accounts: While Dorsey and Costolo have larger audiences Bain has attracted exactly the type of people Twitter needs to impress if they are to take (and keep) spend from Instagram and Pinterest.

,121,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,121,http://www.affinio.com/blog/viola-davis-win-dominates-the-emmy-twitter-conversation,Viola Davis' win dominates the Emmy Twitter conversation,Image: Time.com Last night's Emmy Awards was the star-studded evening that it normally is with the addition of an exceptionally bright star. History was made when Viola Davis was the first woman of color ever to win Best Actress in a drama series. Her acceptance speech was overwhelmingly powerful quoting Harriet Tubman and pointing out that "The only thing that separates women of color from anyone else is opportunity." We always like to understand who is talking about big events and in what context; the Emmy's were no different. To further understand the conversation around the Emmy's last night we looked at anyone who mentioned "#Emmy" or "#Emmy2015" then segmented them based on their interest profile (or who they choose to follow). The following is a visualization of these segmentations. Audience Visualization As you can see there is a theme here... Women. While it's expected that there would be a 'TV/Film Industry' community within this audience the rest of the communities are dominantly Female tribes. Could this be because of Viola's historic win and the presence of so many strong female role models at the awards show? When analyzing the content shared within each tribe there are two items that are consistent across all tribes. They were all discussing the Emmy's (obviously) and they all mentioned Viola Davis. Each tribe is defined by their interest profile. Below we'll take a look at the top 100 relevant accounts to each segment then some example tweets where they mention Viola Davis to understand the context in which they discuss her win within each tribe.

Using Social Data to Find Personas,What do rappers fashion models and hikers all have in common? Timberlands! The Timberlands brand transcends styles and subcultures and has taken its place beside Converse and Vans as one of the most iconic (and versatile) footwear designers. ^Here's a Timberland When developing a product or a brand knowing the many different types of buyers you have is critical to building strategies creative and messaging that resonate. Timberlands are a great example of a product being adopted by a wide range of personas each who have their own values experiences and thoughts about the product. To better understand the different types of people who buy wear and love Timberlands we analyzed the 764116 people who follow @Timberland on Instagram. This analysis identifies the different types of people in an audience segments them into personas based on their shared interests and passions and then provides all the psychographic and cultural insights needed to truly understand what those interests and passion are. 1. Personas found within Timberlands IG audience: Most relevant accounts to users following Timberlands on IG: @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow 2.Extracting insights from Timberlands IG audience: Affinio's segmentation groups users into clusters of people (we call them personas) based on their interests and affinities. This means that each persona found within an audience contains users who all shares similar passions. This is extremely useful when trying to identify the various personas contained within your (or a competitor's) social audience. Once found Affinio extracts insights on who they are how they self-describe and the content they care about most. As an example here's a summary of two personas found within Timberlands IG audience: Accounts with the highest relevance to the Outdoors persona: @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow Accounts with the highest relevance to the Rap persona: @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow Top used hashtags by Outdoors persona: Top used hashtags by Rap persona: Top tagged accounts in images by Outdoors persona: Top tagged accounts in images by Rap persona: Top used emojis by Outdoors persona: Top used emojis by Rap persona: Popular images by people in Outdoors persona: "The Trek Fuel EX 29 just keeps getting better." - @outsidemagazine #bikeporn #trekfuelex #bike #MTB #nature #29er A photo posted by Trek Bicycle (@trekbikes) on Sep 22 2015 at 5:24am PDT #repost Wah Gojek sampe Semeru nih neng 😂👏.

At Affinio we believe the best way to understand an audience is through the analysis of the social graph as it provides a look into the 90% of an audience that keyword or mention based tools ignore. To help you better understand what the social graph is and why it matters so much we created the following infographic:,Brian,March 23 2015
,124,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,124,http://www.affinio.com/blog/analyzing-topical-content-consumption-by-personas,Analyzing Topical Content Consumption by Persona,Websites generally have their content broken out into different sections or tags to make navigating and finding relevant information easier. This allows one site to post content on a wide variety of topics and still provide a focused topical browsing experience. Understanding the visitors and consumers of these different sections within a site has traditionally been very difficult due to the lack of visibility into who these visitors actually are. Sure you can use tools to track how people move throughout a site but there hasn't been anything to help you understand the people who read one section vs another. Understanding who your audience is and if they are an ideal buyer or not is critical to understanding the performance of your content. With this in mind we just updated our platform to enable users to analyze people who have shared any link or domain making it possible to dive deep into the worlds of those who are sharing your content on social. As an example we looked at anyone who shared content from either id.vice (the fashion and style section of Vice) or noisey.vice (their music section). Once we found everyone who shared content from each subsection of Vice Affinio automatically segmented them into tribes based on their interests and affinities. Here's how it works: By analyzing the people sharing content from each section we are able to understand who's attracted to each type of content. These readers are then segmented into tribes which provide the foundation for creating in-depth buyer (or listener) personas and contain all the psychographic details needed to truly understand each audience segment. Tribes found to be sharing I-D Vice content: Tribes found to be sharing Noisey Vice content: The network graphs above highlight the differences between the two audiences. It's natural to assume that fashion fans will like fashion and music fans will like music but understanding the interests and sub-communities within each niche is what sets Affinio apart. Are rock fans visiting your site or rap fans? How many of each? What sites are rap fans visiting and who do they care about most? What about rock fans? What content and accounts are hot in that niche right now? Which brands do they love most? Which news outlets and personalities do they trust? These are the questions that Affinio has been developed to help answer. To showcase how in-depth the insights we provide are here's a breakdown of the UK Grime tribe (A genre I didn't even know existed until I ran this report). Top accounts to UK Grime Fans: @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow Top Videos to UK Grime Fans: Top Vice articles to UK Grime Fans: Stormzy Started Doing "Shut Up" And Then Had To Pass The Mic To This Girl | NOISEY Watch Stormzy Drop Bars In a Church With a Gospel Choir | NOISEY Jammer's "Royal Rumble" Video Features More Major Grime MCs Than We Could Fit in This Title | NOISEY Rise Craig David Your Time is Now | NOISEY Watch Tanika Hit the Streets of Brixton in Her New Video For "Fuckboy" | NOISEY Stormzy Started Doing "Shut Up" And Then Had To Pass The Mic To This Girl | NOISEY Get Ready to Call Your Ex: Disclosure and Sam Smith Cover Drake's "Hotline Bling" | NOISEY Police in America are Searching for a Suspect Who Tried to Rob a Bank Dressed as Rick James | NOISEY We Asked Our Six Favorite Illustrators to Re-Imagine the 'Straight Outta Compton' Album Cover | NOISEY Rick Ross Exudes Coke-Fueled Greatness With His New Mixtape 'Black Dollar' | NOISEY Top Hashtags to UK Grime Fans: Top Mentioned accounts by UK Grime Fans: Top Domains to UK Grime Fans: This level of insight on any niche culture helps publishers and creators take a more empathetic approach to content creation and distrubtion.

FanDuel and DraftKings are both real money fantasy sports sites each with a valuation of over $900 Million and they have been flooding NFL commercial breaks with up to $32 Million worth of ads each week. This level of spending is needed to bring users onto the platform and boost the scale of the games being played. While this plan is powering massive growth in each company they’ve also received their fair share of negative feedback as some viewers are sick of seeing their ads: Just when you thought you made it 2 minutes without seein’ a Fan Duel or Draft Kings commercial. Merica. https://t.co/UPQD2TzKrw — Cloyd Rivers (@CloydRivers) September 22 2015 When you're afraid to watch commercials because you know there's going to be another Draft Kings or FanDuel ad pic.twitter.com/OLl1ZturBv — SpongeBob Sports (@SpongeBobSports) September 22 2015 It’s clear that FanDuel and DraftKings are set on onboarding as many users as possible so we thought we’d help them out by analyzing the audiences of each to find out who’s playing and the best ways to attract/retain them. To do this Affinio combined the Twitter audiences of both FanDuel and DraftKings then segmented them into personas based on their interests and affinities. Here are the personas Affinio's unsupervised segmentation found with the audience of FanDuel and Draftkings: These tribes (also known as personas) represent the different types of people who are interested in online gaming. Affinio’s segmentation also measures the relevance and share of audience both FanDuel and DraftKings have within each tribe. The infographic below shows how each are performing within a few of the personas: (click image to expand) Now that we’ve segmented the audience into tribes we can explore the psychographic profiles of each tribe to better understand who they are and the brands people content and domains that matter most to them. As an example the following are some of the insights from the Daily Fantasy Sports tribe.

'50s cigarette ad level — Hothead Weasel (@draftcheat) September 14 2015 Emojis they use the most: Domains they sourced content from the most: How can these insights help FanDuel and DraftKings? Persona Generation Affinio’s algorithms segment any audience into tribes of people based on their interests and affinities. These detailed psychographic insights would help both companies create data-driven personas allowing them to understand their various customer segments on a cultural and personal level. Content Strategy Affinio uncovers the content that matters most to a specific niche. Both FanDuel and DraftKings could use this information as a content marketing cheat sheet allowing them to see what’s popular and build creative for the right platforms involving the right topics and then serve it to the right audience. Media Planning Affinio finds the accounts domains content and people that matter most to any niche audience. Both brands could use these insights to inform ad placement partnerships and creative. (and judging by the 32 Million they are spending a week on ads they really want to get this part right). Targeted Advertising Once each company has segmented their audience and found personas they want to target Affinio’s lookalike modeling can find everyone else who’s just like those people and supply highly targeted lists. FanDuel and DraftKings could use these lists to target users who share the same interests and affinities as their ideal customer even if they’ve never mentioned specific keywords or tweeted about online gaming. Brand Partnerships Affinio can help both FanDuel and DraftKings find the brands blogs and sports teams that have the highest influence on their ideal customers. This would help them align their messaging and pick key partnerships to ensure they are growing their brand in a way that will resonate with their ideal customer. Influencer Marketing Affinio can find the celebrities musicians comedians sports stars bloggers (and just about anyone else) who matter most to their ideal customer. This list would allow them to build their influencer marketing campaigns with confidence knowing that everyone they select truly matters to their ideal customer. Competitive analysis Finally they could use Affinio to analyze key competitors to gain insights into who their audience is and the types of content they care about most. This would allow them to learn how they are performing within key audience segments (similar to the infographic above) and then conquest against key audience segments.

,130,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,130,http://www.affinio.com/blog/meet-the-american-teens-who-idolize-el-chapos-drug-empire,Meet the American teens who idolize El Chapo's drug empire,Photo by Fabrizio León Diez Joaquín Guzmán Loera is a Mexican drug lord who recently escaped from a maximum security prison and is now back in charge of the Sinaloa Cartel one of the biggest and most dangerous drug trafficking organizations in the world. Known as “El Chapo” (Shorty) his drug empire has earned him a personal fortune estimated at $1B. It’s also estimated that his cartel is responsible for 40-60% of the cocaine that enters the US every year which results in annual revenues of around $3B comparable to the revenues of a massive tech company such as Netflix. Forbes has ranked Guzmán as one of the most powerful people in the world every year since 2009 and is considered to be the 10th richest person in Mexico. Despite the fact that law enforcement agencies around the world mark him as one of the world's most dangerous and wanted criminals he’s grown into a Robin Hood-like figure for a wide variety of people all over the world. While his popularity and support is strongest in his home country of Mexico he has also attracted a wider international fanbase including a group of young Americans. Using Affinio we analyzed El Chapo’s 394430 followers on Twitter which revealed a tribe of American teens within his audience: Where members of this tribe are located: Key terms used in their Twitter bios: Digging in deeper revealed that this tribe of American teens are primarily interested in rap and pop culture. Accounts such as Kanye West Meek Mill Lil Wayne Gucci Mane and Kim Kardashian are amongst the top 100 most relevant accounts to these individuals. These accounts are identified by analyzing who/what the members of this tribe follow other than 'El Chapo' or what else they are interested in. Top 100 accounts most relevant to the tribe of American Teens: It’s not surprising that this tribe of teens are interested in Guzmán as well as rap music given that several leading rappers including the infamous Gucci Mane have songs about El Chapo. The insights above start to give us a look into who these teens are where they live and what they are interested in. Digging deeper into the content they share and discuss helps us build a much more detailed persona of who they are and the things they value most. Top used hashtags by this tribe of American Teens: When exploring the top used hashtags by these tribe members El Chapo is #1. He’s also the second most mentioned account only beaten by Donald Trump. Recently El Chapo has reportedly threatened to end Trump’s life for his recent comments about El Chapo and Mexico. This was big news for this tribe of El Chapo-adoring teens. Top mentioned accounts: To understand further what these teens are interested in we looked at the tweets that were favorited most by this tribe: (This tweet from El Chapo was removed from Twitter) Donald trump better take it easy talking crazy about #ELCHAPO that's a different ball game! #leavehimalone — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) July 13 2015 Y tú @EPN no me vuelvas a llamar delincuente porqué yo doy trabajo a la gente no como tu pinche gobierno corriente. — Joaquín Guzmán Loera (@ElChap0Guzman) July 13 2015 En esta vida el que no arriesga no gana. — Joaquín Guzmán Loera (@ElChap0Guzman) July 13 2015 God blessing all da trap n!gga$ #ElChapo — FUTURE/FREEBANDZ (@1future) July 12 2015 @realDonaldTrump you a real fucking lame for what said about the Mexican community. — Waka Flocka Flame (@WakaFlocka) July 5 2015 Today is a big step in our march toward equality. Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry just like anyone else. #LoveWins — President Obama (@POTUS) June 26 2015 NOW LETS TRY TO GET AMERICA TO LIKE NIGGAS — Tyler The Creator (@fucktyler) June 26 2015 These teens are favoriting tweets that are heavily in support of El Chapo and in some cases very against Donald Trump. It's evident that this tribe of American teens is offended by Donald Trump’s comments about Mexicans as well as El Chapo himself and they were excited to see celebrities and Guzmán attacking Trump in retaliation. When we reviewed the top shared links by members of this tribe we were able to gain further insight into why Guzmán is considered to be a hero to this tribe. Top shared links & tweets by tribe members: This fall your legacy is more than a name.

Raised on rap music Instagram and Snapchat these teens are rejecting American conservatives such as Donald Trump and are in support of liberal political moves such as legalizing same-sex marriage. This analysis shows that they also idolize underdog self-made people such as Meek Mill Kanye West Drake Eminem Lil Wayne Gucci Mane and El Chapo himself - regardless of the potentially violent means each used to pull themselves out of poverty and into a wealthy lavish life. The fact that one of the most popular and over indexing terms these teens use to self-describe is “money” not only indicates where their interests lay but also reinforces that they seem to support people who made it themselves vs. someone who inherited it like Trump reportedly did.,Brian,July 17 2015
,131,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,131,http://www.affinio.com/blog/what-pizza-brands-do-americans-love-most,What Pizza Brands Do Americans Love Most?,Affinio’s data has been used by many people for many things but none of them have asked the ultimate question to our algorithms until now. Who’s eating pizza and where do they buy it? This is probably one of the most important questions in business because we live in an unprecedented period of human history where few things are certain except that there will always be people and they will always want pizza. According to Franchise disclosure documents Americans eat an average of 100 acres of pizza every day which equates to roughly 250 slices every second. Pizza sales are roughly $40 billion a year which is approximately 17% of all restaurants in the US. With the goal of finally cracking who’s eating which pizza we used Affinio to analyze the Twitter audiences of @dominos @papajohns @pizzahut @littlecaesars @chuckecheese @papamurphys and @giordanospizza. Affinio analyzed 197687 people and found 13 distinct audience personas then measured the relevance of each pizza brand to each segment. It’s important to note that our algorithms analyzed 100% of people in these audiences by looking at their network connections this means we are able to map everyone's interests even if they’ve never tweeted about pizza before. Audience segments found: After reviewing each audience segment we found that a few segments contained people we refer to as “equal opportunity pizza enthusiasts” meaning they had no clear preference between brands. The other segments specifically the Teen Pizza Fans Conservative Christians WWE fans and Coupon Moms were selective with their pizza and had clear favorites. Conservative Christian Pizza Preferences: WWE Fan Pizza Preferences: Teen Pizza Preferences: Coupon Moms Pizza Preferences: When we normalized the audiences to adjust for the difference in total audience size Chuck E. Cheese’s was the most relevant to Couponing Moms yet the least relevant to Teen Pizza Fans which may suggest that they are tired of going with their mothers and would much rather grab some Pizza Hut with their friends. Papa John’s and Papa Murphy’s dominate the Conservative Christians segment (Maybe the names with “Papa” in them resonate best with their strong family values) while both Pizza Hut and Domino’s flop big time in this segment. The WWE fans segment is the most balanced of the four reviewed with Giordano’s and Little Caesar’s pulling ahead of the pack. Insights such as these allow brand and agencies to understand how they stack against their competitors in key segments. If Chuck E’ Cheese wanted to conquest against Pizza Hut to win back the Teens who love pizza segment they could use Affinio to find the most relevant celebrities to these teens and cast them in their next campaign. Affinio also provides a list of the most popular TV shows to any audience segment. This would help Chuck E. Cheese know which shows and networks they should be advertising on if they want to win back pizza loving teens. They could also review the most relevant content to these teens allowing them to understand the topics content accounts and even emojis that matter most. Finally they could use Affinio’s Tailored Audiences to push ads to these pizza-loving teens on Twitter (Instagram and Pinterest ad targeting coming soon!)

,132,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,132,http://www.affinio.com/blog/radio-isnt-dead-using-social-data-to-understand-listener-personas,Radio isn't dead: Using social data to understand listener personas,Radio is a fantastic medium. I spent six happy years in the Irish radio market and I count this time as being both the bedrock to my career and some of the best times of my life. Radio is a passion to both those who listen and those who work in it. It has the unique property of being accessible anywhere and has survived the digital age better than its other traditional rivals. It is relatively cheap to produce and is somewhat of a cultural icon in certain countries. The one area where radio is let down is in its audience measurement and insights. The antiquated sampling is the lifeblood of the industry yet it is based on the paradigm of consumer research rather than the consumer reality brought about with the age of data. Anecdotal evidence from the station’s social producers and insight from traditional social listening programmes only give a small snapshot of what is actually going on in these audiences. Both are entirely dependent on delivering insights from what people say on social. These sample sizes provide only a glimpse into any audience. It does not give the whole picture and the outdated methodology does not give you an up to date picture of what is going on now. Radio needs to understand its audiences better it needs to understand who their audiences are and what they are talking about on a more regular basis than once a quarter. On average only 10% of a Twitter audience is posting and engaging regularly while the majority are silent “lurkers.” That means that companies are basing their social strategies on a small minority of users. Affinio looks at 100% of the audience and starts to understand who they are by the social graph who they have connection and affinity with. Using Affinio we analyzed the audience of @kissfmuk one of London’s top radio stations. The ~524k followers were segmented into niche tribes based on their interests and similarities as seen below on the social graph. It was particularly interesting to find that 8% of @kissfmuk’s audience were passionate ‘Football Fans.’ Here’s how these users self describe: Top 100 relevant accounts Top used hashtags: Top mentioned accounts: Top 10 most favorited tweets: My next single is called #PlayGround Featuring @iAmShakka RT & Fav 😆 pic.twitter.com/W3hntaDtBA — #PLAYGROUND (@LethalBizzle) July 10 2015 I'm very excited to announce that Hammond May and I have signed a deal with .@AmazonVideo — Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) July 30 2015 Biggest honour of my career so far being captain of this great football club.

They will be able to have a holistic data-driven view of their audience in real time and be able to market their promotions products and services to these audiences in a much more relevant and accountable way. Radio has embraced the social revolution well and it is the most socially integrated medium by far. Most shows have Twitter and Facebook accounts and will often utilise the social technologies to enhance the show and connect with the customers. Social and radio compliment each other well and are a potent mix for advertisers. So in understanding the social audience you can gain real insight on the overall radio audience. Social has already had a massive impact on radio a positive one too. The next step is real understanding of their social audience and the monetisation and utilization of that data to make a better advertising platform for their partners and a more relevant and engaging brand for their consumers.,Philip Macartney,August 13 2015

The trends today evolve so quickly it's hard to keep up with them. Being the cool kid was easier before social networks now you are competing with the coolest people from around the world. So as a 'cool kid wannabe' (or a brand who wants to know the latest) how do you stay on top? With Instagram rolling out their ads platform marketers and advertisers really need to know what's going on in various audience segments if they are going to build and serve targeted content that performs. To help you out we started by analyzing 982K followers Supreme New York to better understand what's cool. Why Supreme? Supreme has been one of the driving forces in contemporary fashion since opening their first store on Lafayette Street in 1994. Part skateboarding part hip-hop all awesome and street Supreme oozes 2015 cool and has worked with the likes of Tyler the Creator Lady Gaga Kate Moss Lou Reid Mike Tyson Jeff Koons and even Kermit the Frog. (Kate Moss for Supreme) Using Affinio Supreme's audience was segmented into 16 distinct tribes allowing us to review each and find the tribe of trendsetters whose lives on Instagram revolve around being as cool and trendy as possible.

Rather than spraying ads at people who might be interested in a topic Affinio allows advertisers to build lists of high-affinity users based on interests and affinities ensuring that the right people see the right ad. In addition to targeting Affinio can also help marketers and creatives come up with content that will perform best within a niche. We do this by extracting and presenting all the top performing content within a specific niche providing a cheat sheet or mood board of everything that's hot within the audience you are trying to target.

,134,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,134,http://www.affinio.com/blog/how-twitter-tailored-audiences-transformed-affinios-audience,How Twitter Tailored Audiences transformed Affinio's audience,Back in November we wrote a case study about how we were using our own platform to gain inbound leads through Twitter Tailored Audiences. Since then we have seen great success using this method to bring in highly qualified leads and connect with industry leaders. A short recap of what we did: We identified Digital Strategists as a target market for Affinio. Through our platform we identified a tribe of people that fit our target. We then used our 'look alike' modeling to identify 200000 people that were similar to this tribe based on their relationships and affinities. They didn't need to say that they worked in the area of Digital Marketing based on their Social DNA we were able to assume that they did. We then uploaded this list to Twitter Tailored Audiences and placed highly targeted ads. Check out this post for a more detailed explanation. While this is successful for connecting us with potential customers over the last few months we noticed something else happening. We periodically analyze our own audience and noticed a huge change happening over the last few months since we started running these ads. Our influencer landscape was transforming and it is so cool! Affinio is a technology startup located in Halifax Nova Scotia (very east coast of Canada). When we first analyzed our audience we had 250 followers. Here is what our entire audience's influencers looked like then: If you are familiar with the Halifax tech startup scene you'll recognize pretty much everyone here. The top influencers of our followers include our founders some other members of the Halifax Tech Community some incubators and investors other tech companies etc. This shows us that the people interested in us were our local community members but not necessarily our target market. Our ideal customer didn't know that we existed. Let's fast forward to today. This is what the influencers of our current audience look like: Now this is an ideal influencer list. The people or companies that influence our audience today (or who they have top affinity to) are the business leaders and top publishers agencies and companies in the Digital Strategy world. We created an animated demonstration of this evolution over time. The following 2 gifs show the influencers of our audience at 250 500 750 1000 1250 and 1500 followers. In the gif below we see Tim Burke - CEO of Affinio start as a top influencer of our audience and move down the list over time. We also notice those local influencers moving down and completely disappearing. Tim moving down the list of Affinio's audiences Influencers The following shows Ogilvy appear about halfway through and move to the top of the list. We chose to show Ogilvy because back in November's post we noted Ogilvy as a top influencer of our target audience. Olgivy moving up the list of Affinio's audiences Influencers Why is this important? It's not the size of your audience it's who your audience is. We have 1531 followers as of this morning this is not a large audience but it's the right audience. This demonstrates that through using the right targeting and an effective way to reach your target market you are able to get their attention. This also demonstrates the importance of monitoring the changes in your audience when implementing new programs. If you launch a new effort to target your market in addition to other KPIs monitoring how your audience transforms is a key indicator of success. There's no denying that the transformation of our audience's influencer network demonstrates the success or our targeting. The next challenge is engaging this audience but we'll leave that to another day. What are you thoughts about the right audience over the size of your audience? To find out more about how we identified this list to target you can sign up for a demo or feel free to reach out to me on twitter - it would be great to hear from you!,India,March 06 2015

It has become so important that designers such as Alexander Wang are now creating fashion shows that specifically designed to be shared on Instagram. This makes the exclusive world of designer fashion much more accessible as anyone with a smartphone can now follow the world's best designers and trends all in one place. Instagram also allows consumers to find the best deals on designer fashion as the platform has been adopted by all of the top online fashion retailers. To better understand the current landscape of men's designer fashion we analyzed the 463254 people who follow Mr. Porter on Instagram. Mr. Porter is an award-winning global retail destination for men's style combining the best international menswear with editorial content. The site sells over 300 leading international brands including Alexander McQueen Givenchy Raf Simons Lanvin Loro Piana Maison Kitsune Boglioli A.P.C Beams Plus J.Crew Church’s and Common Projects. 1. Audience segments found within Mr. Porter's IG audience: Most relevant accounts to users following Mr. Porter on IG: 2. Extracting insights from these users Affinio's segmentation groups users into tribes based on their interests and affinities. This means that each group found within an audience contains users who all shares similar passions. This is extremely useful when trying to identify the various personas contained within your (or a competitors) social audience. Once found Affinio extracts insights on who they are how they self-describe and the content they care about most. As an example here's a summary of two tribes found within Mr. Porters Instagram audience.

,137,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,137,http://www.affinio.com/blog/gatorade-and-the-efficiency-of-their-endorsement-dollars,Gatorade and the Efficiency of their Endorsement Dollars,On June 24th an announcement was made that the Montreal Canadiens star defenseman PK Subban joined the extensive list of Gatorade endorsed athletes becoming the newest addition to the Gatorade "team". This news inspired us to run a report on the social audience of Gatorade to look for other professional athletes with high affinity to Gatorade. To start we used Affinio to segment the audience of @Gatorade into niche tribes of people based on their interests and affinities. Affinio analyzes what people follow on Twitter and clusters them together based on the similarities in their following patterns. Gatorade is a performance enhancing sports drink therefore one would assume that the tribes were separated by players and fans of different sports. Sure enough as you can see the majority of Gatorade’s audience is made up of “tribes” of sports fans and athletes including Basketball Football and Soccer tribes and the more generic Running Advocates/Marathoners Skateboarders/Nascar fans and General Aspiring Athletes. What was intriguing to us wasn’t necessarily the sports tribes that we found but rather the ones we expected to see but did not. When you review the content on Gatorade's twitter feed the athletes that were featured the most in Gatorade's advertising were: Peyton Manning (Image source geeksandcleats.com) Serena Williams Tweets by @serenawilliams Bryce Harper Tweets by @Bharper3407 Abby Wambach Tweets by @AbbyWambach Usain Bolt Tweets by @usainbolt Patrick Kane Tweets by @88PKane Jimmie Johnson Tweets by @JimmieJohnson A football player tennis player baseball player soccer player runner hockey player and NASCAR driver. Interestingly enough although Patrick Kane is currently someone who Gatorade is pushing heavily to attract hockey related audiences we were unable to find a sizable subsegment of hockey fans in the report. It’s also important to note that we were unable to find a baseball fan tribe despite Gatorade endorsing Bryce Harper a star in the MLB. All other athletes (excluding Peyton Manning who is not on twitter and Serena Williams) could be found somewhere in top 200 highest affinity accounts for their respective tribes. But the fact that Gatorade is putting major advertising power and money into two well known and respected athletes and their respective sports did not show up as a distinct tribe in the report we found surprising. To further verify that Gatorade is not currently a highly associated brand with the NHL or MLB in the eyes of the Twitter public we ran reports on both major sports organizations to see where Gatorade stacks up. After reviewing these reports Gatorade was not found in the overall top 1000 highest affinity accounts for followers of both the MLB and NHL. So will the new deal with P.K. Subban grow Gatorade’s brand affinity with hockey fans? In terms of our social affinity analysis and given PK’s strong Twitter presence (+640K followers) it would look like this is a solid bet for Gatorade.,Jacob Burke,July 10 2015

Beers such as Guinness Harp O'Hara's are all great but to truly experience local Irish beer culture you have to be drinking the work of a master craft brewer. As a Canadian I really enjoy craft beer (Propeller and Tatamagouche are a couple of my favourites) - but I have no idea what's going on in the Irish craft beer world. To quickly come up to speed on the culture of craft beer in Ireland I analyzed beer drinkers in the country to figure out which craft brewing accounts mattered most to them. After reviewing the results I put together a guide to the top 10 accounts on Twitter that you need to follow to become an expert in the world of Irish craft beer. 1. Beoir Tweets by @BeoirOrg 2. EightDegreesBrewing Tweets by @8degreesbrewing 3. GalwayHookerBrewery Tweets by @HookerBrewery 4. Carlow Brewing Co Tweets by @OHarasBeers 5. Metalman Brewing Tweets by @metalmanbrewing 6.

,139,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,139,http://www.affinio.com/blog/alex-morgan-first-female-on-ea-sports-cover-and-shouldnt-be-the-last,Alex Morgan: First Female on EA Sports Cover and Shouldn't be the Last,On July 20th Electronic Arts announced that for the first time in history a female athlete will be on the cover of their FIFA 16 video game. In Canada that woman will be Christine Sinclair sharing the spotlight with Lionel Messi. Alex Morgan a member of the US National Women’s 2015 FIFA World Cup Championship team will be sharing the cover with Messi in the United States. EA FIFA is the top selling sports franchise video game in the world with more than 18 million matches of FIFA 15 played per day in the first six months from its release. While some may think that a women being put on an EA Sports cover is not a big deal given the fact that topics such as the gender wage gap in international soccer are currently in discussion and trending worldwide this new image could become another important move in gender equality and the first small steps to filling wage gaps such as these in sports. The news of this cover motivated us at Affinio to run reports on other EA Sports franchises on twitter such as EA Sports NHL and EA Sports NBA Live. With the publicity and attention EA is gaining from this gender equal cover release is it possible they may contemplate doing the same with these other sports game as well? Using Affinio’s algorithms the top 1000 profiles of interest with high affinity to each video game were ranked. In the NHL report there were not any female hockey players to be found in the top 1000. However that wasn’t the case for the second report. Profile No. 388 belonged to Skylar Diggins in the NBA Live report. An American professional basketball player for the Tulsa Shock of the WNBA. Tweets by @SkyDigg4 This spiked our curiosity because NBA Live currently does not include any options in the game that would allow you to play in the WNBA or use teams from that league. But even still people are recognizing a WNBA player to EA’s NBA Live. Using Affinio’s audience insights we then ran a report on EA Sports FIFA’s twitter profile to see where Alex Morgan and Christine Sinclair ranked in top interests for their own respective EA game to compare with the ranking of Skylar Diggins. Alex Morgan was found at profile No. 511 and Christine Sinclair was not in the top 1000. Skylar Diggins ranked higher in her relevance and recognition to her EA sport than Alex Morgan to her own EA game! Therefore if EA was to put Skylar Diggins on the cover of an NBA Live game this could theoretically generate even more interest from EA NBA LIVE audiences than Alex Morgan’s cover currently is from EA FIFA audiences. Granted Electronic Arts has already announced that Russell Westbrook will be the face of the next up and coming NBA Live 16. But if there’s any thought on repeating this dual gender cover in other sporting games in the future are they aware that there is a woman basketball player currently with greater recognition to the NBA Live games than Alex Morgan’s recognition and relevance to the FIFA games? If EA is looking to continue with dual gender covers our affinity data suggests they should seriously consider having this Tulsa Shock point gaurd featured on the front of NBA Live 17.

This followed a weekend of turmoil that started late Friday after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras made the decision to hold a July 5 referendum on austerity. Many fear that Greece will exit the Euro. While the Greek people rushed to ATMs to capture as much cash as possible the world markets were also taking stock of the late Friday announcement. The Stoxx European Index slid 2.5 percent by 6:57 a.m. (ET) Monday morning and in New York S&P 500 Index futures fell by 1.1 percent. We looked at the use of several Greece crisis related hashtags over the last 30 days to understand who is talking about the crisis and who the most relevant news sources influencers and authorities are.

,141,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,141,http://www.affinio.com/blog/adidas-soon-to-become-the-most-dominant-brand-in-soccer-as-nike-couldnt-just-do-it,Adidas Vying to Become Most Dominant Brand in Soccer as Nike Couldn't "Just Do It",The soccer dynasty that is Manchester United has just recently agreed to terms with Adidas for a new kit manufacturing deal beginning in the 2015-2016 season that will encompass $750 million over the next 10 years. Nike was the previous sponsor and before Adidas came in to the new deal it was rumoured that there was talk of an extension deal with Nike that in all would be worth up to one billion dollars. However Nike decided to withhold from extending their 13 year partnership with the team stating that “the terms that were on offer for a renewed contract did not represent good value for Nike’s shareholders”. This new contract with Adidas has already been described as one of the most lucrative in sports to date. With the plan to spend more money on one soccer team per year than any other brand has done previously it is clear Adidas is extremely optimistic with the return they expect to receive from their logo printed on the jerseys of The Red Devils starting next season . At Affinio we wanted to further analyze Adidas and Nike’s twitter audiences to see what (if any) insights could be found that would better showcase how this new deal may affect either brand and what may have motivated Adidas to agree to the tremendous size of this new contract. We ran reports on followers of both twitter accounts @Nike and @adidas. With Affinio's award winning technology these large audiences are analyzed and then broken into separate tribes based on the profiles in the tribe's geographical locations bio keywords used hashtags common interests and other significant traits. Common interests do a great deal in helping to distinguish different tribes from each other and the top 1000 profiles relevant to that tribe's interests are listed in a report 1 being the highest of relevance and 1000 being the lowest. In each tribe for Nike and Adidas' report we searched @ManUtd through it's interests tab and recorded whenever it was found in the top 1000 in relevance and the profile number it was ranked in the list. Each tribe in the graphic below with a number over it had Man-U's twitter profile found in it's top 1000 interests and the number itself shows where exactly the profile ranked in those lists of interests. As you can see Manchester United was found ranked in the top interests for 11 of Adidas' 17 tribes but only ranked in 9 of Nike's 17 tribes. The average of profile ranking for @ManUtd in Adidas' audience interests was #467but averaged a much lower ranking in Nike's audience at #563. In addition Manchester United was ranked at profile #149 for Nike's overall interests (this is referring to the list of 1000 interests in relevance to the entire report not one tribe in particular) and substantially higher for Adidas' at #77. Nike VS. Adidas Although Nike is currently the manufacturer of Manchester United’s kit this doesn’t seem to change the fact that the brand with clearly the higher recognition to the team from their respective audience still happens to be Adidas as Manchester United is found in more tribes interests rankings higher overall in those rankings and higher in overall interest to Adidas' report versus Nike's. To many this may have not been expected seeing as how Nike's famous check mark has been on on the team's jerseys for the past 13 seasons and Adidas hasn't controlled the kit since the 1992 season. Even still Adidas remains ahead of Nike in the soccer team’s recognition to sports brands. With this being the case even with Nike currently in a deal with The Red Devil’s it's obvious why Adidas agreed to such large terms in a new deal that should only accelerate audience interest pointed towards Adidas even more so. Therefore Adidas should be extremely excited for what is to come in the next ten years as they already are ($750 million dollars worth of excitement in fact) for the continued growth in recognition and overall audience of their brand in the world of soccer.,Jacob Burke,August 25 2015

In the HBO Now vs Netflix battle for online streaming dominance audience ownership is everything. To better understand the different audiences I used Affinio to combine and segment the followers of HBO and Netflix to better understand the different audience segments and each platforms ownership within it. Audience details: @netflix: 1.29M followers @HBO: 1.09M followers Total # of people analyzed: 2252007 The graphic above shows the breakdown of the different audience segments within the 2.25M people analyzed. Each colour represents a unique persona and the number of nodes represents the size of each segment within the total audience. Audience Ownership within a niche: The following shows the audience ownership of each platform within each niche persona. After reviewing it appears that HBO has a much stronger international audience while Netflix and HBO and battling for younger viewers each owning a few niche youth segments. It's also interesting that American sports fans have a high affinity to Netflix while UK sports fans gravitate towards HBO. Interested in using Affinio to perform competitive audience audits?

,146,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,146,http://www.affinio.com/blog/targeting-niche-audiences-on-instagram,Targeting niche audiences on Instagram,As Instagram starts to open up ads access to everyone finding and targeting the right audiences is going to be critical for advertisers who want to get the most out of the platform. The reason why targeting is going to be such a hot topic is because we've already seen what happens when the wrong content is sent to the wrong people: As you can imagine these are not the kinds of comments that brands eager to advertise on Instagram are looking for. The issue with the ad above is that it was clearly targeted to people who don't have high affinity to buying a Mercedes. To select and serve the right content to the right people advertisers need to start by identifying the various personas within an audience then select the ones they'd like to target. As an example we analyzed the audience of MUJI (@mujiusa) to illustrate how to find a niche audience for targeting on Instagram. I selected MUJI as an example because they cater to a certain type of customer with their diverse line of thoughtful simple well-designed products. Process We started with the 27.9K followers of MUJI USA on Instagram and used Affino to segment this audience into niche tribes of people who share the same interests and affinities: Once segmented we were able to find 9 distinct audience segments that all had their own unique traits and characteristics. This segmentation enables us to build ads for each niche and then target only the people on Instagram who fit the persona that the ad will resonate with. To do this simply use Affinio's lookalike modelling to extend this audience to build a larger list of everyone who fits the interest profiles of a specific tribe. For example: If we wanted to target designers in Korea we could use the 1722 people who are in the "Korean designer" tribe within MUJI's audience as a seed then use Affinio to find everyone else on Instagram who's a designer in Korea even if they don't follow MUJI. Once this high-affinity list of Korean designers is ready we could then target them with ads built specifically for them. We could repeat this process to target other niche audiences to ensure each audience segment is getting content designed specifically for them.

,147,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,147,http://www.affinio.com/blog/segmenting-a-fashion-audience-to-find-luxury-consumers,Segmenting a fashion audience to find luxury consumers,SSENSE is an online retailer that specializes in the curation and sale of the worlds leading fashion brands. These brands including Saint-Laurent Givenchy Thom Browne Valentino Hood by Air Acne Studios Giuseppe Zanotti Maison Martin Margiela Marc Jacobs Alexander McQueen Balmain and more - set the bar for both quality and style. This elite product catalog also comes with an elite price - a pair of shoes on SSENSE can run over $8000 and you can spend as much as $41000 on a jacket. (Image from SSENSE) It only takes a few minutes of scrolling on their Twitter to see that SSENSE understands the power of content marketing and how to target luxury consumers. Their steady stream of beautifully curated photos videos events and products has attracted 19.7K followers. They've also commissioned over 100 music mixes by some of the worlds best music producers - perhaps in a bid to share their great taste to the world for free through music. Given the price points of the products carried it's safe to assume that many of these followers will never be customers. While many will never buy there are rich insights within their audience - specifically within the niche's that contain actual paying customers. To find these ideal buyers we must first define an in-depth buyer persona for customers and then score existing (as well as potential) followers to this archetype. This process has traditionally been done by hand and would require hours of endless scrolling and guessing - and the output would still be far from perfect. Thankfully Affinio is able to analyze the interests and affinities of everyone within this audience segment them into tribes of like minded people and then find the groups that best match ideal buyers. To do this I used Affinio to segment the followers of @ssense into 14 distinct tribes of like-minded people and here's what the algorithms found: After reviewing the tribes it became clear that the ones located near the bottom right of the graph best fit the profiles of potential buyers of designer fashion. You'll notice how the graph maps the high fashion fashion news online fashion shoppers and Montreal fashion tribes close to one another. This is a result of the shared affinities between tribes as they all interested in designer fashion in one way or another. It's important to note that SSENSE is based out of Montreal and as a result you can see the support the brand is getting by the tightly connected Montreal fashion community on Twitter. To better understand the interests of tribe members the top 1000 high-affinity accounts for each tribe were calculated scored and presented. The image below shows a sample of the accounts with the highest affinity and influence to the member of the high fashion tribe - they also map out nicely to the leading brands carried by SSENSE. In addition to influential and high-affinity accounts key tweets links and domain information is included in every Affinio report. The following are a sample of the top links shared by members of the high fashion tribes: Style.com: The Online Home of Fashion: News Runway Shows Trends Fashion Models Designers Shopping Beauty and Entertainment Style.com: The Online Home of Fashion: News Runway Shows Trends Fashion Models Designers Shopping Beauty and Entertainment The Fashion Law 15 Sweet White Lace Pieces for Spring Alexander Wang: The World's 100 Most Influential People Exclusive: Soo Joo Park on Breaking Beauty Barriers and Learning to "Own" Her Look Chanel the Saviour of Savoir-Faire Chanel the Saviour of Savoir-Faire Fashion's most iconic political statements This affinity-based segmentation easily found the tribes of people most likely to buy luxury goods from SSENSE. It also provides details on the specific people topics accounts and culture that matter most to these audience members allowing for more informed content and advertising efforts. This approach will also find the people that that are being attracted to SSENSE for non-fashion reasons. An excellent example of this is the tribe of people interested in underground DJ's - a result of all the mixes SSENSE has commissioned. This list of mixes can be found on soundcloud and includes work by many of the accounts that show up in the top affinity accounts below: Interested in segmenting a social audience to find your ideal customer?

,150,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,150,http://www.affinio.com/blog/how-social-graph-analysis-transcends-language,How Social Graph Analysis Removes Language Bias,One of Twitters greatest strengths is that it has a rich and diverse network of people who use many different languages to share their opinions on a global stage. Major cultural revolutions have taken place in the past 10 years and Twitter has played an important role in many of them due to its accessibility and the fact that it works in any language. With over 60 languages being used on Twitter it represents the closest civilization has come to everyone on earth being in the same forum all discussing the world together. As a user of Twitter I find this very exciting and encouraging - but as someone who's trying to analyze and learn from the conversation the language barrier can create many issues. One of the major challenges facing keyword based social analysis tools is that they rely solely on keyword and mention data to extract insights. While this approach can be sufficient for some applications when the conversation is in a language you understand it becomes extremely difficult when you start working with other languages or slang. To help illustrate the diversity of language being used on Twitter GNIP and MapBox built an awesome interactive map (click image to open interactive window) that shows the breakdown of where all of these different languages are being used. This diverse multilingual international engagement needs to be analyzed and understood and a graph-based approach is the key. By analyzing the relational connections of users you can segment social audiences into like-minded groups based on their interests and affinities regardless of the languages they speak. By using graph based analysis we have been able to map everything from Japanese drift car fans and Spanish-speaking soccer fans to international criminal organizations. As an example I reviewed the audience of H&M and here's how the locations of their followers map out: Affinio's affinity-based segmentation isolated a group of young fashion fans located in the Middle East with the majority of users located in Egypt Jordan Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. Most used terms in their tweets: Top 100 high-affinity accounts: Most used hashtags: I also segmented all of the Twitter users in Japan to get a better idea of how people in Japan are using Twitter. Affinio has the ability to filter users in any city state province territory or country - making it easy to dive into any regions interests and affinities.

Once segmented each tribe shares similar interests and affinities making language processing and content analysis a lot easier and more accurate because the context in which these terms are being used are known.

,151,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,151,http://www.affinio.com/blog/segmenting-tv-audiences-by-region-and-persona,Understanding TV Audiences by Region and Persona,Truly understanding the fanbase of a TV show or movie can be a real challenge. There are so many different types of fans each with their own interests and regional affinities. When marketing or selling commercial slots for a show understanding the many personas within the fanbase is critical to finding the people brands events and topics that truly matter to key audience segments. We used Affinio's ability to analyze 100% of a social audience to understand the key audience segments by location and interest profile. As an example we analyzed the followers of Game of Thrones in 3 regions and segmented the audiences of each into personas. After reviewing the various tribes within each audience we decided to compare the 3 tribes of 'Gamers' to show that even though you may come across similar people in each region the interests of each persona can differ dramatically between regions. Next we looked at the most relevant accounts to the members of the US UK and Canadian Gaming tribes and used Affinio’s “highlight unique” feature to extract the accounts that only mattered to gamers within a region. The accounts below are the top 20 accounts that are relevant to gamers in a given region that didn’t show up as relevant in the other regions. Example: You’ll notice that Andy McNamara (GI_AndyMc) is highly relevant to gamers in the United States but far less relevant to Canadian and UK based gamers. A Subset Of Unique Influential Accounts To American Gamers @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow A Subset Of Unique Influential Accounts To British Gamers @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow A Subset Of Unique Influential Accounts To Canadian Gamers @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow The data above shows that the gamers who love Game of Thrones also have different interests and affinities based on where they are located. When marketing the show (or selling sponsorship spots on the show) understanding the regional culture and the accounts that matter to each fan segment is key. In this example the difference between American gamers and their UK and Canadian counterparts is that they are influenced by Blair Herter and John Favreau stream games from GameFly watch Midnight on Comedy Central and also watch the NFL on ESPN and catch the highlights on Sportscenter. UK gamers get their games from GAME.co.uk or Amazon UK love Richard Hammond and Top Gear Frankie Boyle Jimmy Carr and are likely to follow or attend EGX the UK’s biggest video game event. Canadian gamers can be found at the Tim Hortons buying games at EB Games or Best Buy and watch the NHL and likely support the Toronto Maple Leafs. In addition to providing insights into the accounts brands people and retailers that gamers who love Game of Thrones care about in each region Affinio also provides insights into the content that matters most to them. Top Mentioned Accounts by GOT Gamer Fans (by region) Top Used Hashtags by GOT Gamer Fans (by region) Top Used Emojis by GOT Gamer Fans (by region) Mention hashtag and even emoji usage within the gamer tribes varies region to region further highlighting that each tribe although all 'Gamers' have their own unique interests affinities conversations and content. Segmenting a show’s audience to gain a holistic psychographic view of the many tribes that watch it is critical when it comes to media planning and ad buys.

,154,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,154,http://www.affinio.com/blog/social-data-shows-the-power-of-rugby-for-brands,Social Data Shows The Power of Rugby for Brands,The Rugby World Cup is upon us much to the joy of rugby fans across the world. The sport has come far. In the 1970´s and 80´s while some of the greatest proponents of the game graced the field the business side of Rugby Union was in its infancy. Players were amateur in status and fitness conditioning usually meant choosing an orange over a cigarette at halftime. International games could be amazing or dull and frequently would descend into a violence filled mud bath as players struggled to overcome the British weather’s affect on poorly maintained pitches. In 1987 the inaugural World Cup took place in New Zealand & Australia and was won by the iconic All Blacks. Since that tournament rugby has gone through a transformation making it into one of the most bankable sports sponsorship platforms in the world. Revenue for Rugby World Cup Tournaments But who are the rugby fans? What do they like and why are they so valuable to brands? At Affinio we decided to find out. Firstly we looked at the followers of the Rugby World Cup Tournament. The account @RugbyWorldCup has nearly 400k followers the vast majority of which (over 87%) are inactive users of Twitter. Using Affinio’s award winning technology we are able to see the whole audience by their social graph ie. who and what they connect to on Twitter. As you would expect there are some groupings and tribes against nationalities. English and New Zealand Rugby dominate but the growing popularity of the sport in Argentina and their increased prowess in the World game sees their followers becoming a growing tribe amongst rugby’s elite. The new professional athletes are starting to encroach on football's pop culture as well with tribes of Directioners (that’s One Direction fans for those of a certain age) and Pop Culture tribes seeing a significant percentage of the overall audience as well. When we start to look at the interests of each tribe we can see why brands and advertisers want to get in on the World Cup and engage with this audience.You can see in the examples below how Rugby fans have a strong affinity with certain brands Canterbury is a rather obvious example being the biggest rugby brand in the world but real insight comes when we delve into the tribes and look at their favourite brands. English fans have a huge affinity with Dove a national team partner. The affinity score of 2024 means that the English fans tribe is 2024 times more likely to follow this account than the rest of Twitter because they have a connection to it. Likewise Bank of Ireland for the Irish fans and Samsung for the South Africans. These are brands that have made a significant investment in the sport and the figures here suggest it is paying off for them at least in terms of brand affinity. To compliment this report we also ran an analysis of @EnglandRugby fans and found some really interesting niche tribes there. Over 5% of the followers of this account had an affinity to Cycling. This audience were proactive tweeters and had a completely different graph to the other audiences. They followed professional cyclists and had a high affinity to cycling brands across the board. There are huge opportunities for brands in Rugby and Affinio has illuminated some new ones. We have only scraped the surface of the power of International Rugby and the World Cup there is so much more out there to look at and profit from. Our reports show that Rugby Fans are not just ex-public school oiks who wear khaki trousers and rugby tops. There is a real diversity here Pop Music fans to Cycling fans to Football fans all of whom have a common interest in Rugby. Brands now have the ability not only to be visible to a Rugby audience but also to potentially connect with them in much more relevant ways. Come on Ireland!!!!!!,Philip Macartney,September 17 2015

,156,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,156,http://www.affinio.com/blog/how-to-identify-personas-social-affinity,How to identify buying personas through Social Affinity,Creating buyer personas is a critical part of a successful content strategy. The personas you generate represent your ideal buyer and help you understand your customers on a more personal level. The more you know about your ideal customer the more likely you are to create content that will catch their attention and resonate with them. The ideal process for developing a buyer persona is disputed but they all start with analyzing your current customers and building fictional personas based on them. While this is a good process for small companies it becomes more difficult once you have thousands of customers. The challenge is building accurate buyer personas that represent the various customers you really have not assumed iterations of them based on a very small subset of all the data that's available for your audience. To address this segmenting your social audience into tribes of like-minded people is the ideal way to understand who your various customer segments are and the things they care about most. It's important to analyze 100% of your social audience to ensure you are learning about everyone not just the vocal minority that actively mention or engage with your content. To do this you need to develop a social DNA profile for every single audience member then group them with like-minded people who fit the same buyer persona. Once this is done you'll be able to measure the scale of each persona within your audience and then dive deep into the interests affinities and ultimately culture of your customer. Example As an example we segmented the audience of Red Bull on both Twitter and Instagram to show what a segmentation on 4.2 million people looks like.

,158,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,158,http://www.affinio.com/blog/martech-day-1-whos-in-the-audience,MarTech Day 1 - Who's in the audience?,Today marks the first day of the two-day #MarTech Conference being held in San Francisco. MarTech is in it's second year bringing top names to people in the Marketing Technology world. The conference is built around "understanding the breadth of marketing technology and how organizations can effectively integrate them into their marketing strategy and operations." Last year Scott Brinker - Co-Founder and CTO of Ion Interactive and the author of the Chief Marketing Technologist blog - stated that there were 947 marketing technology companies and believes that this number will increase to nearly 2000 this year. To see what this landscape looks like check out ChiefMartec.com's Infographic Affinio lives in this landscape so I thought it would be fun to demonstrate how using a marketing technology platform can benefit your organization using the MarTech Conference as an example. Product plug: Affinio's social-affinity engine helps brands discover social audiences they didn't even know existed. Unlike social monitoring or listening technologies that only analyze the small percentage of social engagers Affinio mines billions of social network connections to reveal the passions and interests of a brand's entire audience even the silent majority "lurkers". These insights help market researchers planners and strategists develop the most highly-targeted social campaigns possible. For the MarTech Conference we are giving access to demo accounts and offering attendees a FREE Report - Follow this link to run your own audience analysis. Let's find out more about the @MarTechConf audience and what actionable insights exist through analyzing the Social DNA of members within the audience. The graph above is showing the different segments of the @MartechConf audience and how they are related. I would say based on these communities (or tribes) that they are attracting their target audience. Out of interest I ran an initial audience analysis back on February 19th and then again today to analyze how the audience segmentations changed as we neared the big event. In this post I'll look at the audience as a whole. Later I'll break down a couple tribes to learn more about why they might be interested in attending the MarTech conference. Below is a representation of engagement within the total @Martechconf audience. This is a highly engaged audience - a normal Lurker percentage is closer to 80-90%. This audience is also unique in the fact that within the tribes they have high shared interests and many of the tribes are highly interconnected suggesting that they know each other in some way and have a lot in common. So we know that the communities within the audience have a lot in common and that they engage more often than average. But what are they talking about? Below you'll see the top hashtags and mentions used by this audience as a whole - the colours coordinate with the communities listed in the above graphics. To learn more about what the audience finds interesting or relevant here are the top 10 links shared by members of the @MarTechConf audience: SMX Advanced Seattle 2015: Rates and Registration SMX West 2015 Speaker Presentations Intelligent Context: CODB Optimizing a Career with Marketing Technology Why Demand Gen Marketers Need to Automate Media Partner Management Customer Knowledge Is Power For Your Marketing Career Five9 Builds a Better Demand Engine Why Facebook Buying TheFind Could Be Huge For Retailers And Facebook 12 Common Misconceptions about Marketing with Video Technology ROI starts with a win-win Below is the top 200 accounts that this audience has high affinity to: Click image to download list of 200 accounts Among all of these very recognizable accounts in the Digital Marketing world the top 20 accounts are: Finally the graph below is showing growth of @MartechConf over a time period of Feb 19th 2015 to today. As you can see the tribe that grew the most was the 'general followers' by 35% followed by "VP/Founder/Entrepreneur" at 28% "Business/Tech/Communication" at 24% and "B2B/Marketing Automation" at 22% with the smallest growth being in the SEO tribe. These insights give us an overview of who the audience of @MarTechConf is and what they are interested in. This information gives you a great starting point in understanding the people that are interested in a brand on a much deeper level. The next step would be diving into each of these communities and learning more about their culture how they communicate and what's important to them. Armed with this data you are able to build data-driven buyer personas content strategy media plan and create messaging that truly resonates.

,159,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,159,http://www.affinio.com/blog/whos-reading-your-content-and-what-should-they-read-next,How To Uncover The "People Layer" Of Your Content,Identifying the personas that are actively reading (and sharing) content from a site has always been the holy grail of content marketing. Pixel and cookie tracking tools have tried to surface this data but all they’ve been able to do is map traffic patterns and provide non-personal demographic data. Knowing very little about your readers makes content marketing a challenge. What are they passionate about? What other content are they engaging with? Why does one article resonate with them when another doesn’t? Without a deep understanding of who your readers are how can you build content that is useful? Understanding your audience through segmentation has been something that SEO Strategists and leading Content Marketers have talked about for years. Segmenting your target audience leaves you with different types of people to market to. They have different problems for different reasons. This leads to the development of buyer personas. For each segment creating a persona gives you a guideline of how to market to this group of people how you solve their unique problems. Creating personas "personifies" your audience adding the actionable 'People layer'. How do you uncover the "People Layer" of your content? We’ve studied this problem in depth and have developed a unique way to identify the personas of your readers based on their interests and affinities and then map out the content brands influencers and domains that mattered most to each persona. Our technology allows marketers and advertisers to truly understand the different personas/segments reading their content empowering data-driven content amplification targeted sponsored and native content and high-affinity guest blogs. Our friend Jay Baer provided some compelling use cases of this data in a recent post. To demonstrate our technology we analyzed everyone who shared any Ad Age article over the past 30 days and then broke them into personas based on their interests and affinities. To do this we used our partnership with GNIP to analyze everyone who shared an article that contained “adage” in the URL. Affinio and GNIP found 29306 people who shared at least 1 link containing “adage” in the URL in the past 30 days and then segmented them into 10 audience segments (we call them tribes): Personas found within Ad Age viewers: Within each of the personas found reading Ad Age Affinio analyzed extracted and compiled an in-depth psychographic profile of each audience segment. This approach allows marketers and publishers to truly understand who’s in an audience. As an example here’s a breakdown of 3 tribes found to be reading and sharing Ad Age content: Startups Tribe: Top used bio keywords: Locations of tribe members: Accounts this tribe finds most relevant: @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow Top used hashtags by tribe members: Top 10 articles shared by Startup tribe members: IAB Explores Its Options to Fight Ad Blockers Including Lawsuits Forget about the mobile internet IAB Says HTML5 Is New Standard Adobe Agrees 16 Startup Metrics With Retooled Atlas Under the Hood Facebook Closes in on Linking Ads to Sales Across Devices Hulu to Open a Private Ad Exchange Powered by Facebook's LiveRail Why Growth Hacking Is the Next Big Thing for Marketing Apple Eyes Move Into Original Programming (EXCLUSIVE) Mobile Readers Abound; the Ads Not So Much Google and Twitter Team Up to Offer Their Own 'Instant Articles' - With a Twist Creative Director & Designer Tribe: Top used bio keywords: Locations of tribe members: Accounts this tribe finds most relevant: @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow Top used hashtags by tribe members: Top 10 articles shared by Creative Director & Designer tribe members: Let's Try That Goodbye to Andrew Keller Again The Year's 32 Best Media Plans From Always and Nike to Oreo and Taco Bell What You've Been Told About Millennials Is (Mostly) Wrong How Instagram Is Changing the Way Brands Look at Photography Online and Beyond Not Just Millennials: Consumers Want Experiences Not Things Here's What 22 Famous Logos Would Look Like If They Swapped Colors With Competitors Times New Roman Eyewear? Wieden & Kennedy Has Even More Typeface-Inspired Eyeglasses Reality Check: Working at an Agency Is a Pretty Good Life What Instagram's New Formats May Mean for Marketers Mueller and Lafferty push Germans and Northern Irish to verge of Euro Politics & News Tribe: Top used bio keywords: Locations of tribe members: Accounts this tribe finds most relevant: @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow Top used hashtags by tribe members: Top 10 articles shared by Politics & News tribe members: CNN Charging 40 Times Its Usual Price for Spots in Republican Debate Democrats to Kick Off Digital Voter Targeting Effort at Summer Meeting STOCKS SURGE DOW JUMPS 400: Here's what you need to know Lost California hiker survived 9 days with broken leg The synthetic marijuana trade is a multimillion-dollar industry Mueller and Lafferty push Germans and Northern Irish to verge of Euro Welcome - U.S. Freedom Army Donald Trump is now saying nice things about Rick Perry Crisis-hit Brazil unveils $17 bn austerity package 10 game-changing drug companies that are about to revolutionize how we treat illness By segmenting the readers of Ad Age into niche audiences based on their reading patterns and interests Affinio automatically found mapped and extracted insights on the 10 most active personas reading Ad Age. Why does this matter? Knowing the psychographic profiles of the various audience segments that read and engage with a sites content helps content creators build content that they know will resonate within key audience segments. It also helps publishers find key sponsors and advertisers similar to how Jay Baer is using Affinio to find sponsors for his podcast. Want to discover the “people layer” for your content?

How Santa Uses Data to Find His Audience,You better watch out you better not cry better not pout I'm telling you why… Yes Santa Claus is indeed coming to town. While most of you are putting on your Christmas jumpers and buying those last minute presents the elves here at Affinio have been working to help Santa on the run up to Christmas (we just want to stay off the naughty list). Papa Elf wanted to know who the big influencers were for Santa and the big man himself wanted to get some clues on what presents were going to work this Christmas. Affinio put on their elf costumes and got to work…. We looked at the real Santa believers the people following Santa (he has a number of accounts - @SantaClaus  @officialSanta  @Santa  @Santa_Claus)  he just seems to like Twitter a lot. We ran a report on all of these channels and we found a new list for Santa. Sixteen tribes formed out of the combined audiences and the most prominent one was UK Pop Culture. It seems the Brits are the ones most likely to follow Santa with the Americans in second place. Santa was particularly interested in a few Tribes that caught his eye - US Christmas Fans and Christmas Geeks he described them as “his kind of people”. Though from a strictly data led point of view we liked the YouTubers they were the most engaged Tribe by far. Tribe Tweets Per Month Santa and Papa Elf were adamant that they wanted to drill down more into the Christmas Fan Tribes so we duly obliged. US Christmas Fans are dominated by Christmas countdown and Santa channels. They are obsessed with the run up to Christmas and their graph illustrates it well. Santa before Obama snowman before Demi Lovato they are all about the festive spirit. Here are their Top 100 Followed Channels: Christmas even comes up first in their Bio data: The Christmas Geek tribe definitely gets to the top of Santa’s list because look who is at the top of their Bio data: We also looked at what they were talking about and who they were mentioning no surprises really: Santa is a bit of a Twitter fan and his Marketing Elves were really interested to know about the content these Tribes were sharing and creating. They wanted to see what was interesting to these Tribes in order to engage with them in a much more relevant way. It seems the Christmas fans are pretty simple in the run up to Christmas... they only post Christmas stuff! So the final part of our presentation in a cold boardroom at the North Pole was to show Santa and his vertically challenged staff insight into the most important thing about Christmas….the presents. What brands were most important to the Christmas Crazy Tribes: It looks like its gaming and tech all the way for the guys at the top of Santa’s list this year. Nothing says Christmas like Grand Theft Auto V. Santa was one of our best clients but unfortunately he tends to go very quiet for 11 months of the year and his offices aren’t exactly handy. Still at least we aren’t on the naughty list this year. Merry Christmas everybody!!!,Philip Macartney,December 23 2015

Solution SHIFT a Twitter Tailored Audience partner teamed up with Affinio to identify optimize and engage with the client’s ideal target audience. Affinio used its graph engine and advanced machine learning to analyze billions of network connections Twitter bio details public lists images and conversations - all in real-time - to find specific users that would likely engage with the film’s Twitter content. Based on these findings a test campaign was launched using SHIFT’s Twitter ads solution. The SHIFT team then analyzed these results and worked with Affinio to quickly refine the targeting criteria and launch the live Promoted Tweets campaign through SHIFT’s Twitter ads solution. Results Speed of optimization through SHIFT’s Twitter ads solution coupled with the award-winning big data predictive skills of Affinio led to a campaign engagement rate that was nearly 5x the entertainment benchmark average. This was largely driven by early analysis and optimizations which helped increase engagement rates by over 83% from initial tests - final results can be seen below. The strong engagement rate serves as evidence that the targeting approach was a success and contributed to the film earning first place at the box office its opening weekend. Note: Entertainment campaigns with promoted tweets typically have a 3-5% engagement rate.,Brian,June 09 2014
,163,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,163,http://www.affinio.com/blog/meerkat-what-a-great-sxsw-launch-gets-you,Meerkat: What a great SXSW launch gets you,Every year thousands of startups (including Affinio) flock to SXSW with the dream of blowing the minds of the tech and marketing elite and then launching into the stratosphere with insane traction and an obscene valuation. When on the ground at SXSW the goal is to meet cool people onboard tons of new users get featured by the world's press and become the coolest new thing on the internet. Although we were really happy with the reception Affinio received at SXSW the glowing star of the show was definitely Meerkat. Meerkat (@appmeerkat) launched just before SXSW and was by far the most talked about app/startup/thing during the interactive festival. They've reported an increase in the user base by 100% in the first 3 days and even had major celebrities jumping on board to test it out. While all of this traction is great who is it with? Who are these early adopters and will Meerkat be able to break through the initial users at SXSW and reach a broader more mainstream user base? To start I used Affinio to segment the followers of (@appmeerkat) into tribes of like-minded people. The goal of this was to identify the different personas following (and potentially using) the product. It's important to note that the segmentation is based on the users social and interest graphs so we are able to analyzed 100% of the follower base not just vocal minority who may have tweeted about or mentioned Meerkat. The illustrations below represent all the tribes we found within the audience of Meerkat as well as the audience of SXSW for comparison. We define a tribe as people with high affinity to one another so it's easiest to think of tribes as groups of people (or personas) who all share the same psychographic profile. After reviewing the tribes within the audience of Meerkat it became clear they were very similar to the tribes we found within the audience of SXSW which is not surprising given the fact that Meerkat had a large presence at SXSW. What was surprising is the traction Meerkat is getting in Europe. I found three distinct tribes of followers located in Germany Switzerland and the Netherlands. Followers of Meerkat: Followers of SXSW: Key influencers of the followers of Meerkat on Twitter: Leaderboard on Meerkat: As you can see many of the top users of Meerkat are also top influencers of the followers of @appmeerkat on Twitter and include major marketing and tech names such as Gary Vaynerchuk Kevin Rose Mashable and Guy Kawasaki. What does this mean? It certainly validates that if you are looking to make a major splash in the tech and marketing world SXSW is a perfect venue to do so - but there is a catch. To gain traction at SXSW you need to be adding immediate value to new users attending the event. Meerkat was able to spread because it enabled attendees to share their SXSW experience with the world in real time in a fresh novel and compelling way. These experiences also attracted new users from Twitter and pulled new users into the app creating a nice growth engine of see stream create account create stream repeat. TLDR: If you are a product/service that can add immediate value to tech/startup users at SXSW and attract new users by helping existing users share key stories and events - you (like Meerkat) should really consider making SXSW a key part of your go to market strategy.,Brian,March 19 2015
,164,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,164,http://www.affinio.com/blog/whos-going-to-feed-the-next-billion-meet-the-future-farmers-tasked-to-feed-us-all,Who's going to feed the next 2 Billion? Meet the farmers of tomorrow,PHOTOGRAPH BY GEORGE STEINMETZ According to a top scientist at the U.S. Agency for International Development the world is less than 40 years away from a food shortage which will have serious implications for both people and governments. With the global population well on its way to reaching 9 billion a 70 percent increase in food is needed to meet the demand and ensure proper nutrition for everyone around the world. This is a daunting task and it’s up to the next generation of farmers to develop the processes and systems needed to create efficient farming the scales. The FFA (Future Farmers of America) is an organization for students interested in agriculture and leadership. The agricultural students of today are growing into the farmers needed to supply the 9+ Billion mouths in the world of tomorrow. The process behind how the post came to be started with an audience audit of the followers of @MonsantoCo on Twitter. Monsanto is a multinational agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology company that is regularly in the news due to the genetically engineered seeds and other products they produce. Monsanto has 67259 followers on Twitter and using Affinio this audience was segmented into the following tribes: Inside this audience we found a variety of audience segments (we call them tribes) that all shared similar interests and affinities. When the Monsanto report was generated the FFA was not on our radar nor were the types of people who would be inside the FFA tribe within John Deere’s audience. When the report was created Affinio’s algorithms analyzed everyone in the social audience and found naturally occurring tribes within the Monsanto audience. This means that we were able to dig in and explore all sorts of hidden niche audiences even though we had no idea they even existed within an audience 2 hours earlier. This FFA tribe of people helped us uncover some really great insights into members of the FFA. The only issue with this tribe is that they all followed Monsanto (because that was the original report seed). To ensure we were learning from as many FFA members as possible (and not just John Deere fans within the FFA) we used Affinio’s lookalike modelling to find everyone else on twitter who matched the same interest and affinity profile as the members of the FFA tribe. This allowed us to find members of the FFA who didn’t follow Monsanto and helped us map and analyze FFA members as well as anyone else on Twitter with high affinity to the FFA. Once the lookalike was complete the modelling found 37274 people with high-affinity to the FFA. Here are the tribes this audience extension segmented into: You’ll notice that the largest tribe within this audience is a tribe of FFA members and staff which made up 13% of the audience extension. The other 87% consists of all the peripheral organizations and people that members of the FFA would interface with. This essentially maps the entire world of a FFA member allowing a researcher with zero agricultural knowledge to dig deep into the industry and learn about all the topics accounts thought leaders and content within each niche. To help illustrate the depth of insights Affinio provides here’s a breakdown of the Cattle farmer tribe found within the audience extension of FFA tribe members. Example: Cattle farmers We were able to find a tribe of 3724 Cattle farmers within the FFA audience extension report. How can we confirm they are cattle farmers? Well here’s how they self-describe: And here are the top 100 most relevant accounts to them on Twitter. These accounts were generated by looking at every account anyone in this audience followed then using our niche ranking algorithm we calculated which ones are most relevant to the tribe members. This ensures you are able to identify accounts that truly matter to tribe members rather than massive accounts such as celebrities that tribe members may follow. Top 100 relevant accounts to cattle farmers: Top used hashtags by these tribe members include: When researching an audience understanding the accounts and content that matters most to them is critical. Mapping accounts and topics allows marketers and researchers to get inside the mind of their target customer to truly understand their psychographic makeup. A great place to start this research is to review the top shared content by an audience (in this case cattle farmers). Unlike global trend or keyword filters Affinio reviews the last 30 days to find the links and content that mattered the most to real cattle farmers. This ensures that you aren’t extracting insights and researching content that matters to a lot of people but of the types of people that matter to you. Top shared links: Download Cow Calf Today!

(Norm's Twitter profile - not exactly the kind of person you'd expect to see in a rap feud) Norm's involvement in the Drake vs. Meek Mill beef started when he tweeted at Meek Mill to let the rapper know he was no longer welcome in Toronto due to comments he made about a fellow Toronto native Drake. Drake was accused by Meek Mill of being a fraud for not writing his own raps something that offended Drake Norm and countless others. As a city councillor Norm stuck up for his fellow Torontonian on Twitter and started the most bizarre and entertaining spree of interactions between a Canadian politician and rap superstars by far. Before we dive too far into the data it's important to know the process behind this post as the original plan wasn't to write about Norm at all (we didn't even know Norm existed but we're glad we do now). This post originally started as a follow-up to an earlier piece on Drake vs Meek Mill. We used Affinio’s partnership with GNIP to analyze anyone who mentioned #DrakevsMeek (or related hashtags) with the goal of better understanding the various personas discussing the feud. While those insights were interesting the most compelling insight of all was just how important Norm Kelly had become within this whole feud. After reviewing the data Kelly was responsible for 5 of the top 20 favorited tweets and was the 14th most mentioned account by the 170094 unique users who mentioned the battle.

Here’s a breakdown of Norms current social audience with labeled tribes vs his audience at 20K. Norm's Twitter audience before the beef: Norm's Twitter audience after the beef: % of youth in audience pre/post beef: Norm has done more to target young voters with a few targeted tweets than many politicians do in their entire careers. Using Twitter he's connected with and attracted thousands of young people and redefined what a government figure could be to them. He's stepped across cultural boundaries and shown a clear understanding and enjoyment for a culture that's traditionally been rejected and villainized by politicians. All of this shows that Norm is the clear winner in this rap beef and that both Meek Mill and Drake need to show their respect.,Brian,August 05 2015
,167,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,167,http://www.affinio.com/blog/three-reasons-why-social-dna-will-power-the-future-of-marketing,Three reasons why Social DNA will power the future of marketing,A person's Social DNA ™ is comprised of their interests affinities and social connections. These attributes extracted from a user's social and interest graphs create a holistic highly detailed picture of who a person is and the things they care about most. These insights help marketers build data-driven personas develop highly engaging and relevant content and identify which media channels are the most effective for a specific audience. The key to developing a Social DNA ™ profile for a user is the ability to work with the relational and interest graphs of a social network. Due to their scale these graphs are extremely complex to work with and requires powerful technology to extract meaningful and accurate insights. Affinio's Strata Hadoop award-winning technology gives us the ability to do this and we are the leaders of graph-based social insights on Twitter Instagram and Pinterest. Our customers use our Social DNA-based insights to gain a previously impossible view into the worlds of their customers to understand them on a deeper level. 1. Coverage The value of this graph-based approach is clear once you take into consideration the existing methods for gathering insights from social data. Most social insight tools are only able to extract insights from tweet or post data and they do this by setting up complex filters to find people mentioning a specific keyword. Once a keyword is detected the person who used it is included in the audience analysis and attempts are made using language processing to determine the demographic and sentiment of the user. We can get valuable insights from monitoring what people are saying the problem is that it ignores the silent majority of your audience. Example: This is the engagement breakdown of people who follow Nike Running on Twitter: The following is a representation of the mention graph of the followers of Nike Running. This looks at the 17.14% of users who are actively tweeting within the follower base. It's important to note that this is the % of an audience that existing tools monitor and this is assuming that all of these tweets contain the exact phrases your tool is monitoring. The image below is the network graph of the followers of Nike Running. Every single person in an audience is being analyzed even if they've never tweeted before. This is possible because we can extract insights on who they are and what they are interested in by reviewing their social connections. The graphs above highlight the importance of using social graph data to capture insights from an entire social audience rather than the small subset that engages vocally. When researching social audiences it's critical to be reviewing the interests and affinities of everyone not just the vocal minority who tweet often to ensure you are accurately understanding the total population. 2. Context While audience coverage is an important reason to use graph-based insights it's not the only benefit. Another core reason to use graph data is the context of the insight. With mention data you have no idea who the person tweeting or posting is which makes it hard to assess the value of the person and if their opinion/comment/feedback truly matters to your business. Knowing who a person is and their potential value to your company is easy when you know their Social DNA ™ profile as you are able to quickly and easily determine the potential value of a social user by comparing them to your ideal customers. Example: To increase the effectiveness of our community management and social monitoring team we built an internal tool to measure the Social DNA ™ of anyone and then compare it to that of our ideal customer. This allows us to filter all social mentions prioritizing replies to users with a high affinity to buy or become a customer. It also allows us to craft personalized replies that we know will resonate because we're able to use their Social DNA ™ profile to inform us on their interests and affinities. We've also built this functionality into a chrome extension which allows us to measure the affinity of anyone to anything on any web page. This has been a big hit internally as it means our marketing team doesn't have to leave the page or product they are using to map a user's affinity to our ideal customer. How it works: Users select the tribe or persona they want to measure social users to from the Affinio platform then the plugin scores any user on that page to the ideal Social DNA ™ profile of the selected tribe. This allows you to build custom targets to meet your needs then score any user to them. 3. Targeting Affinio is able to create lists of high-affinity users to any topic or persona allowing advertisers to place the right ad to the right person with the right messaging. We do this by analyzing the Social DNA ™ profile of everyone on a specific network then when a user selects a specific tribe or persona to target we go out and build a custom list of people that have high affinity to that Social DNA ™ profile. Example: Let's say you wanted to place highly target ads to people who are interested in marathons. Existing targeting methods might help you place ads to athletic people or people who mention marathons but we all know that just because you follow @nikerunning it doesn't mean that you'll run a marathon. Keyword-based targeting will also cause issues as a user may post something like "least weekend was a marathon of Netflix" but it's safe to assume that this user isn't interested in running a marathon either. By using the social and interest graphs to develop a Social DNA ™ profile for every user we are able to cut through the noise and only target people who have an affinity to marathons and these people would be likely be interested in the following accounts: By analyzing the relational connections of users we can compile a highly targeted Social DNA-based list that ensures you won't fall into the trap of targeting people through false positives. Full audience coverage affinity-based social listening and highly targeted ads are among the many reasons that Social DNA ™ is the future of marketing and advertising.

,169,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,169,http://www.affinio.com/blog/3-data-driven-reasons-why-kanye-and-dame-should-buy-karmaloop,3 data driven reasons why Kanye and Dame need Karmaloop,The internet is blowing up after Kanye and Dame Dash posted an Instagram video stating they are going to buy Karmaloop the online streetwear fashion retail giant. In response Karmaloop and its CEO Greg Selkoe issued the following statement to Four Pins: "As we confirmed earlier this week Kanye and Dame are among several people we've spoken with about Karmaloop. We're having a lot of conversations and seeing intense interest in our brand." Despite strong revenues ($165M in 2013) and a large consumer base rumoured to be north of 1M Karmaloop has failed to keep cash flowing and has recently filed for bankruptcy and is looking for a quick sale to help bail them out. With Karmaloop in desperate need of a miracle will (and should) Yeezus and Dash make it rain to bring them back from the dead? 1. Customer Data Kanye’s latest mission is to make style and fashion accessible for everyone regardless of income or social class. To help execute on this ambitious plan Kanye partnered with Adidas a deal that gives him the product and manufacturing teams needed to make inexpensive stylish garments at scale. While this deal gives him the ability to flood the world with new clothing it still requires Kanye to fill the pipeline with the right designs at the right times for the right customer segments. If Kanye and Dame buy Karmaloop they will gain access to the purchase history of a large sample of their ideal customers. At last year’s Dreamforce Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff preached “know your customer and be ready to greet them.” Being ready to greet your customers with exactly the experience they want requires an in-depth understanding of who your customers are and what they care about most. Karmaloop’s CRM contains the data Kanye and Dame would need to segment their ideal customers intro niche groups and analyze how taste style and culture evolve over time. Think of Karmaloop’s customer database as the ultimate hive mind of streetwear and fast fashion giving Kanye a detailed cheat sheet into what looks are hot and with who. He could then develop niche specific pieces and lines that he knows will likely sell then promote them to the exact people who he knows have high affinity to buy them. 2. The correct customers + audience Having CRM data is great but having the correct CRM data is better. Although I don’t have access to Karmaloop’s CRM I can use Affinio to segment and analyze their social audience of half a million Twitter followers to better understand the types of customers they have. CRM data provides the purchase history and buying patterns of customers but it’s pretty useless when it comes to mapping and understanding the culture of your customers. Social data however provides a much more detailed look into the culture and psychographics of a consumer base. It’s becoming possible to link CRM and social data together making it easier to understand the various customer segments you have and the psychographics and culture of each. To better understand Karmaloop's customers I started by segmenting their 497018 followers into tribes of like-minded people based on their interests and affinities. Affinio’s algorithms found 18 distinct tribes (visualized below) and provided insights on the interests and affinities of each. Kanye needs to focus his efforts on becoming highly respected in both the streetwear and fashion worlds so I found the two tribes that best represented each consumer base and dug into them. Tribes within Karmaloops Audience: Each color represents a unique customer segment These two tribes (detailed breakdown below) are the engine behind fashion and streetwear and act much like the mob did in ancient Rome. Designers need their collections to be well-received shared and discussed by members of these tribes to ensure they are driving enough traffic to their launches. Style.com recently stated Kanye’s line had more traffic than Chanel’s the first person to do so since Style.com started recording this data back in 2011. This is a great start for Kanye but he needs to keep up this momentum and win over both tribes for his fashion vision to succeed. To better understand the members of these tribes I broke both of them down below to give you an idea of their affinities interests topics and content.

One side knows the runway and the other knows the streets - exactly the two worlds Kanye is trying to bridge. 3. Distribution Style.com's coverage of the Kanye West x Adidas Originals show received 4578461 page views proving that Kanye has no trouble driving traffic. What's yet to be seen is how Kanye will convert that traffic into cash. Karmaloop (which has sold up to $2M in product in one day) could provide the infrastructure needed for Kanye to convert this traffic into sales. They have all the logistics and the team to do it figured out making it possible for Kanye to move hundreds of millions of dollars worth of product a year if the demand is there. It's clear that Karmaloop has the customers data and distribution that Kanye needs to take his plan for world fashion domination to the next level. If he can keep creating designs people love and if adidas can keep up with demand Karmaloop would provide ability to monetize and convert that traffic into sales. The question now is can Kanye and Dame put together a strong enough plan to bring Karmaloop back from the dead. Request a demo,Brian,March 30 2015
,170,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,170,http://www.affinio.com/blog/2015-b2b-digital-strategy-3-questions-dominic-canterbury,2015 B2B Digital Strategy: 3 Questions with Dominic Canterbury,We came across this great post by Dominic Canterbury and the team at Turbine B2B. The post quoted below explores key challenges facing B2B marketing teams in 2015 and highlights some of the main reasons why we built Affinio. Turbine B2B: What would you say is the biggest change in B2B sales and marketing in recent years? Dominic Canterbury: The biggest change we're seeing is in the Path to Purchase itself. Today's B2B buyers have taken control of the buying process in unprecedented ways. Rather than relying on companies and sales people to help inform buying decisions they're looking to the digital sphere to find all the information they need and only making contact with a company in the very final stages of the process. As a result today's B2B Path to Purchase is a complex journey with a whole lot of branches forks and loop-backs and companies are finding that if they don't connect at the earliest stages by being part of relevant digital conversations then it's unlikely they'll be there at the end. Like Dominic stated above sales is no longer a linear process. Prospects are sourcing information from many channels to help inform their decisions. Before Affinio we had another company that had tens of thousands of social followers and we wanted to dig into these followers to better understand the websites blogs articles posts and influencers that were informing our target customers. To do this we built our own custom graph engine and database to handle all the relational connections between our followers. Once we had this built we were able to segment our followers into groups (also known as tribes) of like minded people which allowed us to easily define and understand the many buyer persona's in our audience. Turbine: What's the most important thing a B2B can do today to improve their sales and marketing? Dominic: Understanding your audience is more important than ever before. But I'm not talking about understanding them on the level of demographics. Demographics are a relic of the Mass Marketing era and won't give you the insights you need. I'm talking about understanding how your audience thinks and feels and what drives them at each stage of the decision process - what makes them initiate the search and what information and advice they hope to find; what and who influences their opinions about the industry; what information and experiences would grab and hold their attention through the sales process and beyond. There are a lot of different approaches to getting these insights but once you have them your marketing plan practically writes itself. Our previous company was a wifi hotspot app that had a wide variety of users ranging from corporate sales teams to teens who wanted to use their laptop in the car. The diversity of our user base confused and diluted the results of the various audience insight tools we tried. To them our audience looked like a little bit of everyone ranging from ages 14-60 and they lacked the ability to segment them into tribes of like minded people for deeper analysis. We knew that the key to understanding an audience lied in understanding the psychographic profiles of the audience members rather than the demographic. With this in mind we built Affinio to segment any audience into different persona's then extract deep psychographic and cultural details on each. By presenting who these people are where they live what they like read share talk about and are influenced by marketers are able to use Affinio to understand the interests and affinities of their audience and create highly personalized targeted content that will truly matter. Turbine: How do you think B2B sales and marketing will change in 2015? Dominic: The changes we've seen lately are accelerating rapidly. Every year B2B customers move the decision process deeper into the digital spaces and away from direct contact with companies and sales people. To keep up B2B companies need to be prepared to engage prospects where they are now not where they were a few years back. And that means creating content that matters and authentically engaging in the conversations that shape their opinions. Affinio's tribal segmentation uncovers where your best prospects are and the things that matter most to them. This allows marketers to create data driven buyer personas rich with the psychographic details needed to create content and strategies that connect and convert. If the challenges outlined in this article resonate with you contact us for a demo as we'd love to share how we've helped B2B brands better understand and attract their ideal customers.

Actually it’s been an amazing year. Often times when everyone is heads-down and going full tilt you lose sight of all your accomplishments and sometimes the “big picture”. In preparation for our holiday party this year we asked everyone on our team to put together their “best of 2015” highlights. The lists that came back were amazing – and humbling for us all. We’ve come a long way in 2015 and spending some casual time together and reflecting on these amazing wins has gotten everyone on our team pumped up about what is to come in 2016. We wanted to share some of the exciting highlights from 2015 with you our customers colleagues and friends so you can share in our excitement. Your support of our Affinio team has enabled us to achieve what we have – so thank you all so much. So without further delay here are some of Affinio’s best highlights for 2015: Business Highlights We closed our Series A funding for $4 million led by Whitecap Venture Partners and Build Ventures. Read more about this milestone here. Sales Highlights Our SaaS monthly revenue increased by 1600%. We closed multiple ARR deals this year. We increased our customer list by 700% and welcomed some awesome customers including BBC Worldwide L’Oreal and Sony Music. We expanded our field sales team to tackle EMEA and US markets. Product Highlights We added Instagram and Pinterest reports to our platform. We added GNIP integration to enable mention-based reports. We successfully integrated with the Twitter Ads API. Features such as Admin Report folders in-app notifications and PDF exports were added to our platform. An Owned/Targeted assets feature was added to track specific accounts in a report. We built an indexed storage of the decahose (only to have Amazon release it the next week for free!) We developed a fully-featured API for customers. We added Top Emojis into our reports! Interest categories were added to allow users to filter in the Interest tab. We added content analysis reports which allow customers to analyze the personas sharing content from a specific site. We had our first customers hit our API. Clustering technology advancements were able to reduce our report run times from 1+ hours to less than 60 seconds. Our “Discovery” app was launched after only a nine day build and received thousands of downloads within 48 hours. Team Highlights Our team more than doubled and grew to 20 with amazing additions including India Laura Ryan Dan Hannah Mike Michael Philip Justin Kyle Robbie and Andrew. Our Christmas party was way bigger than expected! One of our additions loved our product so much he became a customer-turned-employee! (He now runs our EMEA sales.) Phil managed to wake up before 8:00 a.m. instead of his usual 12:00 p.m. - 4:00 a.m. work schedule (although in fairness it was when he was in San Francisco.) Our cloud computing expert Quan managed to break the internet. (Yes this is possible!) Ardi’s dream came true and he got to build his sales team. John moved to NYC and ramped sales up in the Big Apple. India got to meet two of her idols (Jay Baer and Mark Schaefer!) Marketing Highlights David Boyle from BBC surprises us with a big shout out at the Strata + Hadoop World Big Data Conference in New York City. We published over 200 blog posts. Our monthly site traffic increased by 400%. Our marketing team grew by 300%. Other Important Highlights We discovered some of the most entertaining candles in the world - they are called Lotus Candles and if you don’t know what we mean watch it here! We moved offices for more space! Jimmy and Milo our office dogs finally started getting along and set aside their size differences. Sadly we had to end our “wins = cake” tradition for the sake of our health. …and that’s why we say 2015 has been such an amazing year. With the closing of our Series A funding 2016 is going to be an even bigger year for us with plans to triple our team and continue to grow our revenue! Sound like fun? Interested in joining us on our journey into 2016? We’re looking for self-motivated driven passionate people with great senses of humour for our dev marketing sales support and training teams.

In 1908 Barbour started using mail order catalogues to increase awareness and by 1917 the catalogue accounted for almost 75% of their orders and included buyers from places as far away as Chile South Africa and Hong Kong. Over 100 years later the brand is still going strong and they've taken to new more social channels such as Twitter Facebook and Instagram to attract and retain customers. This growth has resulted in a much wider and diverse consumer base than the Scottish fisherman they originally designed for. To better understand who the Barbour customer of today is we used Affinio to segmented the followers of Barbour on Instagram to find the various persona's within their audience. Tribes within Barbour's IG audience: UK Streetwear tribe: High-affinity accounts: Top used hashtags by UK streetwear tribe members: Accounts tagged in photos by UK streetwear tribe members: Comments by UK streetwear tribe members: Preppy southern US women: High-affinity accounts: Top used hashtags by preppy southern US women tribe members: Accounts tagged in photos by preppy southern US women tribe members: Comments by preppy southern US women tribe members: Designer men's fashion: High-affinity accounts: Top used hashtags by designer men's fashion tribe members: Accounts tagged in photos by designer men's fashion members: Comments by designer men's fashion tribe members: Bikers: High-affinity accounts: Top used hashtags by biker tribe members: Accounts tagged in photos by biker tribe members: Comments by biker tribe members: As the data above indicates Barbour has a large and diverse social audience that's creative cultured and cool. The expected persona of fashion and beauty contrasts well with tribes of bikers sneakerheads and preppy American women. Identifying and understanding these audience segments is key to developing effective and efficient marketing strategies. By knowing who's in a social audience and the things they care about most marketers are able to hone in on high-value segments and develop targeted content that they know will resonate.,Brian,July 07 2015

Personas allow you to be more strategic in catering to your client's audience allows your team to understand your target market and helps you to relate to them as human beings. Traditionally personas have been heavily based on demographics likely because this is the most readily available information. Developing a winning strategy requires more information about your target persona but not all of us have access to a full research team or the time to conduct in-depth studies. Affinio allows you to do a full social audience audit in a few hours to determine what personas currently exist in an audience (whether it's your client's or their competition). To demonstrate this we did an analysis of the @HerschelSupply audience on Twitter to further understand who their ideal buyer personas are.

Empathetic marketing focuses on understanding who a brand's customers are and why they want to buy from that brand. By understanding the emotions and motivations of a customer base brands can create content that connects on a deeply personal level. Mark Ingwer author of Empathetic Marketing defines the 6 core emotional needs of customers as: 1. Self-expression 2. Belonging 3. Recognition 4. Control 5. Care 6. Growths While the concept of understanding the emotional needs of customers sounds like an obvious goal for companies they’ve lacked the tools and processes to do this in an accurate and cost effective way. Traditionally the best way to do this was to go into the field and study thousands of customers in the environment where they either purchased or used the products. This process is both expensive and slow as it takes a long time to find meet interview and aggregate all of the insights into actionable strategies. Big data to the rescue At Affinio our goal is to allow you to understand any customer base in less than an hour without having to leave your desk. We are taking a process that previously took months and hundreds of thousands of dollars and replacing it with an easy to use product that not only extracts the insights but presents them in a easy to export powerpoint ready format. To do this we are leveraging award winning big data technology and an entirely new data source: the social graph. How it works We know that all customers aren’t created equal - they all have different interests needs and buying potential. The first step to understanding a customer base is to segment it into niche tribes. We define a tribe as a group of people who all share common interests affinities and values. Once a customer base has been segmented into tribes the next step it to create in depth persona’s for each tribe. To do this we mine the social graph to extract deep psychographic insights on who they are what they follow are influenced by talk about share mention and more. These insights are presented in a highly visual dashboard essentially generating a “moodboard” of each tribes entire world. Connecting on a personal level If brands want to serve the 6 core emotional needs defined by Ingwer they need to truly understand their customer base and the many tribes within. Affinio finds these tribes and extracts the psychographic insights that strategists need to truly understand and connect with their customers on a deeply personal level.

Relevance measures the amount of influence a given account has over an audience. It is scored by looking at the affinity account size and number of people in an audience who already follow that account. Example If a tribe of users on social media consists of 1000 people and they all follow an account that has 1000 followers (100% of followers are members of a tribe) then the account in question would have the maximum relevance possible for this tribe. If these same 1000 users also followed Barack Obama Barack's relevance to the tribe of 1000 people would be much lower due to the fact that he has 60M followers 59999000 of them who aren't inside of this tribe. Note that under most circumstances - affinity and relevance tend to trend in the same direction. Example: The probability that people would randomly follow an account with 1000 followers on Twitter is 1000/800M (VERY low) which means that if all 1000 tribe members followed an account that account's affinity to that tribe would be extremely high. What is social affinity? Social affinity looks at how likely a member of a specific audience is to follow a given account compared the rest of the users on the network. Why do these scores matter? Both relevance and affinity help you find and quantify which accounts matter most to a specific group of users. Use these insights to select the right influencers for a campaign find ideal brands and domains for media buys identify key media outlets and journalists and identify relevant brand partnerships. Example In the above image you can see that the members of this particular tribe are 756 times more likely to follow @Adweek compared to anyone else on twitter. It is also a very relevant account to this tribe with a score of 45.5/100. We know this is above average due to an audience 'relevance threshold' (found on Overview page) of 15/100.

,179,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,179,http://www.affinio.com/blog/forbes-defined-5-challenges-for-cmos-in-2015-heres-how-affinio-helps-with-all-of-them,Forbes defined 5 challenges for CMOs in 2015 here’s how Affinio helps with all of them,Forbes recently outlined what 2015 will look like for digital marketers and the CMOs that lead them. The article written by Gil Press highlights 5 things that CMOs need to address in 2015 based on observations by Scott Brinker a leading commentator on marketing technology Forrester TopRank online marketing blog Wheelhouse Advisors and Brian Solis. The top 5 things CMOs need to do in 2015: (and how Affinio will help them succeed.) 1. CMOs will take charge of focusing their companies on the customer What Forbes said: “CMOs and their marketing teams will become the primary driver behind customer-centric company growth. Leveraging their knowledge of the customer and the competitive landscape CMOs will advise and council CEOs on how to win serve and retain customers to grow the business." How Affinio helps: To do this successfully marketers need to have a deep understanding of their existing customers and the customers of their competitors. Unlike existing consumer insights tools Affinio is able to analyze entire social audiences and segment them into groups of like minded tribes. Once Affinio segments a customer base into tribes we extract detailed psychographic insights on each allowing marketers to dive deep into the culture of each customer segment to understand them on a deeply personal level. 2. CMOs will poach IT staff to help them manage a rapidly expanding digital marketing landscape What Forbes said: “The number of digital marketing tools will grow in 2015 with new startups and large established tech companies confusing even more that CMO with their numerous offerings. To help manage this embarrassment of riches and move their companies further on their digital marketing journey CMOs will be poaching IT staff looking for new challenges and better salaries.” How Affinio helps: Our goal is to save CMOs time and money not force them to hire technical teams to make their tools work. Affinio’s SaaS product has been designed to make collaboration reporting and data import/export as easy and visual as possible. By removing technical barriers we allow marketers to focus on what they do best (which usually isn’t coding!) 3. CMOs should expect heavy rains from proliferating digital marketing clouds (SaaS marketing tools) What Forbes said: “Digital marketing tools will be increasingly offered as a cloud-based solution (“marketing-as-a-service”) rather than licensed software. Cloud-based solutions will continue to expand their ecosystems with many small software developers adding apps to existing cloud-based digital marketing platforms.” How Affinio helps: Unlike other social tools which were designed for social monitoring and support Affinio has been designed with the digital campaign workflow in mind. As a SaaS tool our pricing scales for any project scope and organization size from consumer insights and research to media planning and campaign reporting. This along with daily weekly or monthly data updates ensures that CMOs and their teams have everything they need to learn adapt and execute on digital strategies in real time. 4. CMOs will invest in new digital marketing hot areas What Forbes said: “Content marketing and predictive analytics will continue to be hot areas of interest and investment for CMOs but they will be joined in 2015 by sales enablement post-sale customer marketing marketing finance marketing talent management and new tools based on the Internet of Things allowing for the integration of offline and online experiences.” How Affinio helps: Affinio spun out of a R&D lab that specialized in machine learning and has since become a leader in deep learning and predictive technologies. Our team has won big data awards and are leaders in content recommendation prediction and ad targeting. Please contact us for more information on our deep learning work. 5. CMOs will become brand publishers What Forbes said: “CMOs in 2015 will act as heads of a publishing house overseeing the entire spectrum of brand engagement increasing the quality of their output and improving the perceived value of digital interactions with customers and prospects.” How Affinio helps: CMOs are going to face a focus challenge when it comes to the creation and curation of content. Creating content that will attract and engage potential customers can only happen if marketers have a deep understanding of who their customers are. By segmenting a customer base into niche tribes Affinio can solve these focus issues by showing CMOs and their teams who their customers really are and the different types of content that truly resonate.

,180,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,180,http://www.affinio.com/blog/monitoring-the-nhl-draft-using-affinio,Monitoring the NHL Draft Using Affinio,“Today getting people to hear your story on social media and then act on it requires using a platform’s native language paying attention to context understanding the nuances and subtle differences that make each audience unique and adapting your content to match.” - Gary Vaynerchuk The sharpest brands know who is actually in their social audiences. They care about the psychographic segments that compose their social audiences and create content that speaks the language and knows the culture of these segments. This makes them successful because they are truly able to connect with their unique customers. However the culture of the moment changes so quickly. As news breaks articles are shared and audiences react even trusted norms can change in a matter of hours. Staying on top of these ever-changing audience nuances is a skill that is an intrinsic part of advertising life in the twenty-first century. Case Study: We monitored the official handle of the NHL Draft last weekend to understand who was following and how different segments of the audience reacted as players were selected hands were shaken and freshly curved team hats donned. Our analysis started the morning of the draft on Friday June 26. At this time @DraftNHL had 1724 followers and 6 unique tribes. The label of each tribe is defined by the theme of most relevant interests that the unique members of the tribe share. Tribe sizes: Tribe interests: The top 20 most relevant interests to people in each tribe. You notice that there are some overlaps between what members of each tribe choose to follow but certainly distinct themes of things that matter to the people that compose these unique tribes. NHL General News: NHL Players & Teams: Canadian Hockey Fans: Hockey Reporters: CHL & NCAA Hockey Fans: French Language Hockey News: Audience Changes: The highest audience growth took place during Friday evening. This was when the first round picks were selected. The NHL General News audience grew at the greatest velocity gaining 88 of the 123 new followers during the first round. After the first round no new growth happened in fact some people decided to stop following. On Saturday morning and the start of the second round audience growth resumed. Again the largest tribe NHL General News continued to grow the fastest but on the second day the CHL & NCAA Hockey Fan tribe began to grow at a much greater velocity than it had previously. This was likely due to supporters of these amature leagues tuning in to see if their hometown favorites we’re selected in the later rounds. Content: Early in the draft content focused around mainstream NHL topics and the big first round picks. Later in the draft as also highlighted by the tribe velocity growth content shifted to telling the stories of the lesser known draft picks and highlighting the leagues and journeys behind their stories. .,John,June 29 2015
,181,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,181,http://www.affinio.com/blog/gucci-mane-the-king-of-niche-content-marketing,Gucci Mane the king of niche content marketing,Radric Davis better known by his stage name Gucci Mane is an American rapper currently serving 36 months in jail for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Previously he served a month in prison for killing and burying a man behind a school after 4 armed robbers attempted to steal his chain. The killing later deemed self-defence set the tone for Gucci's music personality and rise to fame. He's known as the "Trap God" and his massive discography (28 Studio albums 3 EPs 12 Singles 45 Mixtapes) and 2.23M followers on Twitter show that his relentless work ethic and hustle have put him in a league of his own. Since his current prison term began he's released over 500 songs an unprecedented volume of work that has the internet wondering what he's got left in the vaults to release while he's still locked away.' .@gucci1017 is unstoppable! He's has released nearly 500 songs from prison: http://t.co/L1aQGgH9eP pic.twitter.com/bf7rUuIgD0 — XXL Magazine (@XXL) March 25 2015 .@gucci1017 just dropped three new albums: 'Breakfast' 'Lunch' and 'Dinner.' http://t.co/z5zNa2zF5C pic.twitter.com/H1JjCwJxo6 — Complex Music (@ComplexMusic) March 18 2015 @XXL @gucci1017 Must be bored as hell — Brian Medina (@BrianMediner) March 18 2015 There are brands who spend hundreds of millions a year on advertising and content that never reach the level of exposure or gain the respect Gucci Mane maintains from prison. The key to Gucci is he knows his audience and he's created a huge volume of high-quality niche content that keep his fans engaged and loyal. To better understand the massive audience Gucci Mane has developed and nurtured from prison I used Affinio to segment his audience into niche tribes of like-minded people and here's what I found: The first thing I noticed was the extremely high affinity within Gucci Mane's audience. When compared to the similar sized audiences of GoPro Pepsi and Skrillex it becomes obvious that Gucci's doing something different. His followers are the tightest most homogeneous group of fans we've ever seen in an audience of this size. This extremely high audience affinity highlights just how well he's able to attract a specific type of person. The heatmap below shows that his audience consists of a global network of loyal fans who all share similar interests affinities and culture. The photos below are the profile pictures of the top 200 high-affinity accounts to his followers on Twitter. This group consists of the who's who of hip-hop culture including the likes of 2 Chainz Drake Lil Wayne TI Meek Mill Wiz Khalifa and more. Gucci has also collaborated with most of the artists within this top 200 allowing him to cross promote himself to their audiences to bring in new high-affinity individuals to his fan base. Reviewing the top shared content in the last 30 days by his 2.3 Million followers makes it even more clear why pushing large volumes of content is key to growing a niche audience. The iTunes links to his 3 new albums and a link to download his free mixtape are 4 of the top 10 links shared by his 2.3 Million followers (and they were shared within this audience a combined 47423 times). Here are the 8 Gucci Mane related links that were among the top 20 links shared by his audience: The large volume of collaborations and free mixtapes he releases make his work easy to find and share decreasing the friction for new fans to learn about his work. He then drops paid albums into this stream of free content to monetize the fans that like his work most. This "freemium" approach ensures his music is always getting played somewhere by someone regardless if they want to support him financially or not. This constant flood of content keeps him top of mind in the rap game and it's been the engine that's enabled him to maintain relevance and niche dominance despite being locked up for years. If you want to grow a loyal high-affinity audience like Gucci Mane's you better understand the culture of your audience and create massive amounts of content that resonate with them.

,182,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,182,http://www.affinio.com/blog/context-and-psychographics-reinventing-social-media-monitoring-through-affinity,Context and Culture: Reinventing Social Media Monitoring through Affinity,Social listening and monitoring tools have revolutionized the way brands and agencies engage with their customers. They give you the ability to sift through millions of posts to find people who mentioned you a competitor a topic or just about anything else. While discovering people that mention key topics is great knowing who these people are and the things they care about most is better. Existing listening tools (Sysomos Crimson Hexagon Brandwatch etc) are unable to extract the deep psychographic insights needed to understand an audience on a personal level. While they measure the scale of a conversation they lack the data and technology needed to extract insights on the culture context or sentiment of the people having these conversations. To address these shortcomings Affinio has added the ability to import mention data from any listening platform and then run our segmentation and analysis on it. Affinio takes the mention data and segments everyone within it into niche tribes based on their interests and affinities. Once these tribes have been identified we extract psychographic and cultural insights on who the members of these tribes are. These insights include locations professions influencers trending content hashtags mentions topics and more - giving you the details needed to truly understand your audience. Sample As an example we took everyone who mentioned the Keystone XL pipeline project on Twitter between Oct 27th and Nov 26th 2014 and segmented them into niche tribes. We found that 21476 people mentioned the project and they belonged to 8 distinct tribes. By segmenting these mentions into tribes we were able to understand the different types of people on Twitter who are discussing the Keystone XL pipeline. Source: People who mentioned Keystone XL #keystone #keystonexl Keystone or Keystone Pipeline Date Range: 10.27.14 - 11.26.14 # of people: 21476 Tribes discovered: 8 Analyzing a tribe Once we've identified the key tribes discussing an issue we are able to drill into each to learn more about who they are and what they care about most. Bio Keywords Bio keywords are extracted from the user profiles of tribe members and provide insight on how people in this tribe self describe. Locations Locations are extracted from the user profiles of tribe members and show where a tribe is located. Niche Influencers These are the most influential accounts to the people within this tribe. Unlike other influencer tools our influencers are niche ranked for each tribe to ensure we only show you people relevant to this tribe. Hashtags Top used hashtags by the members of a tribe. Shared links & media Top shared content by the members of a tribe. By segmenting our mention data into niche tribes we were able to gain a much deeper understanding of the different types of people discussing the Keystone XL Pipeline. We were able to identify 8 distinct groups and dig deep into the culture influences and conversations of each.

Have you ever wondered who is using those hashtags? Is it all people in your profession? Perhaps they are 'outsiders' who are interested in what you do? We recently participated in a Collaborative Review of Social Media Research put on by #NewMR and GreenBook. The aim was to illustrate the benefits and strengths of social media research. Our focus was to find out who else was talking about Market Research other than Market Researches themselves. While going through the data we uncovered some fun facts about the #MRX community. Most Relevant Twitter Accounts to Market Researchers Top trending hashtags within the MRX community #marketresearch #newmr #mrx #mrmw #iiex #esomar Top favourited content within the MRX Community We have all heard the stories of 'Hashtag Fails' where someone or a brand uses a hashtag out of context - this can be disastrous. Context is extremely important when analyzing content. For our analysis we used Affinio to understand who was using the top 6 trending hashtags in the Market Research community (listed above). Along with a tribe of Market Researchers we also found some less obvious communities (Digital Marketers Designers and Students) who were using the hashtag in the context of Market Research. We also came across one large tribe who were not talk about research - far from it! Find out more in the study: "Who’s talking about market research other than market researchers?"

At tether we had a large social audience but struggled to understand the different types of users within it. We knew we could learn a lot about our customers by studying their social data but we lacked the tools needed to analyze and extract meaningful and actionable insights. As a start we compiled a list of the following needs and started looking for solutions. 1. Audience segmentation and insights 2. Influencer identification and measurement 3. Content discovery curation and recommendation 4. Targeted social advertisements 5. Targeted monitoring and social listening After testing hundreds of tools it became clear that we needed to make our own as nothing on the market solved our problems. 1. Audience segmentation and insights What we needed: We needed a tool to help us identify and understand the different types of people within our audience. We wanted to segment our audience into different niche persona’s (also known as tribes) so we could build and study buyer personas. What we found: Existing tools had basic filtering for things such as location gender demographic and sentiment - but we needed to go deeper. None of these tools allowed us to segment by social affinity or extract the psychographic details needed to build in depth buyer persona’s. What we built: We built award winning technology that analyzes massive social audiences and segments them into distinct tribes. It then reviews each tribe member and extracts the psychographic insights needed to construct detailed buyer persona’s. 2. Influencer identification and measurement: What we needed: We needed to find the websites blogs and people that our customers read and trust the most. In addition we wanted to find the niche influencers (under 50K followers) that had small but loyal audiences filled with educated potential customers. What we found Existing influencer tools aren’t mining the billions of relational connections needed to truly understand influence. As a substitute these technically weak influencer tools only use basic metrics such as follower counts and engagement levels to score influence. While they can find the major influencers (TechCrunch Mashable etc) all tools fell short when we wanted to find influencers within a tribe and at a certain account size. What we built We can select any group of people and find the most influential accounts to them. We can also filter by account size allowing us to control the scale of the influencers we want. 3. Content discovery curation and recommendation. What we needed: We needed to know what our customers talked about and shared the most so we could come up with better content strategies. What we found: We found a lot of tools that recommended or curated content on a key topic or industry. While this was great they didn’t allow us to use one of our custom buyer persona’s as a seed and find the content they cared about most. What we built: We built the ability to select any group of people and find the most shared content within that group. This allowed us to segment an audience into tribes then understand the topics links content and hashtags that matter most to each tribe. Unlike existing tools we show you everything that they share and mention not just the industry or topical content you used as an input when creating the search. 4. Targeted social advertisements What we needed: When we built our segmentation algorithm we wanted to be able to target everyone online who matched the same interest and affinity profile as the members of a tribe we found. What we found: Nothing What we built: We built our own lookalike technology that allows us to find and target everyone on social media that fits inside a certain interest profile. We do this by analyzing the social DNA of everyone and placing highly targeted ads to them. (This is how we sell Affinio and our cost per qualified lead is a fraction of what other channels are) 5. Targeted monitoring and social listening What we needed: We needed a social listening tool that filtered and scored people based on their affinity to our ideal buyer personas. When someone tweets as us we need to know if they matched the affinity profile of a customer or not. Once we matched a user to a buyer persona we could tailor our messaging to their needs and interests. What we found: Nothing. What we built: We built the ability to import listening data into Affinio for in depth segmentation and analysis. We consider this the first step to reinventing social monitoring and are really excited about how this will extend and grow in the new year. What’s next? 2014 was a big year for Affinio and 2015 is going to be even bigger. By working closely with some of the worlds best agencies and Fortune 500 brands we’ve been able to learn about the challenges facing the present and future of digital strategy. As a result we are responding in 2015 with the insights strategists need to be more predictive personalized and realtime with both content creation and distribution. We will also be adding new networks such as tumblr youtube and vine to ensure strategists have a holistic view of their audience. Request a demo,Brian,December 22 2014

Existing social media tools help you understand how many likes followers and impressions your content is earning. The problem with these tools is that they assume that all follows or likes are of equal value to a brand and do nothing to help you understand the types of people your content is actually attracting. At Affinio our mission is to help marketers and strategists understand who their content is attracting ensuring they are effectively targeting the right audience. Here's an example of what an irrelevant (yet award winning) social audience looks like. A few months ago we shared our product with a group who had recently won an award for selling an adult targeted over the counter medical product. Typically products like this are not the easiest thing to sell on social media - but this group had pushed hard and grown an impressively large audience considering the product type. As a result they were rewarded with an award for their efforts reinforcing the types of content they were creating. Unfortunately most of the audience they attracted were actually using their product to make a popular recreational drug called purple drank (also known as lean). Note: We've anonymized the account data to protect the brand and agency. Tips for brands: Our reports cost $500 each a small price to pay to ensure the agency you hired is actually doing their job and attracting right audience (rather than a totally irrelevant and sometimes irresponsible one). Tips for agencies: We suggest that you run at least one report on every brand you represent to ensure you are attracting the right audience with your content.

According to BIA Kelsey forecasts U.S. social display ad revenues will grow to $5.6 billion by 2018. Coupled with the fact that people are leading lives that often merge seamlessly between on and offline worlds the RFP and pitch cycle is becoming a battleground in which traditional PR boutique and digital shops vie in many cases for the same new business opportunities. In this progressively competitive arena the sharpest new business professionals are finding massive advantages in driving deep audience insights from social graph data. Social graph data provides an opportunity to dig deeper than surface level mention insights. When leveraged correctly this data provides pitches with unique insights into the culture of the moment a more complete understanding of a brand's customers a true picture of the competitive landscape fresh business opportunities and data supported visions that truly impress and win. Traditional listening tools are an excellent place to start when gathering insights for pitches. However since these tools are built entirely off of what people say they can be cumbersome and inaccurate when your goal is to truly understand everyone—not just the small percentage of a social audience that actively posts and engages. By looking at the social graph new business teams can capture complete insights about every individual in their target audiences even if these people rarely tweet or post. This approach helps new business teams understand the affinities of the unique communities within their target audience and maps all of the relevant content articles YouTube videos hashtags mentions Vines Instagram images tweet keywords and domains that activate specific communities within a target audience. Here are several ways we have seen some of our amazing customers use social graph insights to win new business. Save time Affinio reports take less than 50 minutes to run allowing you understand the culture of an entire audience in under an hour. Not only is this incredibly fast but these reports also encompass all of the affinity data points in the audience. Consider this: if each person in an audience of 1.5 million people has an average of a 1000 relationships with friends family co-workers brands and news sources the dataset you’re working with is likely 1500000000 edges. Now add in every piece of content these people have shared in the last 30 days and imagine what that would look like in Excel! How long would this take you to compile manually? Accurate data-driven personas Oftentimes there is a misalignment between who a brand thinks is in its social audience and who is actually there. When you just listen to audiences you can always find someone somewhere who has said whatever it is that supports what you want to find. By looking at the follower graph you remove confirmation biases since like-minded people connect together through shared interests that they both have with each other. These relationships best reflect who a person is since most people don’t tweet in a way that lets you accurately understand what their passions and affinities actually are. On a macro level connected communities within your audience are the best indication of the personas of people that are actually within it. Know the voice of your customer The ability to understand with supporting data the types of messaging and assets active within a target audience is make-it-or-break-it in new business pitches. It’s not enough to list vanity metrics like generic clicks or likes; brands want to know that the right message engages the right people. With Affinio you’re able to know that a piece of content that has been previously shared in your target audience activated specific tribes in your audience. Insights like this when used to support your vision help prove that your pitch idea will in fact be memorable and engage the intended and right people.

They are easily identified by their high interests to brands and ONLY brands. With back to school around the corner we wanted to further explore this niche audience. While there are a lot of 'Coupon Moms' out there not all are created equal. There are a number of subtleties that can further differentiate these audience members. Using Affinio we learned more about these subtle differences and the different types of 'Coupon Moms' out there by looking at how these users self-describe other accounts they are interested in and the content they shared. To start we needed to find a community of 'Couponers'. We decided to start in an obvious place we ran an analysis on the followers of some of the most popular Walmart Moms and Mommy Bloggers. We used the following handles: @dealseekingmom @consumerqueen @eringifford @kingdomfirstmom @savingeveryday @wholesomemommy @thrifychicmom @danamarieadams. We then limited the analysis to followers located in the US only. The size of this audience is about twenty-two thousand. Here are the tribes that the audience broke out into: Of course the tribe that we were most interested in was the 'Coupon Moms.' Here's how the members of this tribe self-describe: Top used hashtags: Considering the total size of the audience was ~22k and the 'Coupon Moms' tribe only makes up 9% of that audience we wanted to find more coupon moms like those found in this tribe. Using Affinio we ran an extension of this tribe by looking at everyone across Twitter who had a similar 'interest profile' and the audience size that came back was ~82k. Running this audience through Affinio left us with six niche tribes. While all of these tribes are interesting in their own right we will look at the 'Couponers' and 'Giveaways' tribes. These two tribes have some serious similarities but there are small differences that make them cluster into two separate groups. Let's take a look. Here's how the 'Couponers' self-describe: Contrarily here's how the 'Giveaways' tribe self-describe: The top 100 most relevant accounts to the 'Couponers' tribe: The top 100 most relevant accounts to the 'Giveaways' tribe: The top used hashtags by members of the 'Couponers' tribe: The top used hashtags by members of the 'Giveaways' tribe: As you can see there are a number of similarities in the top used bio-keywords and top hashtags used however looking at the top 100 most relevant accounts shows that these two tribes are interested in very different things. Many of the top relevant accounts to the 'Couponers' tribe are bigger corporations that issue coupons for various products. Whereas the top relevant accounts to the 'Giveaways' tribe represent a number of mommy bloggers and more often than not on lifestyle blogs you'll see that bloggers have a number of contests for giveaway prizes. These insights are important for marketers to understand the realm of 'Coupon Moms' out there and how to effectively target each subgroup.

,193,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,193,http://www.affinio.com/blog/from-fin-to-fan-shark-attack-boosts-followers-for-pro-surfer,From Fin to Fan: Shark Attack boosts followers for Pro Surfer,Image Source: Surfline Pop culture has an obsession with sharks. From the news to Shark Week to Jaws and even Sharknado we are collectively curious entertained and scared of these silver-skinned sharp-toothed beasts. In spite of the attention shark attacks are relatively rare. However when they do happen they make headlines and fill our social streams. While most people know sharks most intimately through the movies CNN FOX and The Discovery Channel surfers have a more visceral relationship with sharks. To a surfer the thought of a shark interrupting the fun is real but something that most try not to think too much about. That is until a shark tries to bite a competitor during the finals of J-Bay Open the sixth stop on the WSL Samsung Galaxy Championship Tour in South Africa. Mick Fanning the near-victim and three time tour champion is widely known in the surfing world. Despite his accomplishments and talent he doesn’t have the mainstream clout that traditional athletes or even action sports stars have. That is until now—the eyes of the surfing world and the mainstream media are all on Mick and on Red Bull Rip Curl Audi and Samsung—companies that endorse him and the tour. As they say “If it bleeds it leads.” Luckily Mick is okay and not bleeding but he and his sponsors will certainly be leading headlines. We monitored the audience of Mick Fanning on Twitter to understand more about who his new followers are and what else they care about. Hours after the attack we ran our first report on Mick Fanning’s social audience at 9:12 PM EST on Sunday. Figure 1: Audience Segments At this time the largest segments of his audience were surfers. These people had high affinities for surfing brands athletes publications and often explicitly described themselves as a “surfer” in their twitter bio. ‘Surfer’ Segment Bio Keywords Smaller segments of Mick Fanning’s audience included more pop culture centric tribes like Australian Pop Culture College Dude Humor & Entertainment Pop Music & Movie Fans and UK Sports Fans. Figure 2: Audience Composition We monitored Mick Fanning’s audience two times post shark attack. Once at 8:13 AM EDT the day after to capture the Australian growth and later that day at 1:10 PM EDT to capture the post morning news reaction on the East Coast of the USA and Europe. Figure 3: Follow Growth After the first update Mick had gained 2980 new followers overall with non-surfer tribes like Australian Pop Culture College Dude Humor & Entertainment UK Sports and Pop Music & Movies gaining at the greatest velocities. These tribes increased at rates of 4.34% 4.01% 3.57% and 3.17% respectively which was well above the audience average of 1.82%. At the second update the same tribes continued to grow at consistent velocities. With Australian Pop Culture College Dude Humor & Entertainment UK Sports and Pop Music & Movies gaining at rates of 5.08% 5.75% 4.99% and 4.02% respectively. Figure 4: Percentage Change We also compared tracked hashtags to see if certain terms resonated more with non surfer audiences compared with surfer audiences. Figure 5: Terms that Over Index by Tribe What we found was that in the light green tribe which represents Australian Pop Culture members tended to talk on average more about #shark and #sharkattack more than any other tribes.

As a born and raised in Atlanta Killer Mike has advocated at every level for the rights and best interests of Americans regardless of their race religion or class. His community engagement combined with the fact that he’s a Grammy award-winning rapper has put him in a position of influence across America. Bernie needed this boost of support from Killer Mike as Clinton has been crushing him in the poles within African American communities. We used Affinio to review the 170285 people on Twitter following Killer Mike. Affinio's powerful algorithm is able to analyze the network connections of people within an audience and score how relevant other Twitter accounts to them. Using this approach Affinio found that Bernie Sanders' accounts are the 329th and 345th most relevant accounts to the people following Killer Mike compared to 756th and 914th for Clinton and Trump. Reviewing the conversations held by Killer Mike's followers between Oct 28th - Nov 27th further shows the impact of his endorsement. Top mentioned accounts by followers of Killer Mike: Top used hashtags by followers of Killer Mike: Top domains followers of Killer Mike shared content from: Top 5 favorite tweets by followers of Killer Mike: Brought this guy to Busy Bee on MLK in ATL. pic.twitter.com/K93EUniUZE — Killer Mike (@KillerMike) November 23 2015 Bernie Sanders and rapper Killer Mike at Busy Bee in Atlanta. pic.twitter.com/jqOiLlMgrQ — John Wagner (@WPJohnWagner) November 23 2015 Taking Bernie Sanders To A Soul Food Spot On MLK — Killer Mike (@KillerMike) November 23 2015 If I'm "finished" I don't know what it says about Trump's situation when I'm 9pts ahead of him in the new NBC poll. https://t.co/V3aGX9KQW9 — Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) November 3 2015 3400: Americans who died by Terrorism since 2001 3400: Americans who died by household Firearms since five weeks ago. — Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) November 9 2015 The data shows that Killer Mike's endorsement of Bernie Sanders resonated loud and clear with his followers. Bernie Sanders was mentioned in the top hashtags mentions tweets and domains something neither Hillary nor Trump could match. Using Affinio Bernie Sanders would be able to understand the personas he’s attracting the accounts that matter most to each persona and even the content and topics that matter most. He could also run competitive reports to understand how other candidates measure up and identify key segments he could conquest against. Once Bernie and his team picked key segments to target Affinio provides a list of all the key influencers to that segment making it easy for Bernie to pick who should introduce and endorse him next. Killer Mike's powerful speech highlighted how important it is to be endorsed by an influential leader of a community - something Bernie needs to continue to receive if he's to win in 2016.

Over the years its evolved and expanded into the worlds of art music design lifestyle fashion and more. To many Hypebeast is the leader in everything that is current and cool - so much so that even Kanye West browses the site and name drops it in interviews to let the world know that he's on top of culture. Hypebeast covers a wide variety of products and topics which attracts a diverse audience. When you visit the HYPEBEAST home page you'll notice tabs across the top of the page directing you to subpages for Fashion Footwear Arts Design Music Entertainment TV and more. To better understand the different personas within this audience I used Affinio to analyze the interests and affinities of the 245K followers of @HYPEBEAST on Twitter. Persona’s found within the audience of HYPEBEAST: The above graphic shows the groups (we call them tribes) of like minded people that Affinio's algorithm found within the audience. The tribes we found map nicely to the primary sections on the HYPEBEAST home page. Each colour represents a tribe and the density of the tribes shows how interconnected and strong their relationships are. The segmentation is based on the interests and affinities of audience members resulting in tribes of people who all share the same psychographic profile. Tribe Sizes: To better understand the differences between tribes I drilled down into the Designer/artist tribe as well as the Streetwear fans tribe to highlight how different the culture of two tribes can be.

,196,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,196,http://www.affinio.com/blog/goodbye-demographics-why-age-agnostic-marketing-is-the-future,Goodbye Demographics! Why Age-agnostic Marketing is the Future,The days of one-size-fits-all-marketing to reach millennials is over. According to Hotwire PR's seventh annual 'Communications Trends Report' in 2016 marketing and communications professionals will stop targeting millennials as one demographic and focus on reaching the younger consumers based on their passions and interests - or - psychographics. In other words in order to better connect with an audience marketers will need to implement age-agnostic strategies. But why? Using the words of Seth Godin marketers need to understand that everyone is not your audience. The millennial cohort or those born in the early 1980s to 2000s is incredibly diverse and comprised of individuals with varying interests passions and lifestyles. Gone are the days of mass-marketing strategies. Consumers today are much more diverse and fragmented. Speaking from experience as a twenty-three year old female falling smack in the middle of the millennial cohort what would appeal to me may not appeal to my cohort peers who are in the their teenage years or early thirties. By relying solely on demographics to reach millennials marketers are essentially throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. What I mean to say is demographics are limiting. To demonstrate the limitations of demographic targeting we will perform a high-level analysis of the brand Lululemon Athletica which is popular with the millennial cohort using the Affinio platform. Using the Affinio platform we analyzed Lululemon’s Twitter following (@Lululemon) and segmented the audience into eight segments or tribes. After a quick analysis of the tribes we chose two tribes that fit reasonably within our sample demographic profile: Sample Demographic Profile Age: 23-34 Sex: Female Race/Ethnicity: Caucasian Location: New York Language: English The tribe members were predominantly female likely fell into the 18-32 age bracket based on their content interests and influencers are located in New York and other large cities and speak English. However without understanding the interests and passions of these audiences we are missing key cultural insights and consumer values. To demonstrate let’s take a look at the keywords both tribes use to self describe their top social conversation topics and the domains in which they consume content from - all pulled from the Affinio platform. Tribe #1 Terms tribe #1 members use to describe themselves: Top used hashtags by tribe #1 members: Top domains of tribe #1 members: Tribe #2 Terms tribe #2 members use to describe themselves: Top used hashtags by tribe #2 members: Top domains of tribe #2 members: As we can see psychographics provide much more useful information about users than demographics. Based on our sample demographic profile both of our psychographic profiles above would have been considered identical and targeted the same way. However the two tribes based on how they self-describe their social conversation topics and preferred domains are not clearly not identical. To break this down further we can infer that the brand appeals to our first tribe primarily because of its functionality and fit with their yoga-centred lifestyle. Our second tribe uses Lululemon gear primarily because of its fashion and trendiness. The use case for these two tribes is completely different so why market to these groups in the same way? Using psychographics to guide your strategy is critical for connecting to consumers on an emotional level. Consumers expect more from brands today and they want to see content that is relevant to them. There is nothing worse than being served ads with no relevance (am I right?!). You wouldn’t serve high-fashion content to a yoga instructor looking for functional active wear. By having a deep understanding of your audience marketers can create meaningful content that consumers will actually want to welcome and not refute. How do I find my audience interests? With technologies like Affinio it is now possible to identify psychographic information that before was not easily acquired. We leverage the social graph to understand not only the demographics of an audience but more importantly their interests and passions how and where they consume content and what content resonates with them. Our job is to redefine the way you research plan and execute marketing strategies. As consumers continue to diversify brands will need to better understand their audiences’ and build content and strategies that relate to them or risk losing their loyalty in 2016. Remember the best marketing doesn't feel like marketing.

,197,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,197,http://www.affinio.com/blog/who-listens-to-serial-using-social-data-to-understand-podcast-audiences,Who Listens to Serial? Using Social Data to Understand Podcast Audiences,Podcasts have been the chosen medium of audio consumption for a small but loyal audience for almost a decade. But over the past couple of years they’ve come into their own with listenership rapidly increasing. A recent study revealed that the number of Americans aged 12+ who’ve listened to a podcast in the past month is up 42% from 2013 and it seems as though that figure will only rise. This popularity has not only helped the launch of new shows but has also opened a new field for advertisers. Marketing departments have to be strategic choosing to advertise across multiple shows (looking at you MailChimp … or should we say Mail Kimp?) or even by launching their own podcasts to engage their fan-base with shows like Slack’s “Slack Variety Pack”. Many credit the resurgence of podcasts to the award-winning show Serial. Launched in the fall of 2014 it focused on the murder of a high school student in Baltimore. The story swept the nation by storm with everyone forming their own opinions as to the guilt or innocence of Adnan Masud Syed the accused murderer. Many entertainment companies (including those based in both the television and music industries) leverage Affinio data to identify which groups of people they are connecting with most effectively. They can then use this intel on audience interests to help dictate decisions like potential advertisers and future storylines. So with season 2 of Serial kicking off last week we decided to analyze their audience and see who Serial really was resonating with. By simply analyzing @Serial at a high-level you can see that the show’s impact was felt beyond the scope of podcast fans. Strong support for Serial also resonated in interest groups such as: Sports Fans the Silicon Valley tech scene News Junkies and a group that is obsessed with everything Hollywood related. Analyzing the Top Interests of all the followers of @Serial also helps support the diversity of the audience that was reached. Beyond the top ranked accounts of Serial This American Life and This American Life’s host Ira Glass a wide variety of interests are clearly visible including The Onion Amy Schumer Nate Silver the Dalai Lama and NASA. Looking at the geographic breakdown of followers also shows the global reach of @Serial. Beyond the Eastern seaboard of the United States and Southern Ontario in Canada which makes sense due to the crime taking place in Baltimore the reach of Serial also stretched across the Atlantic Ocean with a strong following in the UK a decent following in southern Australia and a very niche followership in Brazil where Serial was extremely popular with teenage females. With this expanded reach more and more advertisers are recognizing the niche audiences that tune into podcasts and are becoming interested in promoting their companies and brands in the space. Analyzing the Brands section of the Interest tab within Affinio we can see that some brands who resonate highly with Serial include Dropbox Whole Foods and Target. For this reason they might want to consider advertising in season 2 as the podcast has delivered a captive audience. Or more specifically if you are looking to capitalize on the popularity of Serial in the UK brands who might consider the podcast as a strong advertising opportunity include Netflix UK ASOS Waterstones and Topshop. All in all the Serial podcast wasn’t simply a major success for just co-creators Sarah Koenig and Julie Synder but for the entire podcast scene.

It refers to the infinite audiences possible online as opposed to the limited groups a person can normally interact with in F2F circumstances. In bounded interactions people adjust their tone and presentation to fit the social context. In a situation of context collapse this becomes impossible. - HLWIKI Every digital marketer has struggled with the effects of "context collapse". At any moment millions of conversations and pieces of content are being presented into a billion unique feeds. As a marketer how do you know what content matters to your ideal audience? Which feeds do you want your content be shown in? What other content is contextually relevant to your ideal audience? To help marketers answer these questions and sift through all the noise on social media Affinio has developed the ability to segment any social audience into niche communities based on interests and affinity (also known as tribes). To do this we use award winning technology to mine the social and interests graphs breaking a large group of people into many small highly focused groups based on affinity. We present these tribes along with psychographic data for each in a highly visual dashboard - providing marketers and strategists with the insights they need to create content that will truly resonate. With Affinio’s insights marketers can once again focus their tone and presentation to fit their ideal audience and context. Example: We segmented the audience of @nikerunning and found 14 distinct tribes within their follower base. To give you an idea of the diversity of their interests we generated sample Twitter streams for both the Teen girl and Sneakerhead tribes: Every brand needs to identify and understand the different tribes within their social audience to ensure the content they create fits the context it will be viewed in.

,202,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,202,http://www.affinio.com/blog/understand-social-audience-cision-acquisition,What new audience did Cision acquire through Viralheat?,If you’ve been following any tech news or social media this week then it’s not new to you that Cision a Chicago PR tech firm acquired Viralheat a social media marketing platform. Adweek released a PR Newser on the acquisition and author Shawn Paul Wood highlighted the solidified presence in the industry that Cision already had pre-acquisition. What I thought was most thought-provoking and relevant to the purpose of this post is that Wood hypothesized Cision is trying to be the only "game" in the market but questioned how adding Viralheat will change their service. Well not only is Cision acquiring another company to add to their purchase list a new batch of employees and new technology but Cision is acquiring an entirely new social audience. I used the Affinio platform to analyze the Twitter audiences of both Cision and Viralheat. The audience of these two accounts combined is approximately 75000 and the split between who follows Cision vs. Viralheat is nearly equal. Of the approximate 75000 followers of Cision and Viralheat 51.2% are followers of Cision whereas 48.8% are followers of Viralheat. Here's an overview of what that combined audience looks like: By analyzing these handles together I'm able to see the share of audience within each tribe (or segmentations within an audience). Essentially what this means is that of everyone in a particular tribe which handle's audience do they belong to? As you can see below 4469 members of the 'Public Relations' tribe belong to the audience of Cision: I wanted to see if there was a niche tribe that Cision was acquiring that was unique to Viralheat. The 'Writers and Bloggers' tribe which consists of 6960 followers is owned by Viralheat Not only is that a huge number of followers that Cision did not already have but it's also a huge number in relation to Cision's current followers of 'Writers and Bloggers' which amounts to 264 members. This is what the members of the 'Writers and Bloggers' tribe look like: How they self-describe: Their top 10 Affinities: Ian Author Promotion iAuthor Tom Hobbs Judy Feldhausen Joanne Wadsworth Philip Arnold Rashad Pharaon Les Floyd Natural Health Care Jake Needham Lori McNee The top 10 most shared visual media: The 5 Beginner Mistakes most Youtubers Make & How to Stop Sucking on Camera How to Deal with Self-Doubt My Simple Trick to Staying Motivated 10 Legendary Rules from Legendary Entrepreneurs Neil deGrasse Tyson: The Most Astounding Fact Talking Creating Amazing Customer Experiences with Ricardo Saltz Gulko The 3 Most Important Things Investors Look for in a Winning Business Plan Your 5-step Plan into Getting International Distributors The One Mindset Shift that Creates Success - Howard Schultz Motivation If Everyone Care - Nickelback Cision’s CEO Peter Granat released a statement that is flooding nearly every news article related to this deal stating that: “This acquisition of Viralheat is a prime example of our commitment to expanding our social offering and providing innovative products and services to PR communication social and content marketing professionals." Well considering they're acquiring a unique tribe of 'Writers and Bloggers' from Viralheat's Twitter audience (and this isn't the only niche tribe they're acquring) I would suspect that this is one of many ways that Cision's audience is growing in the way that they anticipated.

Despite the fact that we use Hubspot we have love for all 3 platforms and are always reviewing the best solutions out there for our needs. To better understand the followers (and potential customers) of each of these platforms I used Affinio to segment and analyze the combined audiences of all three. The goal of this was to get a better idea of the various persona's each platform attracts and caters to. Report Details Hubspot: 486K followers Marketo: 104K followers Pardot: 58.5K followers We started by segmenting their followers into tribes of like-minded people. Here are the tribes found: Once segmented we looked at the share of voice each account had within a tribe. The following pie charts are normalized to account for the difference in account sizes. Based on these insights it's clear that Hubspot is dominating the small business and SEO crowds. Pardot is doing really well in the Spanish speaking/Latin American markets while Marketo holds a firm grip on the content marketing crowd.

With a combined Instagram audience of over 13 Million followers they are leaders in contemporary entertainment and culture. They have collaborated on tracks in the past but that all changed Tuesday when Meek Mill took to Twitter posting a series of anti-Drake tweets including: Stop comparing drake to me too.... He don't write his own raps! That's why he ain't tweet my album because we found out! 😁 — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) July 22 2015 He ain't even write that verse on my album and if I woulda knew I woulda took it off my album..... I don't trick my fans! Lol — Meek Mill (@MeekMill) July 22 2015 Drake stayed quiet about the comments until he shot back at Meek Mill Saturday dropping this 'Charged Up' track: This beef is just getting warmed up yet it's already one of the hottest entertainment stories of the summer. All of the drama had us wondering who's in Drake's corner and who's in Meek Mill's? To better understand the fans of both rap superstars we took to Instagram and analyzed the over 13 Million people who follow Drake Meek Mill or both. (Click/Tap on the picture below to open the full sized infographic) These personas allow us to look at the sub-cultures within this large audience to determine which rapper has influence over any given niche. After reviewing the Instagram data it’s clear that Drake is much more popular in the pop culture and fashion oriented groups while Meek Mill is the go-to choice for die hard rap fans (and their moms!).

,206,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,206,http://www.affinio.com/blog/back-to-basics-hot-to-relate-to-your-customer-in-todays-world,Back to Basics: How to relate to your customer in today's world,Do you know if your content is resonating with your audience? Do you know who exists in your audience? Do you use Buyer Personas to build targeted content? If so how do you build those personas?Personalized data-driven marketing will become increasingly important moving into 2016 and beyond. Building strong relationships with your customers will become more important in this ever diversified digital world. This is not new it's just something we haven't been doing a great job at. Getting back to basics The Furrow is a magazine about agriculture farming and any other topic that is relevant and interesting to the average farmer. John Deere first produced this content in 1895. You could say that this is this first piece of content marketing (that we can reference anyway) and still exists today. John Deere started his company by listening and understanding his customers. John was able to talk to his customers face-to-face to hear their struggles and build products that suited their needs. John passed away before The Furrow was first published but it is based on his legacy of understanding your customers and providing them with information suited to their interests and needs. In today's world we don't have the opportunity to interact with each of our customers face-to-face. Our customers are more diverse and unique than ever before they are not located down the road from you they are spread out all over the country or world. So how do we create a customer experience that is unique and personalized? Buyer Personas are not a new concept but how we build them is. You likely use personas to create your Marketing strategies and plan your content. But how are you defining these target segments? Let's talk about demographic targeting Who is your target market? Way back you may have defined it as "Females aged 18-49". In the 80's Marketers realized this wasn't enough and introduced 'Generational Targeting' defining consumers not just by age but also by social economic demographic and psychographic factors. Then 'Cohort targeting' which was centered around the life path of a target segment. We seemed to have stopped the evolution of targeting there for the most part. With all of the complex data and information about consumers that we have today why are we still basing targeting around simple demographics like age location gender income? It's so common to hear a market defined as "Females aged 18-24 who attend College and love beauty products". Ok so that's more complex than just demo's but one girl attending college aged 23 who wears makeup may be the MVP of the Basketball team and really into EDM and the bar scene. While another 23-year-old girl attending the same college who wears makeup is First Chair Cellist in the school orchestra and is interested in Yo-yo's (my kinda girl). I'm sure you are getting my drift here. It is a Buyer's market. Today's consumers are more informed than ever before. They could know more about your company and product than your frontline sales people do. They are sophisticated and demanding (rightfully so). Today's buyers (not just limited to Millenials) don't want to be lumped into a category that a Marketing team came up with based on past customer data and opinions. They want to feel understood they want to be delighted they want to trust you. Today's consumers are not demographics they are people. They are individuals with diverse interests and they demand more from you. Defining target market by interest profiles It is not realistic to think that a company today can market face-to-face or even one-to-one to ALL of their customers. The availability of complex data and information however gets us closer to offering a 'one-on-one' experience. At Affinio we believe that target markets can't be limited by a stagnant description of an audience based on demographics. We believe in understanding your customer through what they are interested in no matter their age allowing you to understand the diverse Buyer Personas that exist within your audience and understanding them through what they are interested in and care about most. Winter is coming (ughh) and that means technical apparel to keep you warm - at least it does here in Canada. We're big fans of Patagonia here at Affinio so we wanted to take a peek at who the other Patagonia fans are. For this we used the Affinio Platform to analyze the social connections that exist within Patagonia's twitter audience segmented the members into Tribes of people with similar interests then were able to understand Patagonia's fans on a more personal level. Visualization of Patagonia's audience Not surprisingly a lot of these communities are centered around sports and adventure. Notice however that people that may have been traditionally grouped together in a "US Male adventurists aged 30-45" are broken out into many tribes. These are not pre-defined interest categories. They are unsupervised naturally formed clusters based on what else and who else Patagonia's followers follow. Let's look at a few examples of these tribes. After reviewing these examples of interest-based tribe summaries would you market to these people in the same way? Do you think that the 'Runners' use Patagonia gear in the same way that the 'Fishers' do? Do you think that all people that exist within the 'Runner' tribe are a similar age or gender? Maybe but why would we limit ourselves to that when we can relate to these people based on their interests and what they care about most. Demographics are not People. Interests are a better way to understand who your individual customers are and what they care about most. Once you understand this you are better able to connect with your customer segments through personalization leading to your customers feeling better understood and resulting in a trusting relationship.

How This Partnership Came to Be Over the summer we produced numerous sports-related blog posts about identifying sponsorship opportunities that resonate with sports team's and player's audiences by leveraging the social graph. These posts caught a lot of attention. We started to notice people sharing them with the hashtags #SMSports and #SportsBiz. To understand who these people were we analyzed anyone who had used those hashtags over the last 30 days using the Affinio platform. We identified that there was a community of 'Sports Business + Sponsorship' professionals using these hashtags regularly and would be the tribe most interested in our posts so we decided to write a summary post on this unique tribe. Professor Darin White founder and coordinator of the sports marketing program at Samford is in the Top 200 most influential accounts for this community. We caught his attention with this post. Darin thought that incorporating Affinio's analysis into the classroom would be a great learning opportunity for his students. Read more about our relationship and how the students will use Affinio in the press release below. Press Release SAMFORD'S SPORTS MARKETING PROGRAM TEAMS WITH AFFINIO TO TRAIN STUDENTS Samford University’s Brock School of Business sports marketing program has entered into an alliance with Affinio a leading audience insights company based in Canada.

PICTURES Mad Max: Fury Road is now in theatres and so far the world has loved it earning the film an intial rating of 99% Fresh on Rotton Tomatoes. To better understand who's talking and potentially seeing the film I used Affinio's partnership with GNIP to analyze everyone who was talking about the film in the past 30 days. I was able to find 52785 accounts discussing the movie and used Affinio to segmented them into tribes based on their interests and affinities. This segmentation uncovered a broad international audience as well as some interesting insights on the types of Mad Max related content they were discussing and sharing most. Tribes found mentioning Mad Max: While reviewing the various tribes I noticed a common theme emerging accross almost all of them that centered around Charlize Theron's character Imperator Furiosa. A story on a group of Men's Rights Activists and their frustration about the character has overshadowed all other Mad Max related content. Top 5 Mad Max related links being shared by movie mentioners: Incredibly Peeved Men's Rights Activists Call for Boycott of Mad Max Are Unintentionally Hilarious Furious about Furiosa: Misogynists are losing it over Charlize Theron's starring role in Mad Max: Fury Road Mad Max: Fury Road Times - Movie Tickets | Fandango 'Mad Max: Fury Road' draws the ire of men's rights activists Every Killer Car in Mad Max: Fury Road Explained After reviewing 3 of the top 5 movie related links were related to a group of men's rights activits being unhappy by how badass Imperator Furiosa is. Furiosa: JASIN BOLAND/WARNER BROS. PICTURES It's clear that the fans of Mad Max are siding with Furiosa and are doing a great job of making the men's right group look like a bunch of ignorant immature children. In addition to reviewing the content that mattered most to these fans Affinio was able to map the highest affinity accounts on Twitter to them. High Affinity Accounts: The top accounts are mostly related to gaming and sci fi which indicates an audience filled with gamers. Given recent events such as Gamergate and other sexists issues facing gaming it's encouraging to see so many gamers taking a pro feminist stance.,Brian,May 15 2015

We met some major milestones including receiving $4 million in Series A funding partnering with some amazing brands such as BBC Worldwide launching our Discovery by Affinio app and growing our awesome team! Hey we’re proud of what we’ve accomplished this year! Learn more about our milestones in our post “Affinio’s Best of 2015 - Our Year In Review.” While we’ve been busy we’ve also been able to grow our digital blog. From weekly digital strategy posts to predicting the Super Bowl 50 halftime show our blog has covered a lot of ground. To wrap up 2015 we’ve compiled a list of our top 10 blog posts according to you our readers and our Affinio team and why these posts matter. 1. The 300 Accounts Leading Digital Marketing in 2015 What better way to kick off our list than with another list? Seriously this blog post lists the top media outlets thought leaders and brands that matter most to digital marketers. Whether you’re new to the industry or a digital veteran these are the accounts you won’t want to miss. 2. Targeting Niche Audiences on Instagram In September 2015 Instagram announced in a blog post that large and small advertisers would now be able to run campaigns in 30 countries. For advertisers the importance of understanding your audience is critical when launching a campaign on any platform (especially one with +400 million users!) This blog post uncovers how to correctly select and serve the right content to the right people on Instagram using Affinio. 3. Deep Learning: Disrupting Social Marketing and Advertising Advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence are continuing to grow at an intense pace. Most recently “deep learning” has become the go-to technique for advanced machine learning but don’t let these tech terms scare you! This blog post outlines just how Affinio is leveraging the power of “deep learning” to help marketers and advertisers find the audiences they want and communicate with them using an authentic brand voice. 4. How to Rock Your Next Pitch with Data-Driven Personas 2015 was pitch season! Ad agencies battled it out this year as some of the world’s largest brands such as Coca-Cola went up for agency review. With pitch season in full-swing this post broke down the importance of understanding who you are marketing to by creating data-driven personas.

It's grown into a massive success with close to 50K Twitter followers and over 1.5M likes on Facebook. If you haven't heard of the show before here's a short clip: According to zap2it Street Outlaws earned a series high rating of 1.89 HH / 1.61 P25-54 / 2.35 M25-54 / 1.51 P18-49 / 2.09 M18-49 AA%. Among Men 25-54 it beat CBS’ Two and a Half Men 2 Broke Girls Under the Dome and Mike and Molly FOX’s Masterchef and Hotel Hell and ABC’s Bachelor in Paradise and Mistresses. Additionally Discovery Channel was the #1 non-sports cable network on Monday night in Men 25-54 and M18-49 even out-delivering CBS and ABC. It's clear that Street Outlaws has dominated the male 25-54 audience with its niche content but what else do the guys watching this show care about? Which brands should be advertising on this show? Which celebrities should do a guest appearance? To better understand who the audience of Street Outlaws is we turned to Affinio's ability to analyze the social graph to help us find the various personas within the audience and provide in-depth psychographic insights on each. Tribes found within the audience of Street Outlaws: After reviewing the tribes the largest tribe was a group of drag racing fans who share similar interests outside of watching the show. Here's how members of the drag racing tribe self-describe: Here's where they live: Knowing how tribe members self-describe as well as where they live is a great start to building out a detailed persona of who these people are and the things they care about most. In addition to providing insights on the user's accounts Affinio also extracts the most relevant content to these tribe members.

The Affinio Relevance score measures the amount of influence a given account has over an audience. It is scored by looking at the affinity account size and number of people in an audience who already follow that account. Top Brands to Drag Racing Fans Top Celebrities to Drag Racing Fans Top Musicians to Drag Racing Fans Top Entertainment accounts to Drag Racing Fans Affinio's ability to map out the interests of the audience members allowed us to uncover that fans of this show are likely Chevrolet or Ford drivers who love Orange Country Choppers enjoy a Redbull or a Monster play Call of Duty or Grand Theft Auto and use K&N oil and air filters and Magnaflow exhaust systems on their cars. The data also shows that they shop at Cabela's Bass Pro Shops Footlocker or Academy eat Buffalo Wild Wings Taco Bell Burger King and like to drink Miller Lite. Members of the drag racing fans tribe have high affinity to automotive personalities such as Richar Ray Rawlings Chip Foose Dale Earnhardt Jr. Clay Millican and also have high affinity to varoius members of the Duck Dynasty show. They also listen to Blake Shelton Luke Bryan Eminem Metallica Slipknot and enjoy Larry The Cable Guy Jeff Dunham Joe Rogan and Adam Savage. Other TV shows they are likely to watch include Gas Monkey Garage Deadliest Catch Swamp People American Pickers Pawn Stars Ridiculousness Sons of Anarchy and UFC. They also turn to KOCO-5 Oklahoma City DiscoverComm Motor Trend HOT ROD Magazine Velocity News 9 Racer X SPEED Car and Driver and the NFL Network for entertainment and news. By segmenting and analyzing the entire social audience both brands and TV producers are able to understand who each tribe is and the things they care about most. These insights offer a holistic data-driven view of any audience in real time providing an unprecedented level of insight into any shows audience.

Every fall roughly 50 million students return to public elementary and secondary schools and they'll all need supplies to help them start the year off right. This means millions of pencils binders markers and more will be purchased making the back to school rush one of the busiest shopping times of the year. It also means that millions of teachers are also heading back into the classroom to start another year with a new class. After using Affinio's partnership with GNIP to analyze everyone on Twitter who used the hashtag #backtoschool in the past 30 days we found a tribe of Teachers Schools and Educators that contained a wealth of knowledge about how teachers are preparing to go back to the classroom this year. Tribes found using #backtoschool: Here's how the users within the Teachers Schools and Educators tribe self-describe in their Twitter profiles: Locations of tribe members: Key accounts that are relevant to teachers schools and educators: Top brands relevant to teachers schools and educators: Top media relevant to teachers schools and educators: Links most shared by teachers schools and educators in the past 30 days: What I Wish I'd Known as a New Teacher Head back to school with new features in Google Classroom 5 Highly Effective Teaching Practices 53 Ways to Check for Understanding 3 Things Students Desire to Hear From Teachers Read Where You Are Teaching Empathy: Are We Teaching Content or Students?

These insights are great if you are a marketer looking to target teachers schools or anyone in education.

While there are so many amazing pieces of technology out there this one seems to have grabbed the world's attention for a lot of reasons including: It's a new Apple product (duh) Watches that you can communicate through (and have lots of awesome features) have been the symbol of the future for decades. #AppleWatch I'm a let you finish but Penny from Inspector Gadget had that tech since the 80s! pic.twitter.com/CFMRMXjJVm — Andre (BlackNerd) (@BlackNerd) March 9 2015 Of course we were all paying attention to the release yesterday. Within our office we had some different opinions of the release. From 'there's no way in hell I would ever buy that' in our design department to 'when can I get my hands on one?' in our marketing department (aka Brian Jeffcock and I). We collected mentions of #AppleWatch over the course of the few hours surrounding the launch (about 54k mentions from 29k unique tweeters). We then ran the people who mentioned #AppleWatch through the Affinio algorithm to find out more about them. Let's take a closer look at two of the communities reacting to the launch the 'Business/Marketing' tribe and the 'Designer/Developer' tribe - two target communities for the watch. For this analysis the 'Business' tribe will be represented in Blue and the 'Designers' in Green. What did these tribes have to say about the #AppleWatch? Here are some sample tweets from the Business tribe: Excited about the #applewatch? For us battery life is the big concern - especially if it's supposed to replace our wallet or keys. — Consumer Eyes (@ConsumerEyes) March 9 2015 #AppleWatch has got my my name on it... — Ken Okajima (@kenokajima) March 9 2015 Haven't worn a watch in ~5 years but wanting this #applewatch.

For so many reasons. #applewatch — katharina (@k____k____) March 9 2015 So did #Apple let #DrEvil price out the new #AppleWatch? pic.twitter.com/uV7DqViA6F — Jeff Ramos (@ohjefframos) March 9 2015 Unconvinced. #AppleWatch — Nathan Phelps (@nwp) March 9 2015 From these tweets it seems like our sample size at the Affinio office transcended to the tribes associated with Brian (Designer/Developer) and I (Business/Marketing). The Business tribe seems ready to buy and the Designers don't seem to be in a rush to purchase any time soon. What's behind these reactions to the #AppleWatch? Let's take a closer look at who these tribes are and what makes them tick. How the Business and Designers tribes self-describe Bio Keywords from 'Business' (left) and 'Designer' (right) tribes Here we can see that the 'Business' tribe is comprised of people who mainly self-describe as 'Business' 'Marketing' and 'Entrepreneur' where the 'Designers' tribe mainly self-describe as 'UX' 'Design' and 'Developer'. What have they been talking about recently? This analysis covers the past 30 days. Here are the top hashtags and mentions used by the tribes over the month leading up to the launch. The Business Tribe Top Hashtags (Left) and Mentions (Right) used by the Business tribe The Designers Tribe Top Hashtags (Left) and Mentions (Right) used by the Designers tribe The mentions and hashtags give you an idea of what these tribes normally find important you also see the excitement building around the #AppleWatch event with related hashtags being injected into the conversation and mentions of @Tim_Cook increasing. Who influences these tribes? The Business tribe's influencers: Influencers of the Business tribe (Click to download list) Unique influencers to this tribe: Venture Beat Harvard Business Review Business Insider Bloomberg Business Inc.

Perhaps it has to do with the fact that a watch is iconic and Designers respect this while Business people are looking for the next piece of tech to help them be more connected and efficient..... and it's an Apple product some of us just *have to have it. Would you fall in the Business or Designers tribe? Let me know what you think of the #AppleWatch in the comments below. Would you spring for the gold one??,India,March 10 2015

At the core of WOM marketing is influencer marketing - the act of finding and empowering people who have influence over potential customers to share your product with their audience. While strategies on how to best use these influencers vary depending on the channels audience and goal of the campaign one challenge remains constant: Who influences our potential customers the most and how do we find and quantify them?

,217,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,217,http://www.affinio.com/blog/how-to-identify-key-influencers-within-a-niche-tribes,How to Identify Key Influencers Within Niche Tribes,Traditional marketing has almost always involved the use of endorsers or influencers in order to strengthen the marketing mix. As we know the digital world has changed the landscape of marketing. Social media is a two-way communication channel between your brand and your consumers. Users of social media channels choose to connect with the brands they love and care most about. Because of this not only is it valuable to continue using influencers but also to understand important figureheads that mean something to your key consumer segments. We know that social data is huge and by using Affinio not only can you build data-driven buyer personas or conduct a competitive analysis but you can also make data-driven decisions on which influencers to partner with taking an audience-centric approach. 1) Run a report or select an existing report Using the Affinio platform I chose to analyse the ~883k followers of @KateSpadeNY on Twitter. 2) Select a niche tribe After you have named your report pick a tribe on the left hand side that you want to explore further. I chose the 'Designers' tribe. 'Designers' Once you have selected and clicked into a tribe click on the 'Interests' tab across the top. This shows you the top 1000 contextually relevant accounts to this tribe below are the top 200 high relevance accounts to this tribe. These accounts have influence over this particular tribe. At first glance you can see that there are a mix of high relevance accounts: other fashion brands magazine brands social media channels and also individuals. Looking further at some of the individuals here's what they look like: These accounts are a collective mix of bloggers and celebrity influencers and are only a small sample of the bloggers and celebrity influencers within the 1000 high relevance accounts to this designers tribe. Piecing it together Data shows that users in the 'Designers' tribe are influenced by these bloggers so it would be beneficial for Kate Spade to team up with these bloggers in order to reach more potential customers. It may also help with brand diversification. Personally when I think of Kate Spade I think of luxury handbags. A few of the key influencers in the 'Designers' tribe are wedding bloggers which I would not have expected revealing another avenue for influencer programs. This influencer data can also help you cross over to traditional marketing as well recognizing different celebrities that influence this tribe selects the celebrity endorsers data shows you should partner with. How can you apply insights from identifying 'Influencers'? You can use this data to: Identify the most relevant accounts to a particular tribe whether it's brands celebrities communities sports or all relevant accounts Understand what other accounts resonate with your key audience segment Discover complementary brands to form partnerships Want to get started on identifying your key influencers in a niche tribe?,Laura Park,December 10 2015

To understand who is talking about this historical moment and to understand the context in which they are discussing it we decided to run an analysis of #PlutoFlyBy using mention data through our partnership with Gnip. By pulling in all of the mentions of #PlutoFlyBy over the last 30days Affinio looks at all of the accounts as a whole and then segments them into communities of people with shared interests based on who they choose to follow. Here is the visualization of the audience analysis: This visualization gives a good overview of the types of people interested in this recent news. To understand how these people differ from NASA's regular audience we ran an analysis of the @NASA audience. Most notably in the comparison between these two is the strong presence of 'Tech News' and a specific 'Astrophysicist' tribe in the #PlutoFlyBy analysis compared to NASA's regular following. To understand these tribes and why they are interested in #plutoflyby let's put some context behind them by looking at what they are interested in how they self-describe and the content that is relevant to them.

,219,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,219,http://www.affinio.com/blog/exploring-culture-anti-vaccination-supporters-social-media,Exploring the culture of anti-vaccination supporters on social media,There has been a divided debate around the pros and cons of vaccinations. On one side there's the medical community and a large percentage of our population who have always accepted that the advice of doctors is accurate and safe. The World Health Organization estimates that vaccinations save between 2 and 3 million lives per year and takes the position that vaccinations have a medically positive impact on everyone from infants to seniors. The other side consisting of primarily politically conservative females with little to no professional medical training is pushing back on conventional thinking and scientific methods with the suggestion that vaccines are the root cause of illness autism and even death. In the interest of emotionally-decoupled impartiality and to help understand more about the kinds of people who are against vaccination I dove into the audiences of a few of the Twitter accounts of those leading the charge in this controversial new movement. Here’s what I found: I started with the followers of @vaccidemic @thinkingmomsrev and @drwakefield which came out to around 6000 people. I then used Affinio to segment the entire group into separate tribes of like-minded people. Affinio’s affinity engine creates these tribes by looking at the social DNA profile of everyone in the audience extracting their respective interests affinities and culture and then grouping them into separate tribes based on these attributes. Network graph visualizing the different types of people within the movement: This exercise ensured that I could isolate and examine only those people who are truly anti-vaccination as opposed to people who simply use the term or follow the group out of interest. Unlike keyword or mentions-based insights platforms Affinio was able to dig deeply into this audience to uncover people who are anti-vaccination even if they’ve never stated it on social media. Analyzing segmenting and isolating a tribe of anti-vaccination Twitter users allowed me to learn the following previously unrevealed information about the movement. After his recent rant and video that touches on the topic of vaccination Jimmy Kimmel has become the number one target of the anti-vaccination movement. His account was the 5th most mentioned by anti-vaccination supporters in the past 30 days. I was also able to identify the following accounts as key influencers in the movement: Andy Wakefield thinkingmoms Canary Party Age of Autism Vaccine Epidemic Ginger Taylor VaxTruth.org TannersDad Tim Marcella Piper-Terry Barb Loe NVIC Here are the top 100 influential accounts on people who don’t believe in vaccination: (click on image to download the top 100 as a .csv) Top used hashtags by people who don’t believe in vaccination: #cdcwhistleblower #vaccines #hearthiswell #autism #b1less #vaccine #measles #nomandates #healthfreedom #cdcfraud #health #vaccineinjury #blacklivesmatter #novaxmandates #mmr #autismhoops #breakabillion #bigpharma #sb277 #cdc Top mentioned accounts by people who don’t believe in vaccination: @vaccin8tionnews @tannersdad @mission2heal @ceestave @jimmykimmel @ageofautism @vaccinexchange @youtube @stutzy6 @aspiesmom @vaxcalc @forhealthchoice @marathonjonn @beckyct @rockefellafilly @lalaruefrench75 @luckykelsey @sharylattkisson @nvicloedown Top shared links by people who don’t believe in vaccination: Whitehouse Petition: Prohibit any laws mandating the force and requirement of vaccinations of any kind.

They are sharing their stories with the world and trying to do the research needed to prove the risks and damages caused by vaccination. What wasn't clear is the credible sources they are using to back up their claims. The vast majority of content being shared lacked a link to a credible medical reference raising doubts as to the validity of the information being spread by the movement. My advice to the anti-vaccination movement is to start building credible case studies that use science to prove the dangers. Once compiled release these scientific findings on all of the influential accounts included in this .csv as they are the relevant and connected accounts within the movement.

,220,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,220,http://www.affinio.com/blog/understanding-the-hacker-culture-that-inspired-mr.-robot,Understanding the hacker culture that inspired Mr. Robot,Mr. Robot has been one of this year's biggest TV hits. With a rating of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 9/10 ranking on IMDB it’s clearly struck a chord with the public. The show follows the life of a young computer programmer who uses his talents to hack everyone including his friends family enemies and the world's biggest corporations. To better understand the various personas watching the show we analyzed the 104883 people who follow @Mr. Robot on Twitter. To do this Affinio analyzed the relational connections of everyone in the audience and segmented them into tribes based on their interests and affinities. Tribes Found Within Audience Of Mr. Robot: After reviewing we found a tribe of security experts and hackers whose technical skills and interests align to the main character Elliot. The technical accuracy of the show has been lauded by the tech community so it's no surprise Affinio was able to find a niche audience of hackers lurker within Mr. Robot's audience. Once a tribe has been identified within the larger audience Affinio compiles detailed psychographic insights on who these tribe members are. To start we present the terms tribe members use to self-describe as well as where they are located in the world: We then analyze the interests and affinities of tribe members and use this graph connections to identify the accounts tribe members find most relevant: @AffinioInc123456 Affinio Follow Affinio also looked at every piece of text or content posted or favorited and uses this information to build a list of content most relevant to these tribe members.

,221,Affinio_blog_content,Affinio_blog_content,221,http://www.affinio.com/blog/data-vs-creativity-lessons-from-david-boyle-of-bbc-worldwide,Data vs Creativity: Lessons from David Boyle of BBC Worldwide,The Strata + Hadoop conference is wrapping up today in New York. If you haven't been following it there are some innovative ideas around big data coming from the experts in data science. Our good friend David Boyle EVP Insight at BBC Worldwide gave a keynote speech on lessons he has learned about the use of data science in creative strategy. As David said data is everywhere we are swimming in it but businesses still aren't using this data to make smart decisions. This doesn't have to be the case. Data science can be welcomed into decision-making and creative vision. In his experience here are the lessons he has learned when making creative decisions using data. Insights from data science need to be memorable and easy to understand In creative businesses decisions are sometimes made without a lot of planning. You need to be prepared with these insights ahead of time and they need to be easily understood so that you can draw on them at the moment that a decision needs to be made. This allows you to make better smarter decision on the fly. In the end it's people that make decisions not algorithms and data We can provide all of the data and insights you need but in the end it's the experts that make the decisions. Data Scientists are programmed to find the optimal solution and make a recommendation but in a creative environment that's not how it should work. You need to add skills judgement expertise and gut instinct alongside data to make the best decisions.

A buyer persona is a fictional character created to represent each of your customer segments. They provide insights on who your ideal customer is and provides a reference when creating content providing customer service building new product features and more. Traditionally companies built personas using demographic information and sales history. Now we can build more robust data-driven buyer personas by leveraging new data sources such as the social graph.,Brian,May 13 2015
