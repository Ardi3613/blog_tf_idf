http://tomtunguz.com/the-single-ideal-characteristic-of-your-startups-first-customer/,The one ideal characteristic of your startup’s first customers,The one ideal characteristic of your startup’s first customers Over lunch last week an good friend who is an entrepreneur and I were brainstorming about the features of his optimal initial target market. His product hasn’t yet launched so he still had some decisions to make about which users and use cases to target. We wondered if there were a rule of thumb about initial target customer segments. We took out a blank sheet of paper and came up with this: Ideal Customer = max (DAU / MAU) Rapid iteration from informed feedback The best first customers are the most active customers - the ones who will use your product on a daily basis - or as close to a daily basis as possible. Active customers provide three key pieces of feedback: First their activity rate proves the product solves their need. In other words these users validate product/market fit. Second these power users can readily articulate the product’s shortcomings and because they use the product on a daily basis this feedback is fast and frequent. This enables the product team to make small daily course changes to fine-tune the product and inform the longer term product roadmap. Third active users are the best to test pricing because they understand the value of the product since it solves their need. It’s simple for them to express their willingness to pay. The second most important characteristic Ideally this highly active user base also is part of a tightly knit community one in which word spreads quickly. Active users tend also to be the most vocal users and the biggest proponents of a product. I don’t always build product but when I do I pick my customer segments Fast feedback cycles are fundamental to great product development. The best users use the product with maximum frequency generate usage data for analysis and also provide product feedback to drive the product toward product market fit faster. When choosing your initial target customer segment focus on daily users. Published 2012-12-07,Published 2012-12-07
http://tomtunguz.com/optimal-compensation-customer-success/,The Optimal Compensation Plan for Customer Success Teams,The Optimal Compensation Plan for Customer Success Teams At the Gainsight Pulse conference yesterday I moderated a panel with Boaz Maor VP of customer success at Mashery and Mike McKee SVP of customer success and services at Rapid7. During the panel both men described their path to building substantial customer success organizations at their respective companies. Boaz’s team numbers 60 people and Mike’s exceeds 160. Year Adoption Retention Expansion 2014 20% 70% 10% 2015 35% 55% 10% Over the course of the panel we discussed the ways to recruit structure and manage vibrant customer success teams. In his presentation Mike made an important point. He presented the table above which shows the three main responsibilities of customer success team and his team’s time allocation evolving with the needs of the business. In 2014 his team spent 70% of their time on retention with the remaining 30% split between adoption and expansion. In 2015 the company prioritize on-boarding to mitigate short-term customer churn by investing more time at the beginning of a relationship. This shift in customer success team emphasis is analogous to the changes in sales team focus described by Mark Roberge in his book about Hubspot called The Sales Acceleration Formula. In the early years Hubspot prioritized growth and consequently compensated their sales teams exclusively on new bookings. But after observing some of the initial churn rates of particular customer segments the company re-emphasized the importance of closing the right customers and added a churn component to the compensation structure of the sales teams to ensure that the sales teams were pursuing the right kinds of customers. Over the next few years Hubspot continued to evolve their sales compensation plan to reflect the needs and the priorities of the business. Today it’s not uncommon to see customer success teams compensated with a 70 ⁄30 or 75 ⁄25 compensation structure split between salary and performance compensation. This performance compensation is directly tied to up-sells and retention and should be managed to reflect the priorities of the business. There is no optimum compensation structure for a CS team. Like Hubspot’s sales team customer success teams should align their goals with the overall goals of the business. As priorities for the business change so should the compensation structure of the customer success team. Published 2015-05-13,Published 2015-05-13
http://tomtunguz.com/churn-mitigation/,The Three Churn Mitigation Strategies of SaaS Startups,The Three Churn Mitigation Strategies of SaaS Startups Every SaaS business suffers from churn. If churn isn’t managed properly the lost revenue from churned customers offsets new revenue and the business flat-lines or suffers negative revenue growth. I’ve seen startups employ three patterns for offsetting churn: acquiring new customers faster upselling existing customers to buy more software or structuring pricing to grow with customers. Each strategy requires different levels of investment but achieves similar results. These strategies are often deployed in addition to a customer success team which require their own investment. Below I’ve modeled a hypothetical company which grows from 100 to 50000 customers. The business charges an average of $20k per year (ACV) and loses 20% of their revenue to churn annually net of customer success efforts. For each strategy I show the investment required to offset revenue churn. Customers 100 1000 10000 50000 ACV 20000 20000 20000 20000 Revenue in $M 2 20 200 1000 Revenue Churn as % 20% 20% 20% 20% Revenue Churn in $M 0 4 40 200 Strategy 1: New Customer Acquisition CAC 25000 25000 25000 25000 Customers Req’d to Offset Churn 20 200 2000 10000 Average Sales Velocity per Rep per Year 60 60 60 60 Sales Reps Req’d to Offset Churn 1 3 33 167 Investment Required in $M 1 5 50 250 Strategy 2: Account Growth Upsell Revenue to Offset Churn 0 4 40 200 Conversion Rate of Customers to Upsell 20% 20% 20% 20% Upsold Customers 20 200 2000 10000 Upsold Customers Avg ACV 40000 40000 40000 40000 Average Sales Velocity per Rep per Year 60 60 60 60 Sales Reps for Upsell 1 3 33 167 Investment Required in $M 0.2 0.5 5 25 Strategy 3: Organic Growth Annual Organic Growth to Offset Churn 0 4 40 200 Customer CAGR Needed 20% 20% 20% 20% Average Customer ACV at EOY 25000 25000 25000 25000 Investment Required in $M ? ? ? ? The New Customer Acquisition strategy means acquiring new customers to fill the void of churned customers. This is the most expensive strategy to mitigate churn because each new customer costs about 15 months’ worth of contract value to acquire. Plus the sales team must grow to field these customers. At 10000 customers or a $200M run rate the company must invest $50M in acquiring new customers just to sustain their revenues. If like most SaaS companies this one invests about 50% of revenue into sales and marketing they can generate a 40% total revenue increase half of which goes to filling the vaccuum left by churn. Then the company’s growth is capped at 20% annually. The Account Growth strategy requires account managers within the startup to sell more seats or units of the software to existing customers. By growing 20% accounts from $20k ACV to $25k in the first year account managers offset churn. Upselling existing customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new customers because a relationship exists already. This model assumes 20% conversion to upsell rate which implies the average contract value for upsold customers must double to $40k. This hypothetical strategy requires the same number of people and labor costs to achieve but it costs 1/10th the investment of the New Customer Acquisition Strategy because there is no additional CAC. The Organic Growth strategy is likely most efficient but necessitates tradeoffs. As customers’ needs grow so does pricing. In this example if all renewing customers’ revenues grow on average 20% in a year their growth offsets the churn. The costs of this approach are likely very much lower than the others because the cost of growth is borne by the customer. However this model only works for particular types of companies those with utility based pricing or products that enable self-service out grow of contract requirements. So it is hard to model generically. Also this model trades “frictionless” organic growth for the revenue predictability offered by contracts another tradeoff. These three churn mitigation strategies are rarely employed independently but are often combined. Only in the case of this hypothetical startup is the distinction between them stark and clean. Most startups blend new customer acquisition account growth and organic growth to nullify churn impact on revenue growth. But I think this framework models the efficiency of each tactic well enough to inform a strategic conversation about which channels are the best ones to keep the business growing.

http://tomtunguz.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-take-your-startup-public/,How Much Does It Cost to Take Your Startup Public?,How Much Does It Cost to Take Your Startup Public? Raising money for a startup is expensive. The typical legal fees for a Series A are about 1% of the total money raised: roughly $40k on $4M. Of course this doesn’t factor in the time for the process and the dilution of the investment. But if your startup is considering an IPO be prepared to pay eight times as much in fees. Across 360 venture backed technology IPOs in the last 10+ years which on average raised $107M 8.8% of the dollars the startup raises in the initial public offering is paid to investment banks accountants and attorneys. Below is a chart of the fee breakdown. Along the x-axis are calendar years. The y-axis shows the percent of the dollars raised which are immediately paid in fees. Investment banking/advisor fees are shown in red and receive the lion’s share. Legal fees primarily for writing the prospectus and ordering the company’s affairs and accounting fees for auditing and preparing the financials are marked in green and blue. The average fee hasn’t changed much in the past decade except for 2012. The blip in 2012 is an abberation caused by Facebook’s IPO which raised $17B and paid $182M in fees representing only 1% of the dollars raised. Facebook’s huge IPO and significantly lower fees raises the question do larger IPOs pay less in fees? The chart below which compares IPO size to the proportion of fees paid answers that question. The x-axis shows the IPO size in Log10 so the number 2 corresponds to $100M raised and the y-axis shows the fee share. Larger IPOs do command lower fees (the R^2 is about 0.44 indicating a moderate amount of correlation) but so do a handful of smaller IPOs like Google and Zynga among 18 others with fees less than 5% of the amount raise. Exceptional companies those that will likely do very well trading in the public market command lower fees because many providers are vying for the business and willing to reduce their margins to win the trophy customer. Going public has many benefits including access to far larger pools of capital greater share liquidity and PR. Among the costs involved in the process service provider fees are some of the most significant and sap nearly 10% of the proceeds. Published 2013-12-10,Published 2013-12-10
http://tomtunguz.com/perpetual-state-of-almost/,What You’re Making Is In A Perpetual State Of Almost Right Up Until The End,What You’re Making Is In A Perpetual State Of Almost Right Up Until The End Jason Fried co-founder of 37Signals and Basecamp published a blog post today called Faith in Eventually that captures the emotional tensions of building a product: During the development of most any product there are always times when things aren’t quite right. Times when you feel like you may be going backwards a bit. Times where it’s almost there but you can’t yet figure out why it isn’t. Times when you hate the thing today that you loved yesterday. Times when what you had in your head isn’t quite what you’re seeing in front of you. Yet. That’s when you need to have faith. My favorite line from the post is this one: Remember that what you’re making is in a perpetual state of almost right up until the end. Today many products are perpetually in a state-of-almost. Being in that state-of-almost means the product is living evolving changing and improving. Only when they sunsetted retired and shut down do they stop being in the state-of-almost - in other words complete. Years ago software development teams planned and feverishly coded their way to a final copy of the software called the General Availability version that would be burned onto a gold disc and then copied onto thousands of CDs or DVDs or distributed in some other fashion. At that point the product and engineering teams could plant a flag and claim to be done - at least for a while. But today most of the web and mobile software development is no longer managed this way. Many startups release new Generally Available versions of their software several times daily. At Redpoint we use RelateIQ for our CRM and the message “RelateIQ is out of date. Please refresh your browser” is a daily reminder of the efforts of the RelateIQ team to continuously improve the product. This rapid deployment pace places product and engineering teams continually in the state that Jason described in the first excerpt above - the struggle to create the perfect product. This idea is a really important one especially today. It’s the part of SaaS we don’t talk about very frequently the Service part service to the user. The very best products are the ones that are perpetually in a state-of-almost. They are the ones that rise to meet the needs of their users even as those needs change over time.

http://tomtunguz.com/sales-efficiency-vertical-horizontal-gtm/,Do Vertical SaaS Companies Benefit from Higher Sales Efficiency?,Do Vertical SaaS Companies Benefit from Higher Sales Efficiency? When writing the post Vertical SaaS Startups Require Different Go To Market Than Horizontal SaaS Companies I realized that there is a perception on my part and perhaps more broadly that vertical SaaS companies enjoy greater sales efficiencies than horizontal SaaS companies. After all vertical SaaS companies target a smaller number of potential buyers. The marketing team concentrates their media buys to target this audience the sales team focuses on a smaller lead list. Does the data support this notion? The point chart above compares the estimated sales efficiency of 54 publicly traded SaaS companies - 10 vertical in blue and 44 horizontal in red - for two years before IPO and three years after. It’s hard to discern a difference between the two. But if we chart the median by year we see that the vertical SaaS companies do exhibit a higher median for each of the years. Over this time period horizontal companies record a mean of 0.66 compared to 0.97 for vertical companies. And this difference is statistically significant (p value = 0.026) The chart of top 10 software companies by median sales efficiency shows that there is a healthy mix of both horizontal and vertical companies. Horizontal companies can also achieve terrific sales efficiencies. But the median horizontal company is less efficient. This may be because of a greater competitive pressure within the horizontal markets. Increased competition in a market segment drives up marketing costs reduces sales win percentage and decreases sales efficiency. After this analysis I compared a few other key metrics including revenue revenue growth net income sales & marketing spend as a percentage of revenue. Metric P Value Revenue 0.28 Revenue Growth 0.20 Net Income 0.26 Sales & Marketing/Revenue 0.54 Cash from Operations 0.59 Unlike sales efficiency none of these health metrics differ materially from vertical to horizontal SaaS companies. This may be because the number of vertical SaaS companies is relatively small still. Or more likely exceptionally efficient businesses can be built both with a horizontal and a vertical go-to-market strategy. For every Veeva there is also a Kenexa. Vertical software companies do benefit from a better sales efficiency. But it’s unclear what that efficiency translates into aside from lower sales and marketing costs. I would have suspected this efficiency would translate into better Cash from Operations implying vertical software companies require less capital to achieve the same revenue and growth but the data doesn’t yet support that thesis. I’m hopeful that with more vertical SaaS startups succeeding and growing quickly we will know more with time. Published 2015-09-17,Published 2015-09-17
http://tomtunguz.com/strikes-and-gutters/,Strikes and Gutters,Strikes and Gutters Among my friends in college a frequent response to the question “How’s it going?” was “Strikes and gutters.” In other words really well and really poorly - at the same time. Five years into the venture business I think that expression is much better suited to the day-to-day swings a startup experiences than the life of a college student. It’s hard to imagine these two diametric feelings at the same time but for entrepreneurs it’s a daily occurrence. Launch a new great product feature but lose a big customer. Grow really fast but struggle with fund raising. Get a lot of great press but fire an under-performer. At the beginning of most startups there are more gutters than strikes more down days than up days. And over the life of the startup each day presents an opportunity to start changing the ratio from mostly gutters and one or two strikes to one strike per gutter and so on. Hard work smart thinking and perseverance can win you that perfect game. Keep your head up after a few gutter balls. And celebrate your strikes. The most important part of the journey is to relentlessly pursue those pins. Published 2013-03-11,Published 2013-03-11
http://tomtunguz.com/saas-innovators-dilemma/,The Innovator's Dilemma for SaaS Startups,The Innovator's Dilemma for SaaS Startups See also: Innovator’s Solution for SaaS Startups There’s a familiar path now to SaaS companies that start in the SMB (small-to-medium business) part of the market. Over time they seem to inevitably begin serving larger customers. Box Hubspot Zendesk and among many others have exhibited this pattern. Why does this happen? I believe we’re seeing Clay Christensen’s Innovator’s Dilemma at play. In short new startups leverage a distribution advantage to acquire SMB customers at scale. These distribution advantages take many forms: a simpler product (Box vs Sharepoint); mobile app store distribution (Expensify vs Concur); content marketing (Zendesk vs Oracle/Peoplesoft). Early on the SMB customers finance a startup’s growth and enable the startup to build a broader product over time that eventually becomes more attractive to enterprises. Because of the nature of SMBs the startup must battle the higher churn rates of smaller customers which slow growth creating the S curve above. At some point the startup pursues the enterprise market to continue to achieve high growth rates with decreased customer churn. Smaller customers churn at higher rates. Below I’ve created a table that shows my general observations about customer account churn rates by segment. Segment Monthly Customer Churn % Annual Customer Churn % SMB 3-7% 31%-58% Mid-Market 1-2% 11%-22% Enterprise 0.5-1% 6%-10% SMB customers tend to go out of business more frequently than bigger businesses. They switch products more regularly because switching costs are low. They simply aren’t as reliable customers as bigger companies. So they churn and churn inhibits a business’s growth and demand the business invest more capital to continue growing at the same rates. At some point the total aggregate cost of the churn for an SMB business becomes so great that the company’s growth rate slows. It’s precisely then that a company should have an enterprise product in place. This is why the very largest enterprise software companies pursue the biggest customers; because they leverage the sales economies of larger accounts. Let’s contrast an inbound sales team at an SMB company and with an outbound sales team at an enterprise company where both companies spend the same per year in sales about $0.75M. Inside Outside Annual Investment $M 0.75 0.75 Total Compensation $k 75 250 Number of Reps 10 3 ARR Quota $k 500 2000 Total Quota Capacity $M 5.0 6.0 Customer Annual Churn 15% 7% 3 Year Value of Customer Base 1.1 5.2 3 Year Total Sales Production $M 10.9 15.6 The inside sales people are paid $75k and the outside $250k. That implies 10 inside reps and 3 outside reps. The inside reps carry $500k quota; outside carries $2M quotas. The inside sales team serves customers that churn at 15% per year compared to 7% for outside customers. If we calculate the value of each team’s customers over three years factoring in churn we see that the inside customers are worth $1.1M and the outside teams are worth $5.2M. Scaled for the number of sales people the outside sales teams’ customers generate 42% more revenue for the same investment. Some startups pursue the enterprise part of the market immediately. But this often requires building a substantial feature set before the company can sell their product. Rather than invest several years to build an enterprise product broad enough to compete many SaaS startups focus on the SMB part of the market. Small businesses have fewer demands and less sophisticated needs. Serving these customers finances the eventual development of an enterprise-grade product. The growth of the SMB customer base enables the company to grow revenues quickly and to raise its first few rounds of capital and may even fuel it all the way through IPO. As a startup’s revenue grows and its product broadens to appeal to enterprise customers the company can afford to trade the sales velocity and predictability of selling into the SMB and mid-market for the leverage and scale the enterprise market offers. At this point the startup cedes the SMB market creating an opportunity for a new entrant. The Innovator’s Dilemma starts all over again leading to a new cycle of innovation. Note: I’m making a broad generalization in this post. Intuit and Xero are great counter-examples of companies who have become enormous businesses purely focused on the SMB. But they are very much exceptions. In addition as Kenny van Zant points out there is a different class of company that uses the inside sales methods to target department level sales rather than SMBs in which case the sales efficiencies and churn rates described above don’t apply. Examples of this model include SolarWinds the place Kenny and his team pioneered the innovative high velocity inside sales model. Published 2015-04-09,Published 2015-04-09
http://tomtunguz.com/management-teams-are-interlocking-parts/,Great startup management teams are built with interlocking parts; The process; Matrix Multiplication,Great startup management teams are built with interlocking parts Great teams accomplish amazing things. But it’s rare for any founding team to have all the constituent parts on the day they start the company. Most startups will need to build a strong management team whose strengths and knowledge complement the founding team. Finding the right people to help starts with being honest. As Swizec of Zemanta wrote yesterday there simply isn’t enough time in the day for founders to manage all the key parts of a startup: BD hiring fundraising goal setting product management and company management in addition to coding. But words “building a management team” evoke anxiety in many founders I meet. Below is the process I’ve seen work well at many of our portfolio companies. The process Assessing the team The first part of building a management team is performing an honest assessment of the strengths weaknesses and personal goals of the founders. In other words “What kinds of people does this person need around him/her to be successful?” Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Great teams have individuals who complement each others weaknesses' with strengths - as a result they team becomes a force multiplier for the business. A founder may be a great technologist who is passionate about architecture and technology but needs help managing team. A founder may be a great salesperson and leader who wants to remain in the field and needs help managing product and engineering. A founder may be a great general manager but needs help scaling the business managing all the different parts of the company efficiently. Every situation is unique. But common to each the key element for growth is building a trusted team. Defining the role The second part of building the team is defining the ideal candidate’s strengths and weaknesses. These parameters fall out naturally from the founder strength assessment and the demands of the role. Often it’s helpful to speak with other founders who have hired similar candidates or hire an expert recruiter to guide the process and build a candidate pipeline. Easiest of all is to point to someone in the ecosystem and say “We want to hire someone exactly like that person!” Finding candidate/team fit Just like product/market fit candidate/team fit is the most important characteristic of building the management team. Open communication trust and shared vision are the sine qua non of a new management hire. They are essential. Management team candidates should spend lots of time with the company meeting as many of the team as possible in as many different environments as possible (team meetings offsites crises) to build rapport understanding and trust. Matrix Multiplication Management teams are the infrastructure upon which great companies are built. Underinvesting in them will hamper growth and leave founders scrambling to find the time to code design product and the six hundred other items on their task list. But laying the right foundation and making the right investments can drive exponential growth. Published 2012-12-13,Published 2012-12-13
http://tomtunguz.com/consumer-subscription-services/,The Internet Subscription Startup is Winning,The Internet Subscription Startup is Winning This week Netflix announced its US userbase grew to 31M subscribers surpassing HBO for the first time. The magnitude of Netflix’s milestone is hard to overstate. In a bid to compete with Netflix HBO has partnered with Comcast which serves 21M subscribers to trial an Internet-only subscription plus HBO the first time HBO is available to US consumers without a full cable subscription. It’s a clash of behemoths. Separately the NY Times revealed they have amassed more than 700000 digital subscribers who provide upwards of 20% of circulation revenues and grow about 40% year over year. The data flatly countermands arguments against the paywall when it launched two years ago. By my tally the number of streaming music customers in the US is on the order of 5M. Pandora has 2.5M Spotify has more than 1M; Apple Google Rdio and others likely sum to roughly the remaining million. If Spotify’s growth is any indication the market is growing at more than 100% per year. Across news music and television consumers have embraced digital subscription services. While this trend may seem like a foregone conclusion today the jury was out as recently as 24 months ago. And subscription services are spreading. The most recent example of this is the wave of monthly book-subscription services offered by Scribd Oyster and 24Symbols launched in the last month or two that provide access to a huge library of books for a monthly fee. Comixology provider of digital comic books and subscriptions counts more than 1M users and 200M comic book downloads. I think this is only the beginning because these models benefit both the consumers and the providers. Subscription services enable users to explore and discover. For service providers benefit from consistent revenue streams and negative working capital two very attractive financial characteristics well established in the Software-as-a-Service market. Excluding traditional media there aren’t many consumer subscription services of scale today. But I suspect there is a secular change in the way people consume media that will favor more consumer subscription services in the future. Published 2013-10-25,Published 2013-10-25
http://tomtunguz.com/twitter-content-recirculation/,Using Twitter Recirculation to Maximize Content Marketing Effectiveness,Using Twitter Recirculation to Maximize Content Marketing Effectiveness On this blog Twitter is the second largest source of traffic. Twitter yielded 21% of visitors in the last 30 days. Because I suspect that tweets containing my blog’s links don’t reach a very large proportion of my Twitter followers I’m experimenting with traffic recirculation techniques by retweeting older articles periodically. Of the approximately 150 posts on Svbtle I have recirculated 30. Recirculation encompasses the science and tactics of enticing users to read more articles during one session and also increase the number of visits to a site. Understanding recirculation is the key to maximizing the value of content. Below is a chart of the average number of retweets a post receives the first second and third time I tweet it. On average each subsequent attempt gains about 75% of the previous number of retweets - a very encouraging metric. Looking at the data more closely I noticed there are two segments of tweets: those with 1 to 3 initial retweets and those with 5 to 14 initial retweets. Recirculating a moderately successful post one with about 2 initial retweets results in about 2 more retweets. But recirculating a very successful post one with on average 9 retweets creates a cascade of another 4 retweets. This implies that the initial retweet count is likely a reasonable first-pass leading indicator of recirculation success. The correlation coefficient between the number of tweets during the first recirculation attempt and the second is strong at about 0.70. This suggests I should recirculate every post with greater than about 5 initial retweets programmatically. I suspect each publication given its individual characteristics like scale subject matter audience engagement has a certain recirculation pattern. Determining those segments and using the behaviors of those segments to inform recirculation is an essential part of maximizing the publication’s effectiveness. Also I suspect that recirculation data is the best way of understanding the type of content a publication’s audience prefers to read. Next I aim to research the relationship between retweets recirculation mail subscriptions keywords in a blog post and traffic. When the project is completed I’ll post the code.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-startup-benchmarks/,Six Key Benchmarks for Your SaaS Startup,Six Key Benchmarks for Your SaaS Startup One of the most frequent questions entrepreneurs ask me is how does their business compare to others? Benchmarking is a great tool if you can get access to representative data. Pacific Crest and David Skok have released a fantastic survey benchmarking SaaS metrics for early and growth stage companies. The entire report is well worth reading. Below is my list of the six most important benchmarks and observations from that report. Inside Sales Driven Companies Grow Fastest Inside sales driven distribution companies grow about 40% faster than companies using field sales web sales or channel or about 37% revenue growth per year. Price the Product Between $1k to $25k Annually to Optimize Growth Companies with contract sizes of $1k to $25k grow the fastest about 26% faster or 35% y/y. I suspect there are two reasons to support this pattern. First purchases under $25k tend to require fewer approvals which decreases sales cycle. Second these accounts can be closed by inside sales reps which are far less expensive than field sales. On the same sales investment a startup may be able to hire three or four inside sales reps for each field sales rep. Cost of Customer Acquisition is About 11 Months' of Revenue The median startup spends about 92% of first year average contract value on the sale implying an 11 month payback period on the CAC. An additional months' revenue is required to upsell a customer and about the same is required to close a renewal. Upsells are a Secret to Growing the Business Twice as Fast The top 50% of growers generate more upsell business than their slower growing competitors. The difference in growth rates becomes more pronounced as the business scales into the $15M+ in annual revenue range where upselling companies grow more than twice as fast. In the early days of the business net new account growth is a priority for most businesses but the growth rate data and CAC data indicate that upselling existing customers is an important and underemphasized key to growth. Sales commission as % of ACV 9% I’ve written about When to Hire Your First Sales Person and what a hypothetical compensation plan for sales people might look like. There I assumed the typical ACV/compensation ratio was about 4:1 but in practice that number is closer to 10:1. Median Monthly Revenue Churn is 0.75% Churn rates vary dramatically by product category and customer. SMBs churn with greater frequency than enterprises and marketing software has an intrinsically greater churn rate than accounting software so the median may be misleading for particular categories. This means each year the median business loses about 10% of its revenue to churning customers. Benchmarking is a great first order evaluation tool. It can answer the question of whether your startup is the ballpark of other companies. But it’s important to dig into the next step and understand where your startup’s variances exist from the median and why. It could be the sales compensation plan needs revision or it could be that you’ve captured lightning in a bottle and invented a new sales model. Published 2013-09-11,Published 2013-09-11
http://tomtunguz.com/evolution-of-intent/,Anticipatory Commerce: the Evolution of Intent on the Web,Anticipatory Commerce: the Evolution of Intent on the Web Intent to purchase is the engine of the consumer web. Creating and capturing intent motivates almost every dollar invested into ecommerce and advertising. Intent is also the fuel for the Internet’s most successful business model Google’s AdWords + Search. As the internet has evolved so have the ways of creating and capturing intent. From display to search to retargeting to collections each new technique has leveraged data in a novel form to discover consumers’ wishes. I believe we’re at the beginning of the next wave of mining that intent using anticipatory computing. In the mid and late 90s display advertising predominated. Search evolved and was perfected in the early 2000s. Search and search ads ushered in an era of measuring return on advertising spend. A dollar spent on ads could be proven to generate more than a dollar in sales. The user intent funnel looked like this: Then Quigo and Blue Lithium and others pioneered behavioral targeting/retargeting which uses information about users to target ads. As users traverse the internet they leave Hansel and Gretel breadcrumbs that reveal intent when aggregated. These breadcrumbs are most useful when fresh but become stale quickly. Behavioral targeting balanced the targeting of search with the breadth of display ads. In 2009 Pinterest and Houzz started providing tools for users to collect organize present and share things. Some subset of these collections are wishlists and to-buy lists which are very direct expressions of intent second only to search in value. Collection is today broadly adopted by tens of millions of users. This explicit intent-to-purchase data has never before been captured at scale. While the monetization of this intent is still arguably nascent the means to generate revenue from it is straightforward at this point affiliate sales or on-site commerce and the market opportunity before these companies is quite simply massive. Today we’re on the precipice of an entirely new way of doing so which I’m calling anticipatory computing. Anticipatory computing which is best demonstrated by Google Now pre-empts users with answers before users can ask questions. How long will it take to commute home? When will my Amazon Prime package arrive? What will the weather be today? Google Now tells me those things each day. Google Now is possible because of the gigantic amounts of user data created on the web. Those same technologies that drive answers to daily questions will be applied to uncovering intent and proactively prompting users to drive commerce. Today there are some early and crude concepts of this: notify me by when an item drops below a certain price or allow me to pre-purchase Grand Theft Auto 5 before release or send me a text message coupon when I walk past a BestBuy. I’m not sure precisely what anticipatory commerce will look like and how to solve the signal to noise ratio. But given the amount of data users have created using collections and breadcrumbs left on the web I’m hopeful we will see some tremendous innovation and some very large companies changing the way intent is harnessed on the web.

http://tomtunguz.com/fund-raising-is-much-more-than-a-transaction/,What I Learned From a Two-Year Fund Raising Process,What I Learned From a Two-Year Fund Raising Process Once each month I met Peter at Café Habana in Nolita for huevos rancheros drenched in tomato sauce and a glass of fresh orange juice. Mopping up yolks with tortillas Peter and I chatted about his business: the techniques of scalable customer acquisition the priorities of the product and engineering team the structure of sales quotas and the ebbing and flowing dynamics of the market place he and his team were building. After two years Peter called to say he was raising capital for his company; he invited us to take part in the process. I lept at the opportunity to work with Peter. I had witnessed how Peter managed adversity and uncertainty in his business and trusted his instincts and intuition. We had forged a working relationship over those breakfasts. During the fund raising process Peter encouraged me to spend time with his team. In parallel the Redpoint deal team researched the market opportunity heavily. Ultimately our investment memo totaled 40 pages laden with interviews of market place participants and industry experts. Then we began discussing terms. Peter negotiated terms aggressively and we shook hands on a partnership between AxialMarket and Redpoint in April 2012. In addition to having a special significance because of our friendship AxialMarket was my first investment at Redpoint where I would be point and a member of the board. A year into our partnership Peter and I still see each other at least once each month and have the same kinds of conversations we always shared. Sometimes those conversations occur in the board room instead of Cafe Habana. Reflecting on those two years I admire the way Peter managed his fundraising process: building a relationship evaluating our working styles and negotiating a fair set of terms. To be plain those twenty-four breakfasts were quite possibly the longest investor interview process in history. Peter understood from the very beginning that founders and investors work together for quite a while. The data confirms it: the median venture-backed company requires seven to ten years to reach an acquisition or IPO. Most importantly Peter showed me the value of building a long term relationship before seeking investment the importance of a shared passion for the business and the power of an alliance built on healthy strong and honest relationships between investors and founders. And to think it all started at a little Cuban place in Nolita over some rancheros… Published 2013-01-30,Published 2013-01-30

In about 30 minutes I had a working LinkedIn crawler built pulling the names of new followers new LinkedIn connections and LinkedIn status updates. All of that information is useful for me. But I just can’t seem to pull it from LinkedIn any other way. Crawling is the fastest easiest and best solution. Over the years I’ve used or built a number of crawlers: at Google to track competitive market share across ad networks at Redpoint to build a BD pipleine and to mine social networks and also mobile app store crawlers. Programmed well crawlers are the quick and dirty solution to aggregating data from the web at scale. Crawlers are one of the most powerful tools at the disposal of startups and I think some of the most underrated.

http://tomtunguz.com/hunter-thompson-goals/,We Must Strive to be Ourselves,We Must Strive to be Ourselves As I was researching the theory behind organizational goal-setting I came across a letter from Hunter Thompson at the time 20 years old writing to a friend about goals. Yesterday’s post discussed some frameworks for organizations to craft goals to maximize employee happiness and effectiveness. But Thompson’s advice is for our goals as individuals. To put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be at best unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen we do not strive to be bankers nor policemen nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES. But don’t misunderstand me. I don’t mean that we can’t BE firemen bankers or doctors—but that we must make the goal conform to the individual rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires—including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter. As I see it then the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal) he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development) and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires). In short he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. Thomson articulates beautifully how to enjoy the journey how to find meaning something which can be challenging as we are all pursuing the next milestone the next fund raise the next $1M in revenue the next promotion the next big thing. More than 50 years old Thomson’s letter conveys a timeless truth: whatever journey we choose whether heroic fireman startup founder venture capitalist or marketer we must to shape our goals to meet our need for fulfillment. We must strive to be ourselves first and foremost. Published 2015-07-23,Published 2015-07-23
http://tomtunguz.com/consumer-saas-capital-efficiency/,Benchmarking Consumer and SaaS Companies' Path to IPO,Benchmarking Consumer and SaaS Companies' Path to IPO Consumer companies on the whole tend to grow faster and do so will less spending on sales and marketing and research and development than SaaS companies. The chart above shows the revenue growth rates of 60 or so recent consumer and enterprise IPOs by years since founding. Enterprise/SaaS companies in the sample achieved very small revenue in their second year and grew consistently through year 8 at which point there’s a decline. Consumer companies on the other hand achieve much faster growth rates. In the second year I found four data points: Zulily Groupon Zynga and Millennial Media. The median revenue of those businesses in year 2 was over $100M. Simply explosive growth. And this trend continues throughout the chart with three sawtooth spikes tracing the massive growth of other consumer companies. Amazingly enough consumer companies are able to achieve these growth rates with less R&D spend and less Sales & Marketing spend than their SaaS counterparts. The two charts above contrast the consumer and enterprise Sales & Marketing trends. In short over the first ten years of a company’s life consumer companies spend about 31% of revenue on sales and marketing while SaaS companies spend 52%. The same trend is true in R&D where consumer companies allocate 15% of their revenues compared to 22% for SaaS companies. There are likely many different causes for these large disparities. First consumer product can be much simpler than enterprise products. Security compliance data compatibility are never issues consumers raise when downloading an app. But many software buyers do. Second the sales process for enterprise products is consequently less efficient and more costly. Consequently software companies must allocate more time and money to those sales processes. Third enterprise products haven’t yet found a way to benefit from the tremendous distribution platforms like email mobile app stores and social networks the way consumer companies have. Given those figures why aren’t more of the billions VCs invest allocated to consumer companies? Today software companies capture about 60% of all US venture dollars and growing. Not captured in the analysis here are success rates of businesses. I wish I had some data on the success rates of consumer and enterprise startups because we could create an expected value for a dollar invested in each category. That analysis would be worth its weight in gold. Published 2014-08-19,Published 2014-08-19
http://tomtunguz.com/second-seed-patterns/,Five Charts on the Second Seed Market,Five Charts on the Second Seed Market About two years ago we examined the new Second Seed a tactic employed by startups who raise an initial seed round achieve a set of milestones and raise a second seed round before raising a series A. During the two years since that analysis this trend has continued. In the last 24 months Second Seeds have grown From 7.5% to 18% of US technology seed rounds both in number and in dollars invested according to Crunchbase data. And this growth in share is doubly impressive because the overall number of seats has been growing at about 49% annually. Second Seeds have been growing at twice that rate at 94%. Second seed rounds historically have been larger than First Seed rounds. In 2015 the median Second Seed round hit $1 million compared to $800k for First Seeds. However there is no statistical difference between the two. In other words second seeds are not always larger than first seeds. The box plot above shows the changing distribution of second seeds by size. While the median remains relatively constant the number of outliers marked by dots has increased. The chart indicates that in some cases second seeds are Series A by another name. Interestingly there are no investors in the Crunchbase data set that focus exclusively on second seeds. In other words Second Seed dollars are provided by First Seed investors. This is probably because Second Seeds are most often invested in companies that are doing well but need a little bit more capital to reach the milestones to raise a substantial series A. So the existing investors possibly in addition to one or two other seed investors double down on the business to see it through. The first chart which shows the increasing concentration of the seed market in Second Seeds supports this hypothesis. Once a startup indicates some initial success existing investors seek to buy more of the business. In addition the 9 month difference between the first and second seed rounds a difference that has been increasing over the past three years supports the idea that Second Seeds are used to continue to develop momentum before the Series A. Whatever you call the Second Seed I suspect it’s a financial product that is here to stay. Representing almost a fifth of the seed market it’s also likely to become increasingly common.

http://tomtunguz.com/marketing-disciplines/,What to Look for When Hiring a Head of Marketing for Your Startup,What to Look for When Hiring a Head of Marketing for Your Startup When a startup is confronted with the prospect of hiring a head of marketing founders heads often spin. What should be the day-to-day tasks for this person? What skill sets are important? Because of the seeming abstract nature of marketing founders sometimes delay finding a head of marketing until they feel acute pain at which point they can clearly identify the attributes of the right candidate. But underinvestment in marketing like underinvestment in infrastructure or software or product isn’t a good idea. As a few of the companies I work with have sought to hire heads of marketing I’ve been working through similar questions of how to define and describe the characteristics of the right marketing hire. There are three distinct marketing skillsets to weigh when hiring a head of marketing: marketing communications quantitative marketing and product marketing. Marketing Communications - aka MarCom is the team reponsible for the brand and the voice of the company in the market place. Marcom teams typically create sales collateral white papers the content for content marketing event materials and so on. Marcom is the least frequently employed skillset in startups because the effectiveness of the team is very difficult to quantify. Marcom is the mushy work most people associate with marketing. But the lack of metrics doesn’t diminish the value or impact of the team’s work. Marcom teams interact quite a bit with Public Relations (internal or external). Quantitative Marketing - aka growth hacking is the team reponsible for marketing qualified leads (MQL). These teams are by nature technical often performing significant data analysis to maximize return-on-investment of their marketing spend. For consumer startups like gaming companies quantitative marketing teams buy ads across networks test different creatives often supplied by marcom or another team and then optimize this process. In enterprise startups the quantitative marketing teams are also called demand generation teams. They field inbound calls and inquiries and also make outbound calls to drum up meetings with potential customers. These leads are passed to the sales teams. Quantitative Marketing teams are most closely aligned with sales. Product Marketing - Though there are many different flavors of product marketing. In this case I use the term the way Apple defines product marketing. Before launch product marketers analyze the customer base: demographics interests needs segmentations willingness-to-pay etc. This data informs the product and engineering roadmap. Once the product is launched product marketers position the product in the market price and discount it and own the commercial success of the launch. Product marketers work closely with product managers and engineering leaders at the beginning of a product’s lifecycle and then with MarCom and Quantitative Marketing teams after launch. By dividing the marketing skill set into these three buckets and deciding which skillset is the most important and which are nice-to-haves it’s easier to identify the best head of marketing candidate for a particular role. The key to hiring the right marketing person is to match the needs of the company with a candidates skills. Distilling the needs of the company into these three skillsets helps dispel the amorphous fog around the word marketing. Published 2014-02-20,Published 2014-02-20
http://tomtunguz.com/shifting-role-marketing-saas/,The Expanding Role of Marketing in SaaS Companies,The Expanding Role of Marketing in SaaS Companies The role of the marketing team within SaaS has stretched from simply engendering awareness and creating interest to guiding customers much deeper into the funnel. Steve Patrizi created the schematic above that illustrates the idea beautifully. In traditional go-to-market models marketing teams fill the very top part of the funnel. When a potential customer enters the consideration phase of the buyer journey the marketing team transitions the lead to his sales account executive who educates the customer from the consideration stage through purchase. In the new model marketing shepherds the customer from awareness through some portion of product evaluation. In freemium products marketing cares for the customer through most of the product evaluation stage at which point either customer success or sales closes the deal. In higher price point sales sales picks up the customer after the customer indicates an intent to purchase. In either case marketing ushers customers through substantially more of the funnel than in the past. This change has three important ramifications for SaaS startups. First the scope of marketing activities has broadened significantly. The most sophisticated marketing plans today deploy at least nine disciplines which range from content marketing to evangelist recruitment to customer lifecycle marketing to cohort conversion analysis. B2B marketing has become radically more complex. Consequently marketing team sizes should grow as a fraction of total team size in newer model software companies Second the marketing budget marketing will swell to match this expanding responsibility. In 2014 Gartner predicted Chief Marketing Officers would control more budget than Chief Information Officers by 2017 and the initial data shows the trend to be accurate. This substantial shift of dollars has led to an explosion in the number of startups and product serving the CMO. The most recent landscape for marketing products totaled more than 2000 alternatives. I expect to see many more startups chasing CMO dollars. Third the new expanse of marketing disciplines demands that the ideal head of marketing be informed and adept at each able to recruit team members and evaluate performance. Of course very few candidates will be able to claim mastery in each of the disciplines. So it is incumbent for each startup to determine which of the disciplines is most important given the goals and the stage of the business. The advantages of the high velocity software go to market are hard to overstate. These companies build more defensible faster moving and more capital efficient businesses. With those advantages come the trade-off of additional complexity in the marketing department. But managed well they can lead to exceptionally successful startups.

http://tomtunguz.com/how-much-should-your-startup-spend-on-managing-churn/,How Much Should Your Startup Spend on Managing Churn?,How Much Should Your Startup Spend on Managing Churn? It’s an important question and one that arises most often as a SaaS startup scales. Churn masked by growth becomes a limiting factor of growth. How much should the business invest in managing churn? Our SaaS benchmarks from earlier this week tell us the average public SaaS company has a 3% monthly revenue churn or a 2 year lifetime and a sales efficiency of 0.8 which implies a 5 quarter pay back period on cost-of-sales and cost-to-serve. Using those numbers the contribution revenue chart for a typical customer looks like this. The revenue of the first 15 months pays for the acquisition costs and the remaining 9 months before the customer churns are contribution margin. Presuming the business signs customers to 12 month contracts a customer who renews pays a year’s worth more of contribution margin minus the customer success team’s salaries. To be worth the investment customer success must drive at least drive one more month’s worth of margin in addition to the 9 created by the standard 2 year-and-out customer. Assume a customer success team can save 30% of customers who are at risk. In the success case then the contribution revenue chart looks like this: For the remaining 2/3 of cases the chart looks like this: But on average the customer success team saves about 4 months of contribution margin per customer which means company can spend up to 3 months' worth of contribution per customer on churn management. For a company at a $3M annual recurring revenue clip with customer ARRs of $1k there are 3000 customers. On each the company could spend about $156 (which is the $83 in revenue per customer multiplied by an average gross margin of 63% in SaaS companies' early years) to save or a customer success budget of $39k per month. Of course each company’s metrics will vary and will impact the maximum spend on customer success but the framework should hold across most subscription businesses.

http://tomtunguz.com/consumerization-of-it-is-happening/,The Sudden Shift in SaaS Product Pricing,The Sudden Shift in SaaS Product Pricing One of the most important forces in SaaS today is the Consumerization of IT. Instead of a centralized IT organization deciding which products to buy product managers and marketers and engineers and data scientists determine which products they think would serve them best and buy them directly often using a credit card. This movement is transformative and its impact is immediate. The chart above plots the median Average Revenue per Customer by Year of IPO for the 50 SaaS companies that have gone public in the past five years. The typical SaaS company going public in the last three years has a 77% smaller average revenue per customer than companies in 2010 – 2011. In the past four years two companies went public with average revenue per customer of less than $1000 (RNG WIX); and another four went public with less than $10000 typical customer sizes (ZEN HUBS FLTX NEWR). In contrast 2011 companies logged a median customer value of $96000. When these newer cohorts of companies have gone public they have roughly four times the number of customers paying one-fourth the price of their older brothers. Consumerization of IT is an incredibly powerful trend for SaaS startups for three reasons. First it exhorts startups to build better products which are easy to use and provide immediate value. Second this trend demands the the sales process evolve from an education sale to an execution sale from a push to a pull sales process where customer support and success meaningfully reduce cost of customer acquisition. Buyers educate themselves with online materials and through product trials (perhaps some contact with support) before ever contacting the sales team contrary to the traditional enterprise sales process where outbound sales dominates. Third consumerization of IT enables SaaS startups to acquire customers far more cost-effectively than in the past which means they need less capital to grow just as big. The Consumerization of IT trend isn’t going to reverse. Buyers prefer buying this way - it provides them more control and less financial exposure. There are no longer locked into large companywide contracts with particular vendors. In addition startups benefit by reducing their capital needs and creating faster more repeatable sales processes that often look more like B2C sales than B2B. The impact is dramatic and startups have no incentive to reverse course. Over the last three years consumerization of IT has made an enormous impact on SaaS startups. The first three IPO classes of companies benefiting from this trend have demonstrated billion dollar companies can be built using these techniques. And I’m certain over the next few years we will see many many more building businesses on larger numbers of smaller customers. Published 2015-01-05,Published 2015-01-05
http://tomtunguz.com/saas-stock-based-compensation/,Benchmarks for Employee Stock Based Compensation in SaaS Startups,Benchmarks for Employee Stock Based Compensation in SaaS Startups How much should your startup budget for its employee stock option pool? One way of answering this question is a blanket addition per year say a 2% renewal. Another way is to look at the cash based cost of the stock based compensation. We’re going to examine the second one today by looking at the basket of 50+ SaaS companies. The chart above shows the average stock-based compensation (SBC) per employee by years since founding across the basket of publicly traded SaaS companies. Each blue dot is a data point and the red line is a polynomial regression (loess) to show the trend. In summary each year the typical public SaaS company spends about $10-20k in stock based compensation per employee. The number is higher when a company is younger and there is a more risk and employees must be compensated with commensurately more equity. The figure dips when the startup begins to gain momentum but is before IPO a period when the appreciation of a grant is more certain. At IPO typically in year 7 the compensation rises again because option value increases will likely be more muted than before IPO since the company’s shares are marked to market every day. The SBC investment pattern varies substantially by company. Above I’ve plotted the median spend on stock-based compensation over the first ten years of each company’s life. NewRelic tops the list at over $25k and ExactTarget is the smallest at below $5k. Many factors skew the investments. Geography (in certain geographies employee value cash over stock) competitiveness of the talent market (more competitive markets create greater stock based incentives) the number of executive hires in a year (executive grants can be quite large e.g. 8% for a new CEO) and other factors can substantially impact the average spend on SBC. It’s also important to note that the distribution of stock grants is governed by a power law. The founders and executives often hold a substantial fraction of common stock. Because of the skew in the distribution the average SBC (stock based compensation) figure I’ve depicted above doesn’t necessarily represent the amount given to an average employee. Additionally the value of the SBC isn’t necessarily an accurate representation of the value of the grant because in all these cases options and stock granted in the early years appreciated meaningfully. I’ve plotted the growth in share price by round for nine public companies in this post. In some cases share prices increased by more than 50x in just a few years. The SBC value reported in a companies financial statements are the 409a valuation data. 409as are independent valuations of company stock that startups perform every 6-12 months depending on the stage of the company. If you’re curious to probe the depths of stock based compensation accounting PwC has a great SBC guide here. Managing your startup’s cap table is an important skill. This discipline is increasingly important in competitive job markets for attracting and retaining talent. Published 2015-02-02,Published 2015-02-02
http://tomtunguz.com/if-you-chase-two-rabbits/,If You Chase Two Rabbits...,If You Chase Two Rabbits... Founders often ask when is the right time to expand geographically add a second product or pursue another customer segment? Most of the time the answer is not yet not until the company is quite large perhaps in the hundreds of employees and the main challenges and questions for the business have been answered well. When a startup pursues a new major initiative the company divides all its key teams by two. If speed and focus are the advantages of startups then this startup has halved its focus and doubled execution time. There are now two marketing messages two sales pitches two press strategies two product and engineering teams. Rationalizing two messages can be a challenge for companies to communicate and customers to internalize. For most small companies’ management teams and employees this doubling of complexity is overwhelming. Second the company risks slowing its core business. If the company is doing well enough to pursue a second product strategy the business is onto something. Founders should ask whether faster growth and dominance in one market segment builds a more valuable business than smaller penetration of and slower growth in two markets. Most of the time and particularly in early stage markets a focused startup perceived to be on the path to monopolizing a market will be more valuable. Third the startup’s goals are no longer necessarily aligned among teams. After all which product takes precedence when cash is constrained press releases are numbered and customer time is capped? The startup will constantly need to decide which to prioritize - and at early stages this balancing act is quite a lot to manage. If you chase two rabbits both will escape. Pick one and seize it.

http://tomtunguz.com/when-to-go-freemium/,The Common Characteristics of Successful Freemium Companies,The Common Characteristics of Successful Freemium Companies Is there a common characteristic of successful freemium companies? Piotr asked this question earlier this week. This is the framework I’ve seen work well for freemium startups. At its core freemium is a novel marketing tactic that entices new users and ultimately potential customers to try a product and educate themselves about its benefits on their own. By shifting the education workload from a sales team to the customer the cost of sales can decrease dramatically. So freemium can be a huge strategic advantage in a competitive market because those companies that successfully implement freemium can scale faster and more efficiently than traditional sales-driven companies might. Successful freemium companies do three things: First they use free to market educate and win mindshare. The nature of sales processes is evolving as Daniel Pink eloquently argued in his book To Sell is Human. The Internet enables potential customers to research products much more deeply before engaging with a sales person. Freemium is the ultimate embodiment of that change because customers can use the product before buying it. Second freemium startups leverage usage data to improve their product. The large amount of users using the product enables A/B testing with statistical significance a non-trivial strategic advantage. Marketing teams can sift through the data to understand market segmentation and funnel efficiency and product management can parse the data to improve the on-boarding experience. Third freemium startups gather information about their customer base to prioritize their sales efforts. When customers sign up or download a free product freemium companies should gather data about the user to understand who they are and analyze the usage patterns of these users. With enough user data it’s possible to predict with great accuracy which users will become large accounts. Yammer employed this tactic to prioritize leads for the inside sales team with great results. The measure of success of a freemium campaign is revenue aka converting a user to a paid customer. There are many different sales movements triggers to generate some value from a user. But I bucket them this way: Convert a free user to a paid user in exchange for certain advanced features or more of the product eg Evernote charges for offline access Dropbox charges for more storage. Win several users in a team and leverage the social proof to convert a team or department though inside sales. I’ve called this the Two Step Value Proposition eg Yammer wins the end user and converts the IT admin who seeks control over the app Expensify wins the expense reporter with a mobile app but ultimately converts the finance team of a company to paid by offering policy management. Leverage one free user to win many other free or paid users. In some cases lots of free users increase a company’s rank and visibility in the app store attracting customers. In other cases incentivized referral programs like Dropbox’s enable free users to continue to free-ride in exchange for driving revenue from others. A nice quid-pro-quo. Freemium models can be attractive but they don’t work in every case. Startups should consider freemium when three conditions are met: the number of potential users numbers in the tens of millions free distribution is a competitive advantage in the market the product downloaded by a free user has a simple and straightforward value proposition and the marginal cost to serve a user is negligible. Freemium conversion funnels tend to be very lossy. On average 1-4% of users convert to paid so a startups needs a huge number of users to be able to drive meaningful revenue from a single-digit percentage of users. To reach $100M in annual revenue a freemium business charging $100 per year with a 4% conversion-to-paid rate would need a total user base of 25M users. Because the freemium model relies on customers to educate themselves freemium is best used as distribution advantage in established markets with incumbents who bear large customer-acquisition costs. An ancillary benefit freemium companies can draft behind the sales and marketing efforts of the incumbent behemoths. Initially freemium startups often serve a smaller customer segment but can address them more profitably than the incumbent could as a result of a more efficient sales process. Because customers are educating themselves freemium products have a very short window of attention to seize and convince a user to convert to paid. Therefore the product has to be straight to the point and solve an immediate need or eliminate pain. Most important the marginal cost of supporting a free user must be close to negligible. If the cost-to-serve a free user is significant the freemium model will demand lots of cash to support hordes of free users and this growth path can be unsustainable if a startup really must acquire 25M users for example. Freemium doesn’t work for many different businesses but deployed the right way freemium marketing strategies can be a hugely strategic weapon for startups. Published 2014-05-30,Published 2014-05-30

Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki said it best in his book Zen Mind Beginner’s Mind: If your mind is empty it is always ready for anything it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities but in the expert’s mind there are few. Anyone can have an open mind a beginner’s mind - so a great entrepreneur can come from anywhere.

http://tomtunguz.com/startup-acquihire-trends/,Trends in the Startup Acquihire Market,Trends in the Startup Acquihire Market After writing about the Seed Market in 2015 I wondered whether I could find some data to support Sam Altman’s observation that acquihires have fallen in frequency over the past year by 66-75%. The chart above shows an estimate of the acquihires in US technology companies over the past four years. There is no perfect data set on acquihires because many of these transactions are never announced. So this estimate which I created using Crunchbase data likely underestimates the total number of acquihires in every period. To calculate the data I filtered all the startups who had been acquired for undisclosed amounts and raised less than $6.5M (the sum of the average seed round in 2014 and the median series A). Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Acquihires 59 64 67 68 61 Over the past four years on average 15 companies are acquihired each quarter. And on an annual basis the cadence of acquihires is steady in the high 60s. 2014 saw a modest drop to 61. As the chart above shows the three first quarters of the year exceeded the average and Q4 recorded ten. This drop could be an actual decrease. Or it could be caused by a delay in the announcement of these acquisitions. Wrapping up the paperwork can take time. If the data does hold then there would seem to be a decline in acquihires but that decline isn’t unprecedented. Q2 2010 Q2 2011 and Q2 2012 all saw similar drops before the levels rebounded. In fact Q2 is consistently the slowest quarter in each year excluding 2014 possibly due to the impact of summer vacation. However there is a consistent pattern elsewhere in the acquihire market. Startups are raising less and less before being acquired. The line above charts the slow but consistent decline in the median amount raised by the acquihired companies. In 2010 the median was in the $3-4M range. In 2014 that figure is in the $1-2M range. This may indicate a new strategy by the acquirers’ corporate development teams. Instead of acquiring companies after the Series A as they did in 2010 and 2011 these corp dev groups are pursuing talented companies after the seed. Because there are fewer investor dollars in these acquirers may be able to pay less for the same talent. Or perhaps the acquihire market has grown more competitive and corp dev teams acquire earlier. Or perhaps startups founders understand better when their idea or technology or team is better suited as part of a larger entity sooner. There is no great data set to analyze the acquihire market. But these estimates from Crunchbase indicate that the acquihire market slowed a very small amount in 2014 caused by a deceleration in Q4. The competition talent market shows no signs of slowing down and competition fuels the acquihire market. Unless there’s a material change in talent or a set of new acquisition strategies employed by the big technology companies I don’t expect much of a change in 2015.

http://tomtunguz.com/zendesk-ipo/,Benchmarking Zendesk's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking Zendesk's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Zendesk is a 700 person company that builds customer support software. Zendesk went public earlier this year. It’s a remarkable business primarily because the founders and the team have built an incredibly efficient customer acquisition funnel. It’s important to note that Redpoint is an investor in and shareholder of the company. In the next seven charts we’ll explore how Zendesk built their business. We will explore revenue growth average revenue per customer sales efficiency payback periods net income gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots I’ve used Zendesk’s colors as a consistent legend. Zendesk company data is green median values are black and other company values are gray. All the data come from Zendesk’s S-1. Zendesk has matched the SaaS median for revenue growth each year and slightly exceeded it in 2013. The company has achieved a 114% CAGR from 2011 through 2013 an impressive growth rate. In fact Zendesk is the 10th fastest growing SaaS company reaching about $70M of revenue in its sixth year since founding. LOGM TLEO LNKD and ZEN achieved the same scale of revenue at the same time relatively speaking. Setting the standard Salesforce recorded more than $300M in its sixth year. Zendesk’s gross margin which is Revenue minus Cost-of-Revenue (customer support infrastructure team and expenses and also the compensation expenses typical at IPO) divided by revenue has exceeded the median fro the past few years and is converging to the median of about 70%. This means Zendesk’s costs of providing their service are lower than typical SaaS publics. In gross dollar terms Zendesk burns more cash to grow than the average SaaS company. In the past two years Zendesk recorded net losses of about $23-24M each year while the typical SaaS public burns about $13-14M. But because Zendesk’s revenue has been growing so quickly the gross net income figure as a fraction of total revenue is identical to the median SaaS publicly traded company. So Zendesk’s spending is actually in line with other SaaS publics on a relative basis. This spending is broken into two main categories: R&D and S&M. Zendesk has historically spent more than the median on Research and Development (R&D)/Engineering. I suspect part of this might have to do with the vast number of integrations with their customer service suite. By becoming the data repository for customer interactions from email social media CRMs bug tracking and all other types of software both accelerates sales cycles and leverages partners to grow. Some might argue that the relatively heavier investment in R&D should reduce the need for Sales & Marketing expense. But that’s not the case here. Zendesk’s S&M outlay as a percentage of revenue matches the median. This means Zendesk spends as much as the typical public SaaS company to acquire new customers. But here’s the kicker: the investments in both R&D and S&M which are substantial enable spectacular sales efficiency. A sales efficiency of 0.8 means a company must spend $1M in Sales and Marketing to generate $0.80 in revenue. In 2012 the company posted a sales efficiency of 1.4 and in 2013 a figure of 1.0 compared to 1.1 and 0.71 for the median. This means for the same spend as a typical public SaaS company Zendesk acquires at least 25% more revenue. This sales efficiency is enabled by the combination of a great product terrific sales and in particular community marketing within the customer support world. Today referrals provide more than 40% of Zendesks’ traffic about 10 percentage points more than direct visitors - an amazing figure for a B2B product. Ticker Year Since Founding Gross Profit in $M Sales Efficiency VEEV 5 72.5 3.3 XERO 5 2.6 1.9 WDAY 5 40.5 1.7 DWRE 5 5.9 1.7 ZEN 5 25.0 1.4 Putting the sales efficiency figures into context ZEN is the fifth most efficient SaaS business I’ve measured. Five years since founding Zendesk recorded a sales efficiency of 1.4. The table above compares the other top SaaS companies by sales efficiency in year five. Veeva is an amazing outlier a product of a very high average customer value and very few customers. Notably DemandWare and Xero achieved the number on far smaller gross profit figures. Any way you measure it Zendesk is one of the most efficient SaaS businesses yet. Amazingly Zendesk is able to achieve this efficiency with one of the smallest average revenue per customer figures in the market of about $1800 across 40000 customers when they filed their S-1. Like HubSpot Zendesk has been able to create efficient customer acquisition channels to amass a huge customer base upon which they’ve built a terrific business.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-ipo-trends/,Why There's Never Been a Better Time to Found a SaaS Startup,Why There's Never Been a Better Time to Found a SaaS Startup SaaS companies are the darlings of the public market. The average publicly traded SaaS company enjoys twice as strong a revenue multiple as ten years ago. SaaS companies’ time to IPO has been decreasing steadily from over 10 years since founding to under 7. Despite the decrease in time to IPO the average dollars raised at IPO has tripled from the early nineties and grown by 50% since 2000. I analyzed the 41 publicly traded SaaS companies comparing to understand the trends in SaaS IPO. The data set is here. Here are four charts depicting the trends. The average SaaS company trades at a 11x enterprise value to revenue multiple up from 6x in 2006. It’s impossible to ascribe this multiple expansion to a single cause. It could be the growth rates of the companies in this basket the relative attractiveness of this category compared to other stocks a better comprehension of the value of these companies by public market investors or the opposite! In any case valuations for SaaS companies in the public market are at ten-year highs. The time commitment required to become a publicly traded company has decreased by third from about 12 years in 1995 to about 7 today. Some of this downward pressure on time-to-IPO may be because a company founded in 2008 needing ten years to go public hasn’t had the chance to appear in the data set. To improve this analysis it would be useful to look at the 2014 IPO pipeline. Despite the decrease in time the average size of a SaaS IPO has been steadily increasing by $7M per year. Some part of this is due to multiple expansion mentioned above. Other hypotheses include startups leveraging more efficient sales channels (Veeva and Salesforce for example) more venture dollars raised to finance growth or even a changing customer base more receptive to SaaS offerings. Curiously enough the average size of an IPO doesn’t change with age. I wondered if some companies waited a few extra years to raise larger IPOs but the data doesn’t show that to be the case. The median offering size is statistically equivalent over quite a range times. For a boxplot showing this distribution click here. All in all there’s never been a better time to start a SaaS company or take one public. Valuation multiples are healthy growth rates are strong and the time to IPO is decreasing. Quite an exciting time to be a SaaS entrepreneur! Published 2014-03-11,Published 2014-03-11
http://tomtunguz.com/five-forces-shaping-fundraising-market/,The Five Forces Shaping the Fundraising Market,The Five Forces Shaping the Fundraising Market Last week the team at Wharton in San Francisco invited me to speak at the Entrepreneurs Workshop. I chose the topic of the “Five Forces Shaping the Fundraising Market” and prepared a Mary Meeker style presentation with a chart and a bullet point on each slide to illustrate the forces in tension. It was great fun. I’ve embedded the slides from the presentation above and will link to the video once it’s live. To help provide some context to charts I’ve summarized the five forces below. These are the five major forces shaping the fundraising market today: The Fundraising Market is Stable Despite Public Market Fluctuations. The dollars in and out of the venture market are relatively constant. LPs are investing into venture capital at a steady and likely increasing rate. Over the last five years dollars into the venture industry has remained at or below the 12 year median. 2014 looks to be a bit of a stronger year. VCs are investing at a relatively constant pace and at a relatively constant average dollars per investment. The public market correction in consumer and enterprise stocks in February was real and significant deflating consumer by 25% and enterprise by 40%+. Many of those companies have rebounded some since the lows but institutional investors have broadly cycled from growth to value stocks. Valuations may be more varied but total capital invested in startups is constant. Startups are Much More Capital Efficient than they Were Ten Years Ago. Startups require 50% of the capital of 12 years ago to become publicly traded companies or reach twice the revenue on the same dollars invested. Some outliers are substantially much more efficient than that. This efficiency is driven by lower cost-of-customer acquisition because of better acquisition channels and lower infrastructure costs. For the Most Attractive Startups Seed Rounds Have Replaced Series As. Seed investment dollars have tripled in 4 years driven mostly by VCs. When VCs participate in seed rounds round sizes are on average 3x larger. VC seed round sizes have continued to grow by about 10% each year since 2010 and the number of MegaSeeds i.e. those seeds greater than $2M has grown by 5x in 3 years. Series Bs Are The Hardest Rounds to Raise. The growth in seed rounds and seed stage companies has expanded the number of companies raising Series A. The Series A market has responded somewhat. Total Series As have roughly doubled as seed volumes have tripled. But Series B rounds have remained flat. Because the capital allocated to Series Bs has remained flat competition is increasing for those dollars and follow-on success rates have fallen. Growth Stage MegaRounds Have Replaced or Delayed IPOs. Megarounds private market investments similar in size to typical tech IPOs of $75-200M have become increasingly common growing by 3x+ over the last four years. This capital enables larger startups to delay IPO and the regulatory overhead accompanying it. The fundraising market is stable because today the many forces in tension dollars in dollars-out exits competition and the public market all balance out. I’m hopeful we won’t see a significant change in the market for a while. But if/when we do it will be because one of these forces suffers a discontinuous change.

http://tomtunguz.com/nps-benchmarks/,Four Important Data Points on Measuring Your Startup's Customer Happiness,Four Important Data Points on Measuring Your Startup's Customer Happiness At some point most startups will begin to measure their customers’ happiness. Customer satisfaction is an important predictor of loyalty and can foster fantastically efficient word-of-mouth growth. Many companies employ Net Promoter Score to quantify customer satisfaction. NPS measures the fraction of a customer base which are promoters and detractors of a company’s product. I’ve been told that NPS scores greater than 50 are impressive but this is simply a rule of thumb. So what’s the right way to evaluate a company’s NPS report? Zendesk recently published NPS benchmarks that are quite useful to interpret NPS scores. These are the four most interesting data points I found in the report: Median NPS Score by Type of Company B2C 32 B2B 29 Internal 49 First the mean NPS across the 230 companies is 29. But this average varies across customer types. The table above shows B2B customers are less satisfied and loyal than B2C customers. Internal customers for example employees served by internal IT teams are the happiest of all. These averages support the rule of thumb that a score of 50 is terrific. (To calculate an NPS score subtract the 26% detractors from the 55% promoters yielding a 29 NPS.) Second customer NPS responses follow a bimodal distribution. As you can see in the chart above users tend to respond very positively (9 or 10) or very negatively (0). 65% of the responses fit into these three buckets. Additionally I was surprised to learn that middle-of-the-road scores indicate customers are highly likely to be detractors. Third the data confirms that changing a customer’s feeling about a company is very difficult. More than 70% of surveyed users who gave a negative review in the past remain critics. The converse is also true but to a lesser extent. Previously endorsers of a product degrade to detractors about 18% of the time. Last as startups’ user bases expand they are are challenged to keep on exceeding user expectations. But companies can maintain relatively consistent satisfaction scores despite massive increases in customer tickets. The chart above shows the mean customer satisfaction score by the average number of monthly tickets. High throughput service desks observe about 20% lower customer satisfaction than embryonic volume desks. Zendesk maintains an extensive library of benchmarks containing useful insights and benchmarks for startups seeking to deeply understand a customer’s needs and develop a passionate user base the same way Zendesk has. If you’re looking to understand how your startup performs relative to others it’s a great place to start. Published 2014-10-29,Published 2014-10-29
http://tomtunguz.com/3-dimensions-of-content-marketing/,The Three Dimensions of Content Marketing Strategy for Startups,The Three Dimensions of Content Marketing Strategy for Startups If I were asked to create a content marketing strategy for a person or a business from scratch I would craft a strategy with three dimensions: customer segments customer lifecycle stage and content type. **Customer Segments: **Product managers/marketers are responsible for identifying the most important customer segments a startup will pursue. Picking the right customer segments increases profitability maximizes market size and prioritize the most attractive customer for the business. Very few businesses target only one type of customer. Market places cater to buyers and sellers. SaaS companies may pursue small medium and enterprise customers many times across industry categories. Even pure consumer businesses like social networks can divide their user bases into celebrities influencers and the common user for example. Content marketing efforts must reflect the core strategy of the business and prioritize the most important few segments. The content a startup produces must resonate with these target segments. It’s not to say each blog post or tweet must strike a chord with every segment each time but that there ought to be some content for targeting each segment specifically. Customer Lifecycle: Before buying a product a customer progresses through a journey. They educate themselves about a space to understand whether they have a need. They understand the key attributes of products in the sector. Next they make a buying decision. Then they may try to maximize the value of the product. Last the customer may be unsatisfied and possibly churn. Ideally each of these stages of the lifecycle for each of the key customer segments mentioned above should be handled by content marketing in some form. Zuora’s three doors concept is a good example of this value proposition delivered in a website. Content Types: Great content marketing strategy should leverage all of the available tools to maximize success. First teams should vary content types. For example in a blog writers should vary interviews lists how-tos personal interest stories. Each format provides a unique view into a space and a company’s position within it. Content marketing doesn’t stop at blogging and social media. Events are powerful tools for content marketing which blend a company’s voice with influencers’ voices and customer points of view. This social proof is a powerful force for sales. Look at most SaaS websites today’s including Looker’s and you’ll see the value proposition is quite often articulated by the company’s customers. Content in customer support canned responses in product messaging company communities and help pages are often forgotten places for content marketing efforts to shine and potentially retain customers at risk of churning. Mailchimp does this well. When a Mailchimp customer’s email list grows the Mailchimp team automatically sends an email congratulating the company on its success. Note the company never mentions the increase in cost to the customer instead focusing on the customer’s success. It’s ingenious. The most sophisticated content marketing strategies consider these three factors and the teams develop a content marketing calendar that creates a steady drumbeat of relevant material for each segment at each of the key stages in the lifecycle while varying the delivery mechanism. These three dimensions (segments lifecycle content type) can create quite a bit of complexity very quickly. Most startups tend to focus on one segment across a lifecycle for a few content types. As the content marketing team grows so does the complexity. But this framework provides one roadmap for how to start from a simple content marketing program and evolve into a complex but well orchestrated strategy. Published 2015-02-17,Published 2015-02-17
http://tomtunguz.com/adobe-saas-growth/,The SaaS Company that Grew from 0 to 4M Subscribers in 2.5 Years,The SaaS Company that Grew from 0 to 4M Subscribers in 2.5 Years In 2.5 years Adobe has transformed its business from a software license business into a SaaS business. It’s been a remarkable transition and one not talked about very much in the SaaS world. Transitions from licensed software to SaaS are rare. The travel and expense management behemoth Concur recently acquired by SAP for $8.3B is another great example that made the transition first from CD-ROM packaged software then to enterprise license software and then to SaaS. Above the line chart shows the astounding growth in the number of Adobe Creative Suite subscribers from the launch of CreativeSuite 6 in mid-2012 through March 2014 growing at 31% per quarter to 3.97M in their last quarter. Generating about $4B annually Adobe is worth $38B and employs more than 12500 people. And in 2012 the company decided to disrupt its own businesses. The licensed software business a cash cow generated more than $3.4B in revenue in 2011 at 97% gross margin. As the plot above shows the shift to SaaS was immediate in 2012. The company transitioned from packaged software to SaaS for Creative Suite 6 which Photoshop Illustrator Indesign Premier and other content creation software. Only 30 months after launch subscription revenues have outpaced license revenue at $2.1B and $1.6B respectively. The new SaaS business operates at 93% gross margins. As the number of subscribers has swelled Adobe has been able to maintain a relatively high average revenue per user (ARPU) of $451 per year or $37 per month in the last quarter. The figure has fallen from the initial price points of $530 dollars likely from volume discounts and greater penetration in education. The combination of subscriber growth and high ARPU has created a business that has grown from $0.1 to $1.8B in ARR in 11 quarters implying a 30% compound quarterly growth rate over those 33 months. Adobe’s transition to SaaS is enabled by the company’s dominant product line for creative professionals. However the transition hasn’t produced a meaningful increase in total revenue yet. As the chart above shows the Digital Media business the vast majority of which is CS6 has been flat to down for five years. Adobe’s future growth may lie more in it’s marketing software division which has doubled in the same time period and is itself a series of SaaS products. Nevertheless in just about 5 years Adobe’s transition from license software to SaaS will be complete and Adobe will have been one of the few SaaS companies to manage to disrupt itself successfully.

http://tomtunguz.com/interest-rates-and-startups/,The Impact of Interest Rates on Startup Fundraising,The Impact of Interest Rates on Startup Fundraising As Fred Wilson wrote over the weekend Janet Yellen the Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Fed) indicated last week that the Fed would likely increase the federal funds rate which has hovered around zero for the last seven years - since the collapse of Lehman. In the last 35 years the federal funds rate has varied from as high as 16% in 1981 to as low as 0.09%. throughout those cycles venture capital has flourished from a cottage industry into $100B per year asset class. VCs are on track to invest as much capital this year as during the height of the dot com era. But is there any observable relationship between the federal funds rate and the startup ecosystem? The chart above shows the federal funds rate starting in 2000 through 2015 compared to the dollars in billions of venture capital investment. From 2000 through 2009 the federal funds rate and venture investment paralleled each other. At the height of the bubble interest rates were relatively high. When the technology bubble crashed the Fed pursued a strategy of reducing interest rates in order to spur growth. Because venture capitalists viewed the environment is less rosy than before and limited partners also invested less in venture capital the amount of venture capital investment declined with rates. When the economy started to pick up steam again rates increased and so did venture capital investment. But since the start of quantitative easing the relationship no longer holds. Separately there’s no strong relationship between the Fed Funds rate and exits. See the chart for IPOs and M&A. As for the impact on valuations the plot above shows the average investment across all rounds over the same timeframe compared to the federal funds rate. It would be hard to draw any kind of relationship between these two trends. We do know however that the recent spike in average investment size is driven in large part by the growth of mega rounds and the influx of capital from nontraditional venture capitalists whose investments now account for about 40% of dollars. This non-traditional capital from mutual funds and hedge funds and other financial investors is the capital source most likely to be affected by short-to medium-term changes in interest rates. Unlike traditional VCs whose investors commit to 10 year funds for investment in startups nontraditional investors can invest across a broad range of different asset classes and can quickly decide to invest their dollars elsewhere. If these late stage investors were to leave the market growth multiples would likely contract as the supply of investment dollars would decline. But it’s impossible to say how long such a decline would take or predict the magnitude of such a change. The data indicates movements in the Fed Funds Rate aren’t predictive of startup investment. So changes in the fed funds rate aren’t likely to have an immediate impact on startups and their ability to fund raise. But at some point the fund raising market dynamics will change and the canary in the coalmine are the late stage investors whose dollars aren’t constrained to/focused on startups.

http://tomtunguz.com/five-characteristics-of-an-ideal-saas-company/,The Five Characteristics of An Ideal SaaS Company,The Five Characteristics of An Ideal SaaS Company With more than 80% of venture capital investments occurring in enterprise and with the public markets disproportionately rewarding SaaS companies with huge enterprise value-to-revenue multiples (median is 7.6) it’s no surprise that interest Software-as-a-Service is booming. After meeting quite a few SaaS companies I’ve compiled a list of my ideal characteristics for a SaaS business below. Characteristic 1: Product Is Core to the Operation of the Business The product is essential to the operation of a customer’s business. For example Zuora enables subscription billing; Expensify manages employee expenses; ZenDesk builds customer support systems. Customers can’t function without it. Characteristic 2: Cost/Value Proposition is Straightforward The product is either cheaper than the alternative: hiring an engineering team to build and maintain a custom implementation of the product; Or provides network effect benefits otherwise impossible to find: LinkedIn’s network effects drive the adoption of LinkedIn’s applicant tracking system; Or offers sophisticated technology that is difficult to replicate: Infer builds machine learning models on top of sales data to improve company performance. Not every company has ML expertise. Characteristic 3: Finances Its Own Growth The company benefits from negative working capital and shorter time-to-market. Negative working capital means customers pay at the beginning of a month or quarter or year to use the product. These customers pay to improve the software over time by providing cash up front reducing the cash needs of the business. Because customers are paying to improve the product rather than buying a “production-ready” enterprise product the company can go to market much earlier in their development. At the outset the company targets the less sophisticated SMB segment which doesn’t demand the compliance heavy security and integration features needed by enterprise customers. This also decreasing time to market and provides revenues and product feedback in the short term. Characteristic 4: Efficient Sales Model The company is able to recoup its cost of customer acquisition be it online marketing or inside/outside sales in less than a year. Ideally the company offers 12 month contracts and the company can be profitable on a customer before the customer has an option to churn. Hand-in-hand with this idea is strong customer retention. Characteristic 5: Market Leadership The company is already a market leader is on the path to becoming the market leader or is operating in a segment with little viable competition. In SaaS sales and marketing execution are critical to the success of the business. Competition increases customer acquisition costs and increases sales complexity. SaaS companies can be hugely valuable and for good reason: their products are core to their customers' businesses offer something which is unique in the market (cheaper better) finance their own growth through efficient sales models and ideally establish market leadership.

http://tomtunguz.com/time-to-utility/,Why You Should Be Measuring Time To Utility For Your Product,Why You Should Be Measuring Time To Utility For Your Product Do you measure your product’s time to utility? If not you should. The best products reward users as quickly as possible after installation and account creation. But it’s easy to forget about this and as a result watch conversion rates from download/install-to-active fall. CRM products have the longest time to utility of most software products. The end user a salesperson logs into a blank Salesforce installation. She must type in a bunch of data about a customer. If the customer account closes great. But it’s not until twelve or eighteen months later when the customer considers renewal and she has to strategize how best to pitch the customer that this salesperson benefits from any of the data entered into the CRM. On the other hand sales managers' time to utility for CRM products is much faster. As soon as the team enters in the current pipeline data he can see the sales forecast for the current month. This difference in time to utility is one of the causes of the tension in adopting CRM tools. It’s present in many enterprise tools that generate reports for management because there’s a time-to-value mismatch between the roles. Consumer products tend to offer faster time to utility: Google search Facebook news feed Twitter feed. Immediately after searching or logging in the user receives some value: the right results or some relevant updates. But if you think about the most frustrating software to use by and large the time to utility will be long and the magnitude of that utility will be small. Measure your time to utility for all your product’s segments and try to minimize it. You’ll see the impact at every step of the conversion funnel. Published 2013-06-04,Published 2013-06-04
http://tomtunguz.com/the-future-of-search/,The future of search,The future of search The Verge profiled Google Now Google’s newest search technology which uses “predictive” queries to show users the information they want to see before users ask. In a single app the company has combined its latest technologies: voice search that understands speech like a human brain knowledge of real-world entities a (somewhat creepy) understanding of who and where you are and most of all its expertise at ranking information. Google has taken all of that and turned it into an interesting and sometimes useful feature but if you look closely you can see that it’s more than just a feature it’s a beta test for the future. It’s quite a bold statement to make but I think it’s accurate. I believe Google Now will become the most salient differentiator of Android devices compared to other operating systems in the next 24 months. The product leverages Google’s investments in machine learning across all the disciplines above and carves a huge moat between Android and iOS (and Windows). I think Apple will continue to differentiate iOS using hardware design. Windows is leveraging its OS design differences. And Google will use search. In the video below Hugo Barra the head of product for Google Now asks for “directions to the museum with the William Paley exhibit” and Google Now returns navigation instructions to the De Young Museum reacting just like a person might. Examples of human-computer interaction like this one truly seem to be magic because they dissolve the barrier in communication between the two.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-limitless-opportunity/,Why We're Only Just at the Beginning of SaaS,Why We're Only Just at the Beginning of SaaS We may have been talking about SaaS companies for more than a decade but we’re still just at the beginning. The legacy software companies including Oracle Microsoft SAP and and IBM control 83% of the market cap of software businesses representing $830B in market cap. The largest SaaS company Salesforce is just about half the size of SAP and Microsoft is 8x bigger. In revenue terms the legacy vendors control an astounding 93% of revenue: $245B compared to $19B. While cloud software may not be able to wrest all the revenue from legacy players - there are after all some institutions where security remains paramount and cloud solutions just won’t fit the bill - SaaS startups have enormous opportunities before them. In addition some of the revenue of SAP and Microsoft and Oracle is SaaS revenue particularly as these business begin to acquire. SAP’s acquisition of Concur added $700M+ in annual SaaS revenue to their income statement. But by PWC’s estimates SaaS represents less than 10% of the legacy players’ revenue.

http://tomtunguz.com/forces-shaping-saas/,The Next Era in SaaS,The Next Era in SaaS Vik Singh wrote a great post in VentureBeat last week titled “Why Salesforce Needed to Buy RelateIQ” in which he talks about a new era in SaaS the Predictive Era the era of intelligent software. We’ve just seen one of the first acquisitions in the category with RelateIQ* but I believe we will see many many more for a few reasons. First and most importantly prediction provides competitive differentiation in an increasingly competitive market. It’s no longer sufficient in most horizontal SaaS categories to provide a cloud-based alternative with similar features to traditional software incumbents. RelateIQ showed this to some extent in CRM. The company uses natural language processing to reduce data entry. But this trend is as true for email marketing tools as logs analysis for calendars as lead prioritization tools. This differentiation is made possible because tens of thousands of customers already store the data required to feed machine learning algorithms in the cloud. As a result predictive SaaS companies can easily access this data. For example Vik’s company Infer* uses a customer’s Salesforce data among other data sets to predict which leads will convert to help sales teams prioritize their time. By prioritizing sales leads better Infer doubles the effectiveness of the sales team. Third machine learning is becoming an increasingly available skill set in the job market and the predictive ability of predictive models is improving. Last the costs to build models has plummeted as cloud infrastructure costs have fallen. Amazingly Amazon has reduced prices 42 times in the past few years. Predictive SaaS companies will face a few challenges as they go to market. First these companies must rise above the noise of the market. Many companies promise prediction and learning but few truly deliver it. This is key to winning customers at scale from incumbent players. Second predictive technologies work better with larger data sets. This typically means predictive SaaS companies should focus on mid-market/large customers and/or teams within businesses that generate large amounts of data. Last the company has to create a machine learning team. I’m really excited by the potential of prediction in SaaS. My partners and I at Redpoint have been actively investing in predictive SaaS and are proud to back RelateIQ Infer and Refresh among others. Particularly in the broad horizontal SaaS categories prediction will be one of the key differentiating factors for SaaS in the next five years.

http://tomtunguz.com/should-founders-join-incubators/,Should founders join incubators?,Should founders join incubators? Yesterday I spoke at Columbia Business School. We had a conversation about the role of incubators and accelerators (or the moniker of your choice) within the startup ecosystem. Given the volume of first time entrepreneurs and the broad growth of interest in entrepreneurship I think these programs are invaluable. To entrepreneurs these programs offer up to seven value propositions listed in order of importance as I see it. Education - Examples include General Assembly runs a substantial education program and YCombinator operates Startup School and First Growth’s Venture Network Startup-in-a-box - TechStars offers legal help to incorporate a company PR and marketing support for launch banking partners business development contacts developer tools discounts all with the goal of eliminating as much friction as possible and helping founders focus on product/market fit discovery and execution. Networking - Within each program founders develop relationships with like-minded entrepreneurs and most programs offer guest speakers typically luminaries and previously successful founders to speak about their startup experiences. 500Startups among others offers mentor networks. Fund raising assistance (aka Demo Day) - These events are designed to build auction pressure in financings by generating simultaneous investor interest. Ramen funds - Most programs offer between $10k to $150k in ramen money. It’s just enough to get someone started. Office space - Only a few incubators offer office space and many of them at a fee. General Assembly in New York and Founder’s Den in San Francisco are two great examples. Brand - Every graduate of an accelerator program can use the the brand of the program as proof of credibility. These incubators/accelerators are the graduate schools for entrepreneurship and have a very important role in the ecosystem. They may not be right for every company but these incubators build the hubs of successful entrepreneurship communities. And I hope they continue to thrive. Published 2012-09-26,Published 2012-09-26
http://tomtunguz.com/a-sixstep-framework-to-make-strategic-decisions/,A six-step framework to make strategic decisions,A six-step framework to make strategic decisions Any number of challenges can arise during a startup’s initial years. Some of these changes could be major and may require rethinking strategy. Competitors enter your target market. New products are released into your market which undercut yours. Customer acquisition costs rise dramatically. If faced with these questions it’s hard to know where to begin or how to structure an analysis to reach an answer. McKinsey uses a 6 step process to frame the process of answering these strategic questions which is profiled in this month’s Harvard Business Review. This framework has helped me many times simplify strategic questions and shift from questioning to analysis to action. Case: A new competitor emerges to compete with a startup Frame the strategic choices as mutually exclusive options. Start with the most apparent options. Either compete directly with a new competitor or change your target market. Generate alternatives. Brainstorm other possibilities that broaden the option set. Partner with the new entrant. Acquire the new entrant. Specify the conditions under which each option is attractive. Competing directly with a competitor makes sense only if our margins are better than our competitors and our cash balance is larger meaning we can spend more on marketing and customer acquisition. Identify barriers to each option. Our startup may lack the marketing competency to compete. Design and run tests to prove/disprove each of the conditions. Our goal is to quickly determine which options are feasible and realistic. Let’s run some initial marketing tests to gauge our return on investment. Let’s determine how long it would take to find the right marketing person and how much it might cost. Using the data make a decision. Enumerating the possibilities identifying key challenges developing the triggers for pursuing an option and then deriving key data to compare to these triggers builds clarity into the decision making process. By definition strategy is critical to companies. By using an analysis framework like the one above you can bring clarity and a common language with your board for evaluating and making the right strategic choices.

http://tomtunguz.com/great-products-turn-motivation-into-capability/,Great products turn motivation into capability,Great products turn motivation into capability Examining a user’s motivations at the entry point of every major feature in a product and matching the product to this motivation is key to building a great product users love. BJ Fogg’s Behavior Model Theory is a succinct summary of this idea in a formula: Motivation + Trigger + Ability = Behavior This model says that a user will perform a behavior when given the means the motive and the opportunity. The user brings motivation but it’s the responsibility of the product to trigger a behavior and offer an intuitive experience to complete it. Users' motivation varies. In ecommerce sometimes users are very motivated: I need to buy a last minute gift for my wedding anniversary. Sometimes users are lackadaisical: I’m just browsing. But the most effective products match a user’s changing motivation to the friction of the task. For example Amazon asks customers to fill out credit card information only after after adding items to a shopping cart. It’s one thing to do this in a single user flow like purchasing. But the very best products chain these behaviors together. They intake user motivation trigger and entice a user to perform behaviors over and over again deepening the user’s ability to use the product and driving engagement. Facebook is a great example. First Facebook asks you to create a profile of yourself online using vanity as a motivator. Then they ask you to visit the profile of your friends using curiosity as a motivator. Next they ask you to connect to your friends to increase your perceived popularity again using vanity. And so on with photos groups and applications. Integrating this philosophy into product development is a challenge but the results will speak for themselves. Published 2012-10-23,Published 2012-10-23
http://tomtunguz.com/ten-financial-metrics/,The 10 Most Important Metrics in a Startup's Financial Statements,The 10 Most Important Metrics in a Startup's Financial Statements Financial statements are a Rosetta Stone for startups. They reveal the strategies and the tactics of how to bring a product to market. These are the ten metrics I look at when sifting through a startup’s operational model whether when considering an investment or in a board meeting. Revenue growth indicates how quickly a company can grow under the current way of doing business. The top line shows whether the market affords steady growth (SaaS) or lumpy revenue growth created by the long sales cycles of big customers (Telecom) and whether the company must sell one product or a collection of complementary products. The revenue growth projections indicate the potential of the business. The Net Income aka bottom line or burn rate if negative is the revenue minus all the costs incurred. Net Income dictates the minimum amount a startup needs to raise to become profitable. By comparing Cash Net Income and Revenue I can calculate when a startup will need to raise its next round what its financial profile might be when it does go to market and get a sense of follow-on financing risk. Gross margin is a measure how expensive it is make the product. It’s calculated by taking the revenue and subtracting all the COGS (costs of goods sold) which in software businesses includes serving and hosting costs software licenses used and revenue share agreements in the case of ad networks. Most software businesses have gross margins of 80% or more which make them very attractive. On the other hand grocery stores operate at 30% gross margin. Gross margin is the glass ceiling of profitability because the net margin can never exceed the gross margin. Contribution margin measures profit per unit without considering fixed costs. To calculate contribution take the total revenue generated by selling one unit and subtract the variable costs to sell that unit. Selling and marketing costs tend to form the bulk of contribution margin costs in software companies. The greater the contribution margin the more profitable the business on a unit basis the more sales and marketing dollars can be spent to acquire customers and fuel growth. Contribution margins range from 5% to 25% depending on the sector. Of course contribution margin has to be put into context. The contribution margin of producing a kilowatt of energy from a fusion reactor might be nearly 99% but the fixed costs are measured in the billions. Contrast that with a 15% contribution margin ecommerce business which requires only $25M to become profitable. Which is more attractive? Customer acquisition payback period or sales efficiency is a gauge for how aggressive a company can be marketing and selling its services. The longer the payback period the greater the risk that a customer churns and the marketing dollars paid to acquire the customer are lost and vice versa. The most efficient businesses I’ve seen recover their customer acquisition cost in 6 months. A 12 month recovery window is more typical. In SaaS startups the payback period tends to be the driver for moving from monthly pricing to annualized contracts because it eliminates the profitability risk of a customer. Churn quantifies the revenue potential of each customer. A 3% monthly churn rate which is typical of public SaaS companies implies most customers will only hang around for 2 years. The greater the churn the more challenging revenue growth becomes over time. This often means a company will stimulate demand using paid acquisition decreasing contribution margin and impacting profitability. The single biggest expense for most startups is salary. By looking at salaries across functional areas I can get a sense for how a startup pays its employees relative to market rates. Low salaries could spell employee retention questions in the future. Excessive salaries reduce the company’s runway. I compare salaries to a set of benchmarks across venture backed companies as a litmus test. Sales quotas provide indications of how easily the product is sold and how well run the sales team is. Inside sales quotas vary from $150k to $600k per year and enterprise sales quotas vary from $1M to $2M depending on the product. At the early stages of a startup I tend to value consistency: smaller deal sizes but more predictable deal velocity (number of customers closed per week). Non-personel marketing spend is the most significant controllable expense in a business. It typically includes ad spending and event spending. This expense bucket can be turned on and off from month to month unlike salaries or rent. It’s important to me because it provides an indicator of how well understood the marketing process has become. For most startups I’ve seen demand generation budgets range from 5 to 20% of total expenses. The optimal ratio depends on the payback period. Revenue per employee. The beauty of software businesses is their leverage. Google’s market cap is 40% larger than Walmart but it has only 2% the size of Walmart’s employee count. Revenue per employee is a measure of how efficient a business is in using technology to bring their product to market. Some sectors and products intrinsically need more people to be sold.

http://tomtunguz.com/patience-unit-economics/,Startup Best Practices 13 - Patience with Unit Economics,Startup Best Practices 13 - Patience with Unit Economics Financial discipline is a hallmark of great companies. It’s what enables businesses to build exceptional go to market models weather difficult times and ultimately succeed. Sometimes financial discipline in startups is imposed by financial markets like in 2008 when the total amount of venture capital investment plummeted after Lehman imploded. Other times financial discipline is imposed by founders and management teams. The tweet above is from Lew Cirne founder and CEO of New Relic a $1.5B market cap company serving developers who deliberately raised small arounds at the outset of the company to impose financial discipline on his business. In other words Lew valued patience with unit economics. When it’s easy for startups to raise capital there is an easy way to solve most problems: hire more people. When the sales team needs more leads hire more marketers. When the engineering team has fallen a bit behind in the roadmap hire more developers. When the product team hasn’t designed the product well hire more customer success managers. This human capital Band-Aid strategy is expensive and won’t scale unless the company continuously raises large sums of money. Mark Roberge Chief Revenue Officer at Hubspot recently shared with me how he instill patience in unit economics in his teams. He has three go to market principles: Adopt before you buy - develop a bottoms up product that people can try out and ultimately upgrade themselves without having to contact sales or support Product before people - focus on improving the product before hiring additional customer support or salespeople. The product has to stand on its own. Individual before team - The initial product experience should focus on the individual or single player experience first and the broader team second. As Hubspot is a bottoms up business these principles makes sense. Focus on making sure the product is as efficient as possible moving potential customers through the funnel minimize human interaction in order to maximize margin. In addition Mark also has a best practice with the sales teams. After all it’s common practice to settle a reasonable quota for sales teams and simply add more reps to scale growth. In contrast Mark uses his sales teams’ performance to determine how quickly he grows the sales team. For example a startup employing Mark’s strategy might have a $4k MRR quota for its five person sales team. The VP of sales would then tell the existing sales team if they exceed $4.5k MRR quota next month there won’t be any incremental hires. And the quota then increase the next month to $5.0k and so on until the team can no longer meet the target. This strategy stretches the sales teams to become more and more efficient through better qualification sales process improvements feedback product and so on. Salespeople ought to be motivated to limit the size of the sales team to ensure each individual has access to the best leads. Given this constraint the sales team and the product team are aligned to figure out ways of scaling the sales process and developing better efficiencies than previously thought possible. Having the patience to develop compelling unit economics is one of the hardest things to do in a startup particularly in an environment where capital is cheap and problems can be solved simply by hiring. But this discipline enables companies to grow exceptionally quickly and capital efficiently in up markets and in down markets. It’s also a huge competitive advantage. Mark Roberge and Lew Cirne have created some exceptional examples to learn from. Published 2015-06-14,Published 2015-06-14
http://tomtunguz.com/three-most-important-trends-in-seed-market/,The Three Most Important Trends in the Seed Fund Raising Market,The Three Most Important Trends in the Seed Fund Raising Market If you’re a founder or potential founder and looking to raise seed capital you’re entering possibly the most attractive period in a decade to start a business. A few weeks agowe analyzed the impact of Series A and later stage VCs in the seed market. In the past four years traditional VCs began to invest in seed-stage companies which led to a rise in the number and size of seeds. But there’s another more important force within the seed market: institutional seed investors. Shai Goldman collected fund raising data on these institutional seed investors’ fund raising patterns and published it over the weekend. Looking through Shai’s terrific data I observed three trends. First as the chart above shows the amount of capital LPs are investing into institutional seed investors has grown by more than 3x in 4 years to about $3B in 2013. Six-months through 2014 another $3B has been invested. At this pace seed dollars may grow by 8x compared to 2011. Second median institutional seed fund sizes have increased by 66% to about $50M likely driven by the great acquisition environment. Larger seed funds mean more follow-on capital for second seed rounds and throughout the lifetime of the business. Third institutional seed funds’ share of total dollars raised has increased to about 20% of the total market through Q2 2014 which is an astounding figure. Just a few years ago it was 5%. This is likely driven by LPs the investors investing in VCs who seek more diversification and access to new fund managers who can offer great returns. Consequently there are about 150 new institutional seed funds created in the last few years. That means many more doors to knock on for founders and ultimately a greater likelihood of raising a seed round. All in all the seed market is one of the most fertile for founders in a long time. The amount of capital number of institutional seed investors and sizes of these funds imply an increase in the number of seeded companies and greater follow-on capital. Thanks again to Shai for aggregating this great data and shining a light into a booming part of the market. Published 2014-08-18,Published 2014-08-18
http://tomtunguz.com/b2c2b/,B2C2B Startups - Why Selling with Internal Influencers is so Powerful,B2C2B Startups - Why Selling with Internal Influencers is so Powerful This week an entrepreneur told me his startup is a B2C2B business. It was the first time I’d heard this acronym and I thought it was a genius moniker. B2C2B (business-to-consumer-to-business) succinctly captures the critical part of the new customer acquisition model powering many enterprise startups: winning hearts and minds of the intermediate consumer the employees of a company. B2C2B models are behind much of the innovation in every part of the enterprise stack from applications to platforms to infrastructure. In the application tier companies like Expensify and Tact use mobile app distribution to acquire end users (the C) in large enough quantities to eventually convert a team division or an entire enterprise into a paying customer (the B). In the platform tier Heroku and Pantheon market first to developers as end users (the C) who prefer to use dramatically simplified development environments to win them over as loyal users and proponents. Then Heroku and Pantheon sell through these developers into the enterprises they work for eventually closing larger enterprise license agreements. In the infrastructure tier Redhat Cloudera and MapR build momentum and distribution in the open source community to attract developers to use and deploy the software. Again they sell through these developers to close enterprise contracts. The power of the B2C2B model hinges on the influence of the C in a sales process. If a startup can convince either a large number of employees in a company to use a product or if they can convince a few of the right people that this is the right product for them that startup benefits in two ways. First the startup knows precisely which of their potential customers are primed to buy. Second the startup’s sales team has a powerful social proof argument to drive the sale through. Both of these advantanges result in faster sales processes with higher close rates enabling a business to grow more efficiently. It’s about time this bottoms-up sales model were more broadly recognized for the disruptive force that it is. In addition to all the financial success many of these companies enjoy perhaps the B2C2B acronym will further spread the gospel of influence driven marketing and sales in every part of the enterprise stack.

Naturally I put my data through its paces to see if I could find any best practices for this blog. Below are the conclusions which are tested to 95% confidence. I’ve also linked below to the code for recreating this analysis for your audience. Engagement rate defined by Twitter as clicks highlights and favorites of a tweet is relatively constant throughout the day. But impressions the total number of views of a particular Tweet spike right at the beginning of the workday from 8-11 and then at the end of the workday from 3-5. Not surprisingly retweets which drive impressions and reach are most common from 8-10 and from 4-5. Readers are most likely to click on an embedded link in the morning. 6am just as successful as 8-10am. Amazingly Twitter user behavior at least for my content has no statistically significant difference by day of week. The length of the tweet has no impact on engagement. The average tweet reaches at best 19% of my followers implying tweet recirculation is important. In summary the best time for me to tweet is between 8-10 am every day and then from 3-5pm. I’m going to change my Buffer schedule to reflect this data. I’m also going to recirculate Tweets more aggressively. For those seeking more detail I’ve posted the five most interesting charts from the analysis below. Bars in red are better than the bars in blue with 95% confidence. In case you’re curious to understand your own Twitter audience behavior the R code to replicate this analysis is found here. Published 2014-07-15,Published 2014-07-15

That chicken paillard looked sumptuous. Over the past few weeks I’ve been coding in Rails 3 quite a bit building a collection of tools to be more effective as a VC. And oddly enough I think back to Jacques Pepin quite often. The Jacques Pepin of the Rails world is Ryan Bates creator of RailsCasts. Watching Ryan’s shows I’ve learned how to build AJAX search deploy an identity management system and code beautiful charts in ten minutes each. There’s something intoxicating exciting and liberating about watching someone convince you of your capacity to perform a seemingly challenging feat whether cooking or coding by showing you how easy it is to do. It’s a testament to the power of video in teaching. Buttressing Bates' tutorials StackOverflow has become my essential tech support community. Paste an error message into Google and the first link is bound to contain a fellow coder’s struggles and eventual solution to the problem I’m now facing. The combination of tutorial expert video and support community is immensely powerful because it shares the expertise of a master with many while scaling the support and help needed by a mass audience. I believe this form of teaching will become ubiquitous for this reason. It’s already happening in coding with Railscasts and StackOverflow university education with 2U gaming with Machinima and many others. Jacques Pepin never did tell me how I botched that homemade mayonnaise. But there’s someone on the web who has watched the same episode made the same mistake and found a solution who might.

http://tomtunguz.com/culture/,The 3 Ways Culture Enables Startups to Scale,The 3 Ways Culture Enables Startups to Scale While culture may seem an ambiguous and fuzzy concept strong cultures are the best way for leaders to manage their companies throughout their evolution. One founder/CEO described his company’s rapid growth to several hundred employees in just a few years this way. First I was one of a few founders. As we grew I became a manager of people. Then a manager of managers. And now I’m a manager of managers of managers. At this scale CEOs can’t be in every room opining on each choice but they can influence how each decision in those rooms is made. As Jeff Bezos said in 2014 “My main job today: I work hard at helping to maintain the culture.” There’s no better known treatise on culture than Netflix’s Freedom and Responsibility deck. Like Netflix many companies publish their values. For example Google enumerates the 10 Things We Know to be True. Each of these items outlines the culture at the company which influences the company in three ways: hiring daily decisions vision/goals. For a culture to succeed the values hammered to the wall must accurately reflect the measures used to determine the employees hired promoted and let go. Culture influences hiring. First publicly posting the values of the company empowers candidates to see if the company’s values match their own. Second the interview questions and interview scoring criteria embodies the company’s key values and ascertain if the candidate is a good cultural fit. Googliness is the key attribute Google uses to evaluate cultural fit. Inside of companies with strong cultures new hires immediately sense whether they are at home and will stay or they are a fish out of water and should go. This reinforces the culture of the business. Culture influences daily decisions. Contrast Google’s notion “Fast is better than slow” with Apple’s “Don’t ship until it’s perfect.” Neither philosophy is superior to the other but they will attract different types of people. One encourages risks while the other champions craftmanship. Google’s culture works for the web where code pushes are immediate. Apple’s fosters better results in hardware where small mistakes can cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Each philosophy works to maximize the advantages of the company given their constraints. Culture influences the direction of the business. Leaders who create cultures that reward aggressive goal setting will find their teams rising to meet bold internal challenges. The SpaceX jobs page embodies this idea. Entitled “The Road to the Red Planet” it reads: SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars. and SpaceX is like Special Forces… we do the missions that others think are impossible. We have goals that are absurdly ambitious by any reasonable standard but we’re going to make them happen. Elon Musk’s ambition is stark and clear. I’m sure everyone who works at SpaceX understands exactly how Musk defines success. Great leaders manage through culture. It’s one of the great tools growing organizations can use to ensure the teams they build share the same values the company makes decisions in consistent ways and drive teams to achieve bold visions. Like strong magnetic fields culture can penetrate an organization to make sure everyone is pointed in the same direction. Published 2015-08-17,Published 2015-08-17
http://tomtunguz.com/onboarding-breakdowns/,A Rich Library of User Onboarding Analysis,A Rich Library of User Onboarding Analysis When I was at Google we worked with a user experience team frequently to help us design changes to the AdWords front end. After having reviewed our designs within our product team for weeks we often thought the design was complete and foolproof. But we were consistently proven wrong by the UX team whose work surfaced face-slapping oversights. At UserOnboarding Samuel Hulick has taken this approach with more than 40 different on-the-mark and a bit irreverent UX critiques of many top internet and mobile services. Reading through the breakdowns reminded me of those UX sessions at Google and reaffirms the insight a fresh pair of eyes can offer when looking at a product. Samuel’s critiques also surface the positive practices of products like Slack which provides concise descriptions of each step and clear calls to action. Great design is opinionated design on the right assumptions to make and while we all may disagree on the best affordances to make for users Samuel’s body of work provides one consistent view across many products to compare and contrast different approaches. Most importantly these breakdowns demonstrate the power of user experience research to catch the issues in product flow user communication and clarity that can materially impact user conversion rates through funnels. UserOnboard is a rich library of on-boarding approaches that should be in the library for product managers and designers everywhere. Published 2015-12-16,Published 2015-12-16
http://tomtunguz.com/timing/,A Formula For Innovation,A Formula For Innovation One of my favorite courses in engineering grad school was Marketing which was taught by a brilliant quirky professor. On the first day of class our professor wrote on the board this equation: Innovation = Invention + Marketing Addressing a group of engineers who prided themselves on their technical skills this professor of marketing tried to instill in us that invention alone isn’t enough to create innovation. The invention has to be coupled with a way of understanding the customer speaking to that customer educating the customer and ultimately convincing the customer to adopt the invention. Only when the customer base has adopted the invention at scale have we truly innovated. Aside from customer development the other the most important component of marketing is timing. Sometimes even the best inventions coupled with fantastic marketing still do achieve innovation. Because the market simply isn’t ready for them. It not infrequently in the Valley that you might hear “We built [insert successful company name here] three years before. We were just a little too early.” Timing the market is one of the most difficult things to do. Sometimes entrepreneurs fall into the right place at the right time with the right idea. Other times they might need a few years working within an industry for to understand the long-term trends of a customer or user base and the opportunities the industry affords. And then there are the exceptions entrepreneurs clearly have a knack for market timing. Elon Musk Jack Dorsey David Sacks are all repeat entrepreneurs who have had success in several industries. If I were to update the professor’s equation I would write: Innovation = Invention + Marketing + Timing Published 2013-06-17,Published 2013-06-17
http://tomtunguz.com/ecosystem-vs-competition/,Why the Petal Diagram Isn't the Best Competition Diagram for Startup's Pitch,Why the Petal Diagram Isn't the Best Competition Diagram for Startup's Pitch Steven Blank wrote yesterday about a novel way of depicting a startup’s competitive landscape in a pitch deck called a petal diagram. While the petal diagram is a great way of describing an ecosystem or a go-to-market strategy I don’t think it’s a great way to show a competitive landscape because petal diagrams don’t communicate the startup’s unique way of competing in the market. The ideal competition slide accomplishes at least one but up to four goals. First the competition slide communicates the startup’s worldview of their ecosystem relays the key axes of differentiation in the market and summarizes the startup’s advantages. Second the competition slide demarcates the other key players in the ecosystem established and emerging and how each of them fit within the worldview. Third the slide conveys the dynamics within the ecosystem: who is partnered with whom; which incumbents are looking to partner/acquire vs go it alone etc. Fourth the competition slide should shows the current market opportunity and if needed adjacent market opportunities that justify a venture scale outcome. The petal diagram can effectively communicate the players in the ecosystem and describe how a startup will engage with an ecosystem through customer acquisition channels. In the fictitious Rocket Startup example above the petal diagram shows all the different customers segments the Rocket might pursue which could be filled with customers logos and the sales mechanisms the company might use to acquire those customers. But a petal diagram is a very difficult format to convey Rocket’s differentiation in the market required to win share. I’m not sure how to do it. Tweet me if you have ideas. Even for a company in a new segment like internet of things or drones it’s unclear how to express differentiation with the petal diagram. There’s a reason the 2x2 matrix is cliche - it works for well understood industries where the size and segments of the market are understood and the typical disruptive innovation is a price/performance breakthrough like this one for Pure Storage. Another alternative is a pyramid which expresses a startups intent to disrupt a market by addressing a new segment as in this example for Expensify. Value chains can also be used to express disruption by vertical integration or disintermediation. In this case the diagram highlights Electric Imp’s vertical integration in the connected devices world. There are many ways to create a competition slide. No matter the format the structure of the slide has to reinforce and support the main message which in the case of competition slides is why the startup is best positioned to win disproportionate share. The petal diagram is a useful tool for depicting go-to-market and ecosystem slides where channels and partners are important but because of the difficulty in expressing differentiation I wonder about its effectiveness as a competitive overview format.

The chart above plots the time required for startups to raise rounds at $1B or greater valuation over the past ten years. The blue line is a logarithmic regression demonstrating the decrease from about 7.5 years to less than 2.5 years. The answer seems to be an unequivocal yes. Let’s break this chart down by type of company: B2B and B2C. B2B companies have taken longer to reach this valuation milestones. 10 years for Docusign. 5 for Pure Storage. But only 3 years for HortonWorks. B2C companies grow much faster than B2B companies and the data proves the trend. Social networks in particular see faster and faster rates of adoption: Facebook Tumblr Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Instagram Snapchat have reached the $1B mark faster than the other almost in lock step with their year of founding. Why is this happening? I think there are at least four causes. First and most importantly sample bias. We haven’t yet allowed enough years for the companies founded in 2011 that require five years to reach a billion dollar value to mature which depresses the average value. The startup founded in 2010 that takes 7 years to reach the $1B mark hasn’t yet been granted enough time to achieve it. In addition some companies never reach the billion dollar valuation mark in the private markets preferring to go public beforehand. ZenDesk and New Relic are two recent examples. But for the companies on this list distribution platforms enable companies to scale much more quickly than ever before. iOS and Google Play address billions of users. A hit application or social network that captures the minds of users can achieve much faster growth rates than their web-based predecessors and address the 10x greater population of mobile phone users compared to PC users. Enterprise platforms like Salesforce’s Force.com gave rise to Veeva a company that raised only $4M before going public seven years after founding now worth billions. Third users are much more receptive to trying new technologies than ever before. Consumers trust mobile commerce. Enterprises pursue technology innovations and adopt them at earlier phases of product development to gain a competitive advantage. Many of the biggest banks in the world have staffed technology business development teams to scout and source breakthrough technologies. In addition open source software is a big driver of infrastructure innovation. Open source provides transparency and prevents lock-in to proprietary standards for large companies. More importantly open source is a powerful distribution mechanism. Look no further than the containerization movement pioneered by Docker and now CoreOS whose growth is enabled by Open Source to prove the point. Last the capital to finance immense growth is readily available. Startups are raising rounds that would only have been possible in the public markets five to ten years earlier. The median IPO in the late 90s was about $25-30M. Today that’s a big Series A. In the current environment a large growth round can top $250M. 2014 will likely be the third largest year for VC fund raising since 2000 meaning investors have more capital to invest than in quite a while. In the meantime the number of billion dollar startups has increased but not quickly enough to keep pace with the increase in capital. This supply demand imbalance is also leading to an increase in startup prices further decreasing the time to $1 billion in valuation. Some startups are growing faster than ever before. These breakout companies’ market value increases dramatically through their lifecycle and they are empowered to grow faster and faster by new distribution platforms and a capital market that is hungry to fuel their growth.

http://tomtunguz.com/how-to-price-your-startups-product/,The 7 Factors to Consider When Pricing Your Startup's Product,The 7 Factors to Consider When Pricing Your Startup's Product Most startups play defense when discussing pricing with customers. They dance between asking for too little leaving money on the table and asking for too much only to lose the customer’s interest. The very best companies lead their customers in that dance. They use pricing as an offensive tool to reinforce their product’s value and underscore the company’s core marketing message. For many founding teams pricing is one of the most difficult and complex decisions for the business. Startups operate in newer markets where pricing standards haven’t been set. In addition these new markets evolve very quickly and consequently so must pricing. But throughout this turmoil startups must adopt a process to craft a good pricing strategy and re-evaluate prices periodically but at least once per year. These are the seven factors I believe founders should consider when pricing when they go to market: The Basis for Pricing: There are three ways to justify a pricing plan. Value-based pricing charges customers a fraction of the incremental value created by the product or a fraction of the costs saved by the product. This is often seen in ad tech or any type of optimization technology. A startup increases conversions by 50% and they take 10% of the gain as their fee. Value based pricing is also employed in slightly less rigorous ways. Salesforce sells CRM seats based on an aggregate ROI of increased sales productivity for example. So does Expensify which decreases the time to file expenses. With cost-based pricing startups mark up the product they sell by some margin. Many infrastructure as a service companies do this. AWS Twilio Heroku etc. It’s very common in commodity or nearly-commodity industries where customers know the prices of the components used to provide the service. Third competition based pricing works well in markets where the price and value of a particular type of product are well established. Startups adopt the pricing model well known in the industry. Positioning: Positioning is the most frequently forgotten of the 4 Ps in Marketing. Salesforce exemplifies exceptional positioning. Used strategically pricing can be a weapon a source of competitive advantage in the market. Your company can employ pricing to communicate to the market whether your product is a premium mid-market or low cost alternative. Startups can choose to price below the market to gain share and grow quickly (Zendesk AirWatch); they can choose to price at the market price and differentiate based on product features (Dropbox and Box) ; or they can charge a premium for their product which reinforces their positioning as the gold-standard in the sector (Palantir and Workday). To be effective a startup’s pricing strategy must align with its marketing case studies website messaging PR releases and sales pitches. If all the arrows point in the same direction then pricing becomes an asset to reinforce the company’s position in the market. Customer Base Size: The number of total potential customers multiplied by the selling price of the product equals the total addressable market (TAM) for a startup. Generally speaking bigger TAMs are better. If there are a small number of relevant customers as in Veeva’s case where the entire market is about 200 pharmaceutical companies the average revenue per customer must be very high. At IPO Veeva’s average customer paid the company about $750k per year. On the other hand if there are millions of potential customers as in Expensify’s case the average revenue per company can be much smaller and still justify a billion-dollar-plus TAM. Sales Team Structure: Pricing impacts the structure of a sales team and their day to day performance for two reasons. Higher price points decrease sales velocity the number of deals closed per sales rep per unit time and increase sales volatility the chances a deal closes. Inside sales teams selling $5-30K products can sustain a deal velocity of 3-8 transactions per month depending on quota. This keeps morale high and creates a very predictable revenue forecast. No individual customer signing or balking will materially alter the company’s ability to achieve plan. On the other hand higher price points require more skilled more expensive salespeople. Called field sales or outside sales people their compensation starts at about $250k per year for on-target earnings (OTE - combination of salary and sales commission). Outside sales teams chase larger accounts and may close 1-3 per year. But if all of them go sideways the company’s revenues for the year will suffer materially. Contract Length: Many SaaS startups launch with monthly pricing which encourages customers to try the product and engenders demand. At some point most SaaS startups switch to annual contracts for three reasons. First revenue becomes much more predictable. Second annual contracts often include terms that require pre-payment up-front which rewards the startup with lots of cash to grow faster. Third contracts mitigate churn rates because the customer is only making a renewal decision once per year instead of 12x per year. Employing contracts can materially improve a startup’s cash position unit economics and predictability. Your Startup’s Unit Economics: Your pricing plan has to enable the company to become profitable at some point. The value of your business is the discounted sum of all its future profits. Adopting a lower price point may increase sales velocity create lots of demand and keep sales teams happy but if the price point doesn’t generate enough gross margin to achieve reasonably quick payback periods and the business suffers from an increase in churn the company is in trouble. Just a quick reminder: Payback Period = Cost of Customer Acquisition/Gross Margin The gross margin is the revenue per customer minus the costs to provide the service. A decrease in price reduces gross margin and will consequently increase payback period. Margin Structure of the Customer Base: Compared to software companies grocery stores are terrible customers because grocery stores have single digit margins. The margin structure of your startup’s customers matters a great deal when setting pricing. All of your product’s cost must be paid from your customers margin. The more margin your customer has the more they can pay you for your product. Like product development developing pricing is a never-ending exercise. A startup’s environment its product and its positioning change with time and price must evolve in tandem. The best way for a startup to ensure its price is reasonably optimal to create a framework for evaluating price and revisit the data a few times per year. This is one framework. If you have others or additions email me. I’d love to hear them. To end this conversation on pricing I’ll quote Lawrence Steinmetz who wrote a book on sales called How to Sell at Margins Higher Than Your Competitors: “The first thing you have to understand is the selling price is a function of your ability to sell and nothing else. What’s the difference between an $8000 Rolex and a $40 Seiko watch? The Seiko is a better time piece. It’s far more accurate. The difference is your ability to sell.” Sales marketing product and pricing when aligned create powerful branding and margin-expansion effects. Published 2014-11-05,Published 2014-11-05
http://tomtunguz.com/the-typical-billion-dollar-startup-acquisition/,The Typical Billion Dollar Startup Acquisition,The Typical Billion Dollar Startup Acquisition When startups are acquired there are many considerations in accepting an offer. Does the vision of the acquirer fit the startup? Will the startup operate independently or be integrated? What is the price and structure of the transaction? Most of these questions have to be answered through extensive conversations with suitors. As for the structure of the acquisition there’s data that can be used for benchmarking. I’ve assembled about 2400 M&A events of venture-backed technology companies since 2000 to compare the fraction of the total consideration which is stock and cash. There are two trends in the data: how the cash/stock split changes over time and how the split changes with the size of the outcome. The first chart below shows the trends by size. The x-axis shows the Acquisition Value in $M and the y-axis shows the cash share. Each circle is one transaction. Three conclusions are evident from the chart. First 83% of these acquisitions were cash only. Only 1.5% of transactions were consummated with less than 10% of the value in cash. Second the larger the transaction the more likely stock will play a significant role. The table below shows the trend of the average cash split falling from 92% to 57% for the very largest M&A. Third a power law governs acquisitions. 50% of transactions had values of $50M or less; 64% of transactions were for less than $100M. Exit Price in $M Average Cash Split in % Count 50 92 1181 100 91 354 200 90 304 500 90 296 1000 88 123 2000 91 64 5000 93 56 10000 79 17 15000 57 2 The second chart below is a boxplot of the cash share of the acquisition. The red box represents the 25 to 75% quartiles and each black point is an outlier (greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean). In the dot-com boom when stock was cheap and plentiful many acquisitions had considerable stock components. Over time however as the technology companies’ balance sheets have become cash rich the trend has progressed from 77% cash to 94% cash in 13 years. Perhaps as SaaS valuations continue their stratospheric rise and stock becomes cheap incumbents acquihire startups or bolster their product offerings with add-on acquisitions the stock/cash split may revert more to the mean. But today cash is king. Published 2013-12-09,Published 2013-12-09
http://tomtunguz.com/seed-follow-ons/,The Seed Investment Patterns of Billion Dollar Startups,The Seed Investment Patterns of Billion Dollar Startups Over the past few years there has been a pronounced shift in the seed market. VCs now participate quite actively in the market. As a result seed investment volumes have roughly doubled in the past year. But is the seed strategy working for startups and VCs? Do hugely successful businesses raise seed capital? Do those businesses include VCs in their seed rounds? And most importantly do the VCs follow on in the Series A? To find the answer I tabulated the early financing history for about 30 companies with $500M+ valuations (either private or public) founded in the past 8 years and sourced data from CapitalIQ and Crunchbase. What fraction of startups with recent billion dollar valuations or thereabouts raised a seed round? About 55%. What fraction of those seed rounds saw VC participation? 71%. In what share of cases did VCs in the seed round lead the Series A? 67%. To fully understand whether theses seed strategies work we would need perfect information on total dollars invested in seed the returns of those dollars the cost of servicing the seed portfolio and opportunity cost of exploring investment elsewhere. But on the whole investing in seeds seems to pay off handsomely for VCs particularly if the seed investing program lands a big winner. Additionally the seed investment does lead to a high follow on rate though to get a better sense we would need to compare this metric to the follow on rate of less successful startups. Other interesting data points from the analysis. On average and of those billion dollar startups who raised a seed or A the average seed round was $1M and the average Series A was $7.7M.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-seasonality/,The Importance of Seasonality in SaaS Startups,The Importance of Seasonality in SaaS Startups For Google seasonality is an important factor in forecasting quarterly revenue growth. In the advertising business Q4 is always the strongest followed by Q1. Q2 is the weakest. In Google’s latest financial year the difference between the weakest and strongest quarters was 22%: $14.4B in Q4 and $11.8B in Q2. I wondered if the same were true for SaaS companies. Should SaaS startup forecasts account for differences in underlying customer purchasing habits? While not subject to the consumer buying holiday cycle like advertising based companies SaaS salespeople might be impacted by the vacation schedules of their customers or some other factors I couldn’t anticipate. But the data show seasonality is largely irrelevant to SaaS companies even the very largest ones. Below I’ve charted the quarterly revenue growth patterns of the 40 or so publicly traded SaaS companies. I’ve indexed revenue growth to Q1 meaning a Q2 value of 200% implies a Q2 that is twice as large in revenue as Q1 and so on for each subsequent quarter. While there are outliers whose Q4s are the worst performing quarters (Ariba BazaarVoice E2Open and Concur) the vast majority of public SaaS companies grow through the year unfazed by the summer doldrums of Q3 and the holiday slowdown in Q4. Below is a table with the average revenue by quarter indexed to Q1. Across all public SaaS companies Q4 is on average about 28% larger than Q1. Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Revenue Indexed to Q1 1.00 1.05 1.11 1.28 I suspect some of the strength in Q4 might be budget liquidation. Before year end VPs may find excess funds and seeking to maintain their budget size for next year stuff additional SaaS products into their budgets. But otherwise revenue seems to grow at a fairly consistent pace. This table makes plain one of the benefits of the recurring revenue model: predictability. The linearity of revenue growth across sectors and ages of companies implies SaaS companies aren’t subject to the same seasonality forces of other segments and sectors.

http://tomtunguz.com/startup-growth-rate-all-time-high/,Why Startups Are Growing Faster Today than Ever Before,Why Startups Are Growing Faster Today than Ever Before Startups today are growing faster than they have in the past. US VC backed startups in 1998 grew revenue 63% per year on average. In 2014 the median startup grew at 85% CAGR before going public. More impressively newer startups must be 5x larger than 15 years ago before going public. In 1998 the median IPO-bound startup reported $11.8M in revenue in their S-1 (inflation adjusted dollars). In 2014 a startup needed $54M. Withthe two venture backed IPOs though August 1 2015 the trend shows no signs of abatement. These increasing growth rates are fueled by three key trends. First the acquisition channels startups use to acquire customers address many more potential customers and enable far more cost effective marketing than twenty years ago. Second purchasers of products both consumers and enterprises are much more inclined to purchase products from startups than ever before. Third the private market investors are willing to invest in high-growth startups despite the greater losses sustained during most rapid growth. It’s not uncommon to hear startup marketing departments speak of acquiring customers on Facebook for a few dollars. But equally importantly these marketing teams can acquire tens if not hundreds of millions of users before exhausting the acquisition channel. And in addition to Facebook there’s LinkedIn mobile app stores enterprise app stores content marketing and a host of other customer acquisition techniques not employed 20 years ago. This quiver of options means the limiting factor for marketing teams often is cash. Because buyers are increasingly predisposed to try new products the unit economics of these campaigns often work well and so it’s a question of spending more to make more. Also subscription revenue models have become broadly adopted in enterprise and some consumer segments which provides revenue predictability. So a startup can invest a lot of money today to generate 3x or 5x as much revenue over the customer lifetime in the next few years. In such cases cash is the main limitation. Fortunately VCs are investing at potentially unprecedented rates providing startups the cash needed to acquire as many customers as possible even if the profitability suffers. Because many industries operate with winner-take-most dynamics the startup that grows the fastest will raise the biggest round will be able to grow faster and consequently will be able to raise more money at a higher valuation than its competitors. If the unit economics of this game are sound then this is a terrific bull market business strategy. If on the other hand the unit economics have yet to be proven it’s a game of chicken among the competitors. How deep in the red are you willing to go to achieve best in class growth rates? As a consequence of these three trends startups are able to grow faster than ever before. And we are seeing new records set each year. The fastest social network to 100M users the fastest software company to $50M in annual recurring revenue etc. We also see some companies burning through hundreds of millions of dollars only to shutter. That’s the double edged sword of fast money. Published 2015-08-07,Published 2015-08-07
http://tomtunguz.com/kitkats-best-feature/,The Most Important Feature In KitKat No One is Talking About,The Most Important Feature In KitKat No One is Talking About Quietly mentioned in yesterday’s press conference about Google’s Android update is a new feature that will change the way people use their mobile phones search deep-linking. With KitKat Google is applying its world-class crawling and search technology to the content and data within mobile applications. Quoting from the Verge >A search for a restaurant will offer a link directly to that restaurant page in the OpenTable app if you have it installed allowing you to set up a reservation. Or a recipe search will bring you to the result directly inside of the AllRecipes app — rather than the mediocre mobile website. This seemingly small feature called deep-linking will change the way users interact with their mobile phones. To date mobile app content has been siloed behind rectangular chiclets. Looking for a document? Can’t remember if it’s stored in Evernote Box Gmail or Dropbox? Today finding it means loading each application and performing search within the four applications. In the next few months you’ll be able to type in a few keywords in Google search discover the document you’re looking for is in Gmail and with one click be taken to that email in the Gmail app. In addition to creating a much better user experience deep-linking enables five important secular trends in mobile: First mobile application developers will use mobile search engine optimization to re-engage users. With search deep-linking content within applications will be surfaced in search results driving users back with greater frequency. This is critical because today the only tools available to mobile application developers to draw users back to their applications are push lifecycle marketing tools email and push notifications. Search is a user action a pull laden with intent. Second mobile commerce will boom. Google’s technology will send users deep within mobile applications instead of the degraded mobile web experiences whose high friction payment experiences cause users to abandon their carts. Because applications store identity and payment credentials these apps enable 1-click payments and will user conversion rates substantially. Third new advertising opportunities will be created for developers. I suspect Google will enable bidding for premium position in the search results. Imagine a user with two different travel booking applications eg. Kayak and Orbitz. When the user initiates a search on Google for flight each of these mobile applications would likely be willing to bid on premium placement to capture the transaction. Fourth search deep-linking solidifies Google search as the default first action for every user on android. Like on the web search will provide the fastest means of accessing content on a mobile phone. Fifth search deep-linking will re-inforce native application dominance. The better UX afforded by native apps and the easier payment flows will finally be accessible to the billion Android users and their tens of billions of monthly search queries. Given the volume of Google searches on mobile phones and the fountain of traffic Google mobile searches present I expect developers will go to great lengths to integrate with Google’s search deep-linking and for them to be handsomely rewarded. Deep-linking despite its small and unnoticed entry heralds a new era for mobile apps. Published 2013-11-01,Published 2013-11-01
http://tomtunguz.com/hacking-performance-reviews/,Hacking the Performance Evaluation,Hacking the Performance Evaluation Performance reviews tax organizations managers and employees to such an extent that some companies have abolished them outright. Reviews are emotionally complex conversations. Positive and negative feedback are intertwined with conversations about career progression raises and equity grants. These meetings are emotional powder kegs; and it’s no wonder they stress us. In Work Rules Google’s Chief People Officer Laszlo Bock argues for a different type of performance review: a split review. At Google “annual reviews happen in November and pay discussions happen a month later.” There’s a theory underpinning this decision. We motivate ourselves by internal and external factors. The satisfaction of improving a skill is internal. A cash bonus is external. Self-improvement elicits better performance than compensation but both motivators work. The problem though is when they are conflated. Research shows that external motivators can easily trump internal ones. In a review it’s easy to focus on the compensation elements to the detriment of the personal growth feedback. So most reviews end up being about compensation rather than self-development. To quote Pasad Setty another Googler in the People Ops team: “Traditional performance management systems make a big mistake. They combine two things that should be completely separate: performance evaluation and people development. Evaluation is necessary to distribute finite resources like salary increases or bonus dollars. Development is just as necessary so people grow and improve.” I haven’t experienced a split performance review but I hope to. The idea makes sense to me and I suspect that having two conversations one about internal motivators and one about external motivators would have helped me focus more on personal development. Plus splitting the conversations into a personal development conversation and a compensation conversation deflates a lot of the emotional tension and stress of the current way most companies do reviews. Would you prefer a split review? Published 2015-04-13,Published 2015-04-13
http://tomtunguz.com/saas-office-hours-pete-koomen-notes/,4 Lessons For SaaS Startups From Optimizely's Early Days,4 Lessons For SaaS Startups From Optimizely's Early Days Last night SaaS Office Hours hosted Optimizely co-founder and CTO Pete Koomen. Pete was a Google Associate Product Manager for AdSense and launched Google App Engine. Then he joined his co-founder Dan Siroker also an APM at Google to found three companies the last of which is Optimizely. As Pete shared with us the idea of Optimizely was borne from a need Dan saw when managing the teams to build Obama’s fundraising websites during his first campaign. Dan and his team wrote code to fine-tune sign-up flows and the experiments meaningfully improved fundraising performance. During YCombinator after Pete and Dan had been accepted with a different ecommerce idea that the two founders jettisoned the first idea and instead pursued the website optimization concept. Famously they tested the idea by calling two advertising agencies and asking them to pay $1000 a month for early access to a product that didn’t yet exist (but soon would). Now 400 people strong Optimizely is the leader in A/B Testing. The conversation at the Redpoint office in San Francisco last night focused on the insights Pete accumulated during the early days of the company. These were some of the things I learned from Pete. First hire a management coach to work with you as the company grows. As Optimizely evolved the demands on Dan and Pete increased enormously. Pete told us that being a leader is a never-ending journey of improvement. The best ways he found to learn leadership skills was to hire a management coach to meet him once per month to talk through the issues facing him at Optimizely. In addition the management coach performed 360 degree reviews for Pete to help him understand how his team wanted him to evolve to maximize his impact on the company. Second you must fire yourself way before you think you do. As soon as you become good at a job - sales product marketing - you know enough to hire the person to replace you. And you should do it right then. It’s the only way to scale the business. When that person starts you have to stand back and let the new employee learn the job making the mistakes they need to make to become great at it. As a founder of a business Pete told us that’s an incredibly hard exercise in letting go. Third hire for hustle in sales especially at the beginning of the company when the sales process and sales motions aren’t defined. Optimizely’s first successful salesperson had previously started a mattress-recycling company in Seattle. Optimizely’s second salesperson had retired from professional ballet-dancing. Though these two key contributors possessed atypical sales backgrounds they shared a fire a determination that fueled their success in discovering the right go-to-market strategy for the company. Last after your startup finds product market fit hiring becomes the top priority of the business. Pete said - and I loved this expression - “You have to build the machine that will build the machine.” In early 2012 Dan and Pete gathered the company at the beginning of the year to say that 2012 would be the year of hiring and that everyone’s first priority is building a great team. Pete asked every employee to share their likes and dislikes of working at Optimizely and used that to enumerate the companies values which became the rubric that measured candidates and determined which would become Optinauts - Optimizely employees. Pete is an inspirational leader who is remarkably genuine about the successes and struggles of building a category defining company. Thank you Pete for sharing some of these insights and stories!

http://tomtunguz.com/2015-software-exit-market-in-review/,2015 Software Startup IPOs and M&A - What Does the Data Imply for 2016?,2015 Software Startup IPOs and M&A - What Does the Data Imply for 2016? In the last 22 months there have been 4 $1B+ software IPOs and 3 $1B+ software acquisitions. But compared to 2014 2015 was a meager year for startups looking to go public or be acquired. The chart above plots the M&A activity over this period. The M&A market halved in activity. In 2014 $11B of disclosed M&A occurred. I’m excluding take-private transactions of public companies like SAP/Concur Bain/BlueCoat Oracle/Responsys etc. Through November 1st 2015 transaction values dipped 40% to $6.8B. The number of transactions has also nearly half from 38 to 17. However in 2015 the median acquisition was worth $410M compared to $193M in 2014 indicating that buyers are not buying as frequently but when they are they spend more. In 2015 the IPO Market stalled. 13 software companies went public last year raising $1.6B an average of $105M per company. So far in 2015 only Xactly has gone public raising $56M. Looking at the data in another way at the beginning of 2014 the enterprise value of all publicly traded SaaS companies totaled $151B. As of Friday that same basket of companies is worth $176B. And all the companies that have gone public in the last 23 months are worth $13.7B or about 7.7%. During the same period forward revenue multiples the primary metric used in public markets to value software companies has fallen from 8.1x to 5.3x. Why was the exit activity in 2015 starkly different than 2014? It’s not that the quality software companies has declined nor have growth rates of software startups dwindled. Rather startups are finding the private financing markets far more attractive than the public ones. In the private markets software companies can raise capital at 10 to 15x forward revenues a premium of 200% over the public markets. The difference in public and private valuations is only exacerbated by huge increase in the growth capital markets pushing private valuations up and the downward pressure on multiples facing publicly traded software companies. These opposing force have increased the relative prices of software startups undoubtedly contributing to the substantial decline in acquisition activity. What does this mean for 2016? I suspect a major trend is the private markets will slowly come back into line with the public markets paying similar forward multiples for companies. This will catalyze a wave of acquisition because for the last 18 months or so the opposing forces of increasing private valuations and decreasing public valuations have made start up acquisitions substantially more expensive. In the next 18 months the converse will be true and cash-rich acquirers who have been looking to bolster their product lines and develop new areas for growth will perceive startups as far more attractive acquisitions at more reasonable prices. And the IPO market will reward those companies with exceptional growth and relatively modest burn rates. Growth rate is still the number one correlating factor to forward multiple for software companies anti-correlation has increased over the last two quarters from 0.3 to 0.43 indicating public market investors are just as hungry for growth as ever with one caveat. A path to short term profitability will be much more important in 2016 than before. I do want to note that the public markets have been very receptive to SaaS companies. In the same period the median SaaS IPO has increased 17% from its IPO price and is on average above 35% from its last round post-money valuation. And with the number of superfast growing capital efficient software companies in the private market I expect 2016 to be healthy year for software IPOs and exits - much better than 2015.

http://tomtunguz.com/customer-success/,How to Hire a Head of Customer Success for Your Startup,How to Hire a Head of Customer Success for Your Startup Credit: National Geographic I was lucky enough to spend some time with Monica Adractas a former McKinsey partner who is now Churn Czar at Box. She and I chatted about the challenges in managing churn and her view on how to handle it. I thought she had some terrific insights and a clear understanding of the methods to reduce churn from her experiences. These are my notes from that conversation: Managing churn is a complicated problem because everyone in the company can impact it. The product and engineering teams must build a product that meets customer needs. Sales must find and close the right kinds of customers. Support must educate inform and cross-sell customers properly and marketing must price and message the product effectively. If any one of these teams makes a misstep churn rises. To materially reduce churn the company must appoint someone who has the data access and the mandate within the organization to search for and identify causes of churn and the influence to enact change. This person is often the first cross-functional hire for a startup the first person whose job is exclusively to work with all the different teams. Often this person is called the head of customer success. Initially the head of customer success is charged with churn mitigation i.e. retaining customers for longer periods of time. But over time the customer success role evolves to maximizing lifetime-value of a customer. The difference between the two is the addition of cross-sell/up-sell selling more of the same product or selling adjacent products to increase the revenue per customer. This transition is of course contingent upon the company building additional products and features that can command additional revenue in the market. The key initial steps for the head of customer success are: First to instrument the company to understand customer pathways points of interaction and the customer perception of the company’s value proposition. Second to analyze and develop a system-level understanding of the state of churn. Third champion and effect change in each of the relevant functional groups to reduce churn. By having one person own the churn number figure and prosecute the tactics to reduce it the head of customer success can materially change the financial profile of the company. – Monica’s view of her role at Box provided me with a really clear understanding of how the head of customer success ought to pursue their role and also the right background for a person to succeed in this role: empathy for customers data-driven decision making systems thinking and an ability to coordinate many different decision makers in an organization.

http://tomtunguz.com/challenger-sales-process/,Challenging Your Customers During Your SaaS Startup's Sales Process,Challenging Your Customers During Your SaaS Startup's Sales Process In 2009 the Corporate Executive Board a consultancy providing expertise to some of the world’s largest companies studied the distinguishing characteristics of great sales people and well-run sales processes. They surveyed more than 6000 sales reps across 90+ businesses. The analysis revealed three interesting things. First most customers don’t perceive a difference between competitive products. Over and over we found that customers generally speaking see significantly less difference between us and the competition than we do ourselves. It’s not that they think most suppliers are particularly bad on brand product or service. It’s just that [customers] don’t think [suppliers are] particularly different. Second the most important factor in a purchasing decision is internal consensus that a vendor is the right one for the job. Salespeople must engender solidarity among the group that will report their findings to the ultimate decision-maker. Third given those two hurdles what types of sales people and sales process work best and most consistently across industries and products? The CEB’s analysis found five types of sales people one of which one stood out: the Challenger. The CEB clustered salespeople into Challengers Lone Wolves Hard Workers Problem Solvers and Relationship builders. The figure above shows Challenger reps represent 23% of the surveyed population but 39% of top performers. Lone Wolves are 15% of salespeople but 25% of top performers. What distinguishes Challenger sales people? According the CEB’s analysis Challengers sell by teaching tailoring and controlling the sales process. Challengers pitch customers in five steps. First instead of asking “What problems do you the customer have?” Challengers they warm up the prospect and build credibility by providing some relevant data or insight. Next and this is the most important part they Reframe the conversation. They teach the customer that their current world view is flawed in some way. This judo move changes the power dynamic in the relationship. The salesperson becomes an expert and the customer wants to continue the conversation to learn more about why their current worldview isn’t optimal and how to fix it. The next three steps of the Challenger sales process are similar to other models of selling. Next Challengers salespeople Prove the Business Case. Fourth they Emotionally Involve the customer in the story crafting a narrative in which the customer identifies with the pain points and comes to believe his/her worldview needs to evolve. Last the sales rep paints the New Way Forward in which the product plays a key role. Challengers are effective sales people in low complexity products but outshine the other types in complex products. Of course successful salespeople come in all forms. But it’s interesting to see the CEB’s conclusions about the Challenger salesperson as a disproportionately more effective sales technique. Published 2015-02-13,Published 2015-02-13

I had been there only for a few quarters so I was startled when he asked. I had never viewed our business this way but after he asked the question I wondered why I hadn’t. It seemed obvious in retrospect. What started as a simple question became a complex and insightful exercise. Over his first week or so through many interviews like mine Scott developed that equation for AdSense and it filled a whiteboard. I’ve reproduced it above in a simplified form. Scott plied the equation to grasp how the business worked. He refined and polished the equation until he identified all the contributing parts to revenue. These questions led him to understand historical product development decisions advertiser and publisher policies and the values of the company. They revealed the strengths of the company but also made plain many assumptions underpinning previous decisions were no longer true. Identifying those inaccuracies and correcting them unlocked tremendous revenue growth. The equation became an important management tool in our conversations. When we discussed new projects Scott would ask me to point on the whiteboard where the project it fit within the equation - which lever the project impacted and whether the project could materially accelerate revenue growth. Boy did it clarify priorities. This equation remained on his office white board for years. Every time I walked past his office I would glance at that equation I’d smile. What an incisive management tool. More than helping to question assumptions prioritize projects and align teams the idea of a single equation diagnose the best place to focus. A 5% increase in each of the top line metrics would bolster revenue by 5%. But a 5% increase in impressions meant more publisher acquisitions. In contrast a 5% increase in cost per click implied more advertiser acquisition. Depending on the comparative unit economics of at the time Scott could recommend the right path. Here’s a first order equation for a SaaS company: And one for a market place: After that experience I’ve come to believe using the fundamental equation of a business can be a terrific best practice for prioritizing key initiatives across product marketing sales and customer success. It’s also a great tool to elevate a team conversation from the everyday tasks to more strategic initiatives. Published 2015-10-01,Published 2015-10-01
http://tomtunguz.com/amazons-key-tenets/,Willing to be misunderstood,Willing to be misunderstood Jeff Bezos appeared on Charlie rose two weeks ago and spoke about Amazon’s history future and best of all its culture. In the interview Bezos discussed Amazon’s core values: We are willing to be misunderstood We are obsessed with customers not competitors. We are long term thinkers While all of them are critical to Amazon’s success my favorite is the first because it combines three critical concepts for startups. First it requires knowing a secret in the Peter Thiel sense of the word seeing something in the market that very few others understand. Second it requires systems thinking understanding where a new product fits into the market place and how to leverage a company’s assets to best deliver the product to customers. Third it requires conviction belief in the product and market even when others are deriding the notion and investors are pushing the company to achieve quarterly targets. This is the willingness to be misunderstood. Today it’s not technology that creates barriers to entry in a market. Amazon Web Services has radically reduced the costs of deploying software. Instead culture process and institutional knowledge create the moats. Culture attracts talent. Process builds expertise the institutional knowledge that allows a company to serve a customer best. When you think about your startup make sure you have all three ingredients: a secret a strong go-to-market strategy and the willingness/conviction to be misunderstood. These are the foundations of great companies. Published 2012-12-06,Published 2012-12-06
http://tomtunguz.com/fitbit/,The Early Winners in the Consumer Hardware Wave,The Early Winners in the Consumer Hardware Wave There’s a “new” $4B startup today. A consumer hardware company called FitBit started trading on the Nasdaq this morning and it’s an impressive success story. We’ve examined the tremendous revenue growth GoPro experienced in a previous post. Impressively FitBit is growing faster. As the chart above shows FitBit grew from $14M to $76M to $271M to $745M in revenue in four years generating astounding growth rate of 170% per year. Of late FitBit ’s growth rate has begun to outpace GoPro’s growth rate. FitBit which sells a range of fitness trackers at around $100 price point operates at roughly the same gross margin (50%) as GoPro though FitBit’s margins are rising while GoPro’s are flat. Impressively FitBit spends about 10% points less in sales and marketing than GoPro to achieve a faster growth rate. And the company invests less in Research and Development. GoPro’s R&D spend has increased of late presumably driven by increasing competition in the marketplace forcing the company to develop differentiated products. This is a challenge that FitBit also faces from Apple’s Watch and other fitness trackers. And in terms of cash both companies are operating at roughly the same level: roughly 1 to 3% cash from operations as a percentage of revenue. In summary both FitBit and GoPro have created massive consumer hardware companies that sustain incredible growth rates while generating profits. Both companies have faced substantial competitive pressure to differentiate their products and outmarket and outsell their competition. These two companies are among the first winners in the venture-backed consumer hardware world a trend that is very likely to continue. Published 2015-06-18,Published 2015-06-18

It’s the same loyalty I displayed when I campaigned for Apple in the mid-90s. But with a tinge of betrayal. I reminisce about spending hours sifting through Zapf dingbats to transform PC Word files into usable Mac documents; choosing from a threadbare gaming library comprising three titles: Bungie’s Marathon series SimCity and Civ; and waiting years for updates to Quicken and the Office Suite. It’s like deja vu all over again. Android’s software offering is smaller inferior and slower to market than iOS. History doesn’t repeat itself but it does rhyme. In the late 90s Apple’s market share hovered around 5%. Unlike Apple Android doesn’t suffer from a marketshare disadvantage. On the contrary Android is used by a 51% of American smart phone users. Instead Android suffers from a mindshare disadvantage: the savviest technologists prefer Apple products. And for good reason. It’s fair to fault Android’s device and OS fragmentation challenges second-rate hardware and software integration content availability. But Android has strokes of brilliance: the intelligent notifications bar Google Now fully functional navigation true multi-tasking and my favorite: the Intents system which enables applications to send data to each other. Most importantly I love Android’s dream. Android’s vision is to be the developer’s platform. Google uses the word hacker at its developer conferences. Hugo Barra the head PM for Android called on developers to “Hack the Nexus” a phrase never to be uttered about an iPhone at WWDC. This message should resonate with the developer community but successful app development is still too challenging on Android for the reasons listed above. My passion for Android is every bit as irrational as my loyalty to Apple in the late 90s. I’d never thought I’d root against Apple. I guess I just have a thing for the underdog.

http://tomtunguz.com/revenue-at-risk-calculations/,Quantifying a SaaS Startup's Revenue at Risk,Quantifying a SaaS Startup's Revenue at Risk One of the key metrics that I don’t think gets enough notice when reviewing the health of a SaaS business is revenue-at-risk or RaR. For SaaS businesses with quarterly or annual contracts each month some subset of the customer base’s contracts must be renewed. The RaR is the sum of the revenue from these customers in a given month or quarter. RaR is a useful measure because it captures the company’s opportunity to minimize lost customer revenue. Identifying customers at risk and proactively engaging them cultivating a relationship and providing them account support can meaningfully improve a SaaS company’s churn rates. I’ve seen two ways to calculate RAR: a probabilistic method and a customer-by-customer method. The probabilistic method multiplies the MRR by the historical monthly revenue churn rate. That figure is multiplied by 12 to annualize it. Probablistic_RAR = MRR x Revenue_Churn_Rate x 12 The probabilistic RAR is top-down so isn’t as accurate as the bottoms-up method. For example some customers may have previously expressed a desire to renew in which case their contribution to RAR should be excluded. The probabilistic RAR has a tendency to over-estimate the figure but it’s useful as a back-of-the-envelope figure. The more accurate method customer-by-customer RAR requires each account manager or salesperson to keep accurate records in a CRM about a customer’s likelihood to churn. If that data is accurate calculating the customer-by-customer RAR involves summing the revenue of those likely-to-churn customers by month. Once RaR is measured then the company can begin to measure RaR-save-rate the fraction of RaR that is prevented from churning through the efforts of the customer success and/or sales teams. CbC_RAR = Σ Customers_Revenue_at_Risk It’s important to state that RAR isn’t constant throughout the year. RAR fluctuates depending on customer contract renewal schedules and fluctuations in sales teams bookings activity. Because of the variance throughout the year understanding Revenue-at-Risk is important for four reasons. First RaR estimates help with cash-planning to ensure achievement of a target growth rate. Second revenue-at-risk projections should be used to inform customer success staffing. Third RAR-save-rate can be employed as a benchmark of a customer success team’s effectiveness throughout the year. Fourth RAR is a tool to measure the effectiveness of the sales team in selecting the right customers to pitch. Revenue-at-risk is an important metric to monitor for SaaS startups particularly as they scale. Initially when churn rates are small implementing the systems to measure RaR may seem excessive. But as revenues grow sales teams swell and customer accounts multiply SaaS startups must able to estimate and manage churn effectively. For some code to generate a chart of Revenue-at-Risk see this blog post. Published 2014-04-23,Published 2014-04-23
http://tomtunguz.com/scfc-and-tleo/,The First Generation of the Talent Software Wars,The First Generation of the Talent Software Wars In the late 1990s two of the dominant talent management platforms were founded. Taleo and SuccessFactors grew very quickly after they entered the market bringing novel delivery to the human capital market. Both companies eventually offered talent acquisition performance management and learning tools for human resources teams. But they started in different places. Taleo initially focused on recruiting tools and SuccessFactors on performance management. As the chart above shows both companies scaled revenue rapidly reaching $100M in revenue 7 years after founding. SuccessFactors started out a bit slower but eventually grew about twice as fast as Taleo. Both companies were acquired around the same time. SAP purchased SuccessFactors for $3.4B in December 2011 and Oracle bought Taleo for $1.9B in February 2012. Company Revenue at IPO $M Customers at IPO ACV at IPO $k Year of IPO Years Since Founding SuccessFactors 39 1300 30 2007 6 Taleo 85 1000 85 2005 6 The companies pursued slight different strategies in the market. SuccessFactor’s average customer value (ACV) was less than half of Taleo’s according to each company’s S-1 document the filings related to an IPO. Interestingly despite the smaller contract sizes SuccessFactors invested substantially more in sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue to generate their top-line growth than Taleo. In fact SuccessFactors spent twice as much for at least three years. Both companies demonstrated very volatile sales efficiencies which are probably more influenced by the macro economic environment than the performance of the sales teams. Both of these business weathered the dot com crash in 2001 and the financial meltdown in 2008. SuccessFactors also generated slightly lower gross margins compared with Taleo. SuccessFactors generated a greater fraction of revenues from professional services throughout its life about 30-35% compared to Taleo which hovered around 20-25%. Professional services depress gross margins because they are often sold at cost or at negative gross margin. As a consequence of the substantial investment in sales and marketing SuccessFactors reached cash flow breakeven seven years after founding. Meanwhile Taleo broke through in year 3. The same story plays out with profitability. Taleo hovered around the profitability mark as soon as year 4 compared to year 8 for SuccessFactors. Both Taleo and SuccessFactors spent roughly equal amounts as a percent of revenue on engineering. At the time of their acquisitions SuccessFactors was growing more quickly than Taleo likely contributing to the 2x premium the company commanded in the M&A market. Additionally the business’ offering was widely perceived as being broader and more defensible. Published 2015-05-19,Published 2015-05-19

http://tomtunguz.com/how-much-is-a-business-worth/,How Much is Your Business Worth?,How Much is Your Business Worth? How much is my business worth? It’s a question every entrepreneur founder and business owner asks themselves. This is particularly true during acquisition conversations with a prospective buyer. Because most companies are privately held the acquisition details of the roughly 10000 businesses who sell themselves for less than $500M each year in the US remain hidden. There are enormous forces at play in the M&A market that indicate M&A activity will increase substantially in the next few years. Consequently every business leader ought to develop and maintain a good understanding of their business’ market value. As the data in the chart above shows the amount of capital held by large public companies has roughly doubled from $675B to $1.2T in 5 years a burgeoning war-chest that will fuel increasing M&A activity for years to come. In addition to an abundance of public company capital for acquisitions private equity firms have amassed a 10 year high of $412B in dry powder more capital for M&A. Two years ago we invested in Axial a company which has capitalized on these trends and has since become the largest market place in the US for M&A transactions with more than 200 businesses joining the platform each week. Today Axial released a valuation tool to help CEOs all over the US estimate the value of their business. Axial’s Valuation Tool uses discounted cash flow analysis and collects a few bits of information about a company to provide a Zillow-like Zestimate of a company’s value. Because the DCF model uses profitability as a core variable the estimator won’t work for many startups whose main concern is growth. But for the millions of businesses in the US which do generate a profit Axial’s Valuation Tool works very well. In addition to helping business owners understand the value of their business Axial connects business owners with acquirers lenders and investors providing entrepreneurs clarity in a traditionally opaque market. Last the company provides advice and guidance on how to start and manage M&A processes. The Internet has a unique ability to create more efficient market places and networks. We’ve seen it with classifieds and collectibles real estate and resumes. Axial’s ambition is to do the same with in the $200B annual M&A market by helping founders and CEOs maximize the value of their companies. Published 2014-07-24,Published 2014-07-24
http://tomtunguz.com/defining-a-personal-api/,Defining a Personal API,Defining a Personal API The UK is just starting to enforce EU’s cookie consent law. Visit the FT for the first time in a while and you’ll see: In effect this law requires consumers to define a Personal API. Consumers carry a trove of data: browsing data ad click data friend network data and social sharing data. Web businesses have realized the value of that data ($12B in 2011). This EU law encourages consumers to become aware of the value of this data and manage it. The notion of a Personal API isn’t new. In fact we’ve all defined some parts of our personal API on Facebook. Facebook application install dialogue boxes prompt us to evaluate the cost-benefit of data sharing. Although results vary widely across applications these kinds of prompts curtail user adoption to the chagrin of developers. After Facebook increased the granularity of permissions on these boxes last year some developers observed a 20% decline in user installs. The increase in data collection transparency is inexorable because consumers are paying more attention. Since 2004 Facebook has been convincing users to share ever increasing amounts of data to dramatic effect. The company has erected the social infrastructure of the Internet. But the majority of Facebook users distrust the service. This fear isn’t unique to Facebook. New entrants including Path must also manage user trust. As a result of this fraying trust web businesses must refine a new core competency: convincing users to share their user data before experiencing an application. Part of the challenge is marketing a product’s allure. But this is the simpler problem. Update: the EU changed the bill immediately before it was signed into law to allow implied consent. By visiting the site a user accepts data use. Consumer education presents the more significant challenge. Most consumers don’t understand the mechanisms or implications of data sharing. First there is technology complexity. There are several flavors of cookie: browser sessions true cookies HTML5 local storage and mobile application local data store. Cookie consent restrictions are applied unevenly across these storage alternatives. Consumers need to be educated on the technical details of these alternatives. Second consumers will have to decide which data and how much data to share at the point they arrive on the website. Like a Facebook application install dialog box these cookie dialogs force a consumer to think about the cost/benefit: how much data am I trading for how much gain? It’s a significant cognitive load. Websites must articulate the additional value of user cookies on a user’s very first page view of every session. Third consumers may need tools to manage their data across the web the kinds of tools that Facebook Google and Twitter have already implemented. These tools keep a list of applications accessing user data and allow consumers to revoke access to a given application at any time. The notion of a personal API is inevitable. Both consumer demand and in some geographies government regulation is driving the web towards such a structure. Startups and web businesses' marketing is about to change significantly.

http://tomtunguz.com/simplicity-complexity-coin/,What's Wrong with the Internet of Things,What's Wrong with the Internet of Things At an Internet of Things conference last week I took part in a panel in which we discussed the future of connected devices. Will simple products win or will complex products dominate in the IoT? we were asked. I think the question misses the point and raises another problem about the Internet of Things more broadly. It’s not about Things. It’s about Services. Software-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service. Simplicity and complexity are two sides of the same coin. Great products are simple on the surface but devote tremendous energy under the surface to handle complexity on behalf of the user. Great products are like ducks. Ducks are calm above the water despite paddling furiously below it. For Internet of Things products to be successful user interfaces must be simple just as in any other product. It’s table stakes. The complexity that lies underneath should be tucked away. That’s the problem with the name Internet of Things or connected devices. The majority of the user value isn’t about the things at all but the services that power the things. In fact the most successful connected devices should disappear from a user’s mind altogether. That the devices are connected at all or even exist should simply be forgotten. Most of the magical technology experiences hide complexity with simplicity in this way. Apple’s motto “it just works” captures the notion succinctly. Hail an Uber with the push of a button while a logistics and voting system finds the right driver. Photograph a receipt on Expensify and have the contents automatically transcribed for you. Dig through data on Looker while a database creates the right queries to answer your question instantly. The promise of the internet of Things is a world where objects think on our behalf what I’m calling anticipatory computing for example checking into a flight automatically as I enter an airport terminal. Or an air conditioner that automatically changes its settings depending on the weather. In both those examples technology disappears into the background enabled by data. Data will lead the revolution. It will lead to a revolution in platforms that enable the collection and use of data like Electric Imp. The data will lead to a revolution in the analysis of that data and consequently in the infrastructure from server to database to business intelligence suite which is why 75% of companies surveyed by the Economist in 2013 are pursuing initiatives in the Internet of Things. While the initial winners in the IoT category will be consumer facing products I suspect the vast majority of market value creation will happen behind the scenes in service companies and database companies analysis companies and platform companies to build products that the end-user will never see: the SaaS and PaaS products that enable magic to happen. When we achieve that vision of intertwining data and technology to transform connected devices into forgettable wallflowers then the true promise of the Internet of Things will be realized and the moniker will simply vanish because it will be meaningless. At that point the real value will remain in the services behind the scenes processing terabytes of data to help people live better lives. Published 2014-05-20,Published 2014-05-20

http://tomtunguz.com/quota-attainment-diagnostic/,What Quota Attainment Reveals About Your SaaS Startup's Go to Market,What Quota Attainment Reveals About Your SaaS Startup's Go to Market Quota attainment is an incredibly powerful diagnostic tool when understanding your SaaS startup’s go-to-market health. Quota attainment measures both the success of individual account executives and the performance of the team. To achieve best-in-class quota attainment a startup must execute the go-to-market strategy well across five dimensions. First the startup must supply the sales team with a growing volume of high quality leads. SaaS companies generate leads in many ways including through sales development reps search engine marketing paid social lead capture on the home page events customer referrals evangelists and channel partners. Consistently growing qualified leads is essential to quota attainment. Second the startup must ramp sales people quickly. As SaaS companies scale most companies begin to hire aggressively in sales. In the early days a SaaS startup might have one or two sales people. Then they begin to hire one per quarter then one per month. Pretty quickly the company is hiring 12 to 16 reps per quarter. Sales hiring process and sales training become essential tools for success when hiring this many people to ensure each account executive’s success. New account executives must be trained learn the business understand the sales motions acquire techniques to handle customer objections and absorb the parlance of the industry and company. In addition fast ramp up periods imply sales people begin to book business earlier which reduces the company’s burn. Imagine a hypothetical SaaS company hiring 8 AEs per quarter. If the account executives aren’t trained well and they require 9 months to become productive (ie book business) then the company is paying 24 account executives salary none of whom are generating revenue. Fast ramp cycles also help sales managers understand which account executives are a good fit and which aren’t. Third quota attainment relies on efficient sales cycles. Setting aside industry specific considerations longer sales cycles indicate a lack of product market fit and/or an immature sales playbook. Longer sales cycles indicate the sales team is challenged to generate immediacy in the sales process. In contrast short sales cycles carry many advantages including faster improvement of the sales playbook more efficient growth of the company and simpler financial planning. Fourth close rate the percentage of qualified leads that ultimately convert into customers is a lagging indicator of the SDR team’s effectiveness and whether leads are being properly qualified before filling a sales person’s hopper. Last the average contract value of a customer reflects the strengths of a company’s positioning in the market and the quality of the product. Bill Macaitis would say the delta of the company’s NPS vs its competition. Quota attainment success is a composite go-to-market metric that when decomposed reveals where a SaaS startup’s go-to-market strategy is strong and where it needs work.

http://tomtunguz.com/clouds-and-prism/,Why PRISM May Herald a New Golden Age for P2P,Why PRISM May Herald a New Golden Age for P2P Over the past 15 years we’ve seen a wholesale migration of software development on the web towards cloud away from client/server models. The cloud offers many benefits: seamless upgrades synchronization of data across different devices and lesser hardware requirements. But the cloud centralizes all the data. All of our Dropbox files Google documents and emails are held within one or few companies' servers - which provides easy access for hackers and government. It’s unclear whether or not the PRISM affair will dramatically change the American public’s view of cloud software. But should a large wave of privacy sentiment sweep the country the natural response to cloud software would be an evolution towards peer-to-peer. Peer-to-peer communication fragments data storage amongst clients without the need for storage on a central server. Instead data is stored within one computer or across many different computers in a network most-often encrypted. A huge wave in the early 2000s peer-to-peer communication has become less visible of late. But that doesn’t mean its use hasn’t grown. The same technology that Napster brought to the masses for music file sharing is also powers Bitcoin payments Skype chats and privacy centric storage companies like AeroFS Wuala and many others. After a decade’s worth of investment in cloud technology one might argue that a wholesale reversal from cloud to rich applications and peer-to-peer communication is unrealistic. But the rise of the mobile application actually makes this transition easier. Many mobile applications are thick clients that use cloud services for synchronization but otherwise provide all their functionality locally. Swapping out cloud synchronization for peer-to-peer synchronization could provide a similar service to users while offering additional privacy. These rich clients could provide a huge installed base for peer-to-peer networks to bloom. Popular opinion is a fickle creature and if the millions of Internet users in the US suddenly decide to prioritize data security peer-to-peer consumer services will experience a tremendous revival.

http://tomtunguz.com/handwriting/,What Today’s Revolution in Publishing is Missing,What Today’s Revolution in Publishing is Missing There’s something beautiful about handwriting that we’ve never been able to capture on the Web. Handwriting has style a uniqueness to each writer and also an ability to capture the evolution of thought with crossed out words carats and interjected clauses and margins full of edits. The image above is my favorite from Emily Temple’s curation effort of a series of famous authors' manuscripts on a Tumblog. I was thinking about how much differently this blog feels to a reader than the above draft of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The Hound of the Baskervilles.” Doyle’s writing careful and well-spaced clean looks like Sherlock Holmes' hand and it gives a feeling of methodological study and thought. And most of all it is unique to Doyle. Other examples like Nabokov’s below confer a very different feeling of chaos and stress and long frenetic nights of writing. Unlike each of these manuscripts this blog no matter my emotion or state of mind always reads the same way. We have built CSS and font service provides like TypeKit to render blogs and publications with a sense of uniqueness and personality. And though those are both great innovations neither captures the character the emotions and the process of the author quite like handwriting. We’re in the midst of an evolution in publishing with platforms like Svbtle and Medium and others. Part of that evolution is design. Another is curation. A third development could be related to personality and evoking the uniqueness and the state of mind of each author. Imagine a font that changed its look depending on your state of mind rate of typing time of day. Wouldn’t that be something? I’m not sure we’ll ever be able to translate the emotion and personality and character of handwriting from paper to iPad. And perhaps the emoticon is the zenith of that effort. But if we could replicate handwriting I’m certain the web would be a richer more beautiful and more interesting place for it. Published 2013-05-01,Published 2013-05-01
http://tomtunguz.com/sales-hiring-strategies/,The Impact of Varying Sales Hiring Strategies on SaaS Startups,The Impact of Varying Sales Hiring Strategies on SaaS Startups What are the tradeoffs when considering different sales hiring plans and which is the right one for your startup? There are many different considerations in creating a sales hiring plan. Balancing them all can be tricky but thinking through the trade-offs is important to scaling the business well. First let’s compare the financial impact of three different sales hiring strategies: six sales people hired at once two sales people hired for each of three quarters and one sales person hired each month. In this hypothetical example the sales people have a $350k annual quota cost the startup $100k annually and achieve their quota over six months with the following attainment percentages by month: 0% 0% 25% 50% 75% 100%. The plot at the top of the post compares the MRR trajectory of these three sales strategies. No surprise that hiring the six sales people immediately grows the top line of the business faster. aAfter about the 8th month all sales strategies reach the same constant growth rate created by six sales people achieving quota. Next let’s look at the cash implications of each strategy. The chart below shows the net revenue so the total revenue minus costs of the sales people’s salaries. The Six At Once strategy is 3-4x more cash intensive at the beginning but the net revenue breaks zero one to two months before the other two strategies. In short the Six At Once strategy values growth over cash and on the other extreme the Two Per Quarter values slow and steady progress. These two simple models overlook some very important considerations when crafting a sales hiring strategy. Namely: Not every sales hire will be successful. It’s common to see sales attrition rates of 25%-50% annually. With employee turnover at those levels the negative cash impact of strategies like the six at once can be much larger and ultimately delay the revenue ramp for several months. This is important to model if only to understand the impact on the company’s burn rate. Not all startups building sales teams have built turn-key sales processes in which the customer is identified the sales process is mechanized the infrastructure to create sign and close contracts is in place and incentive structures are relatively well-crafted. In fact most won’t have so hiring large teams out-of-the-gate may lead to significant under-attainment of quota because of questions and uncertainty around the sales process. Sales materials may not be developed. Qualified lead flow may not be systematically generated. Customer objections may not be well understood and handled. Sales training efforts may not yet be mature enough to support large growth in the sales team. The company needs the right sales management in place to be able to handle a Six at Once strategy whereas more incremental strategies are much more natural for small product or engineering centric teams to digest. The addition of a sales team to a product-focused company will also alter and ultimately enrich the culture but the company may need some time to adjust. Understanding the impact of a sales hiring plan on a startup’s business is important both for good financial management of the company but also to ensure the company is able to meet its revenue targets. Because the sales team imposes demands on the marketing organization for leads and the engineering organization for product delivery and the finance organization for contracts and quotas growth in the sales organization will cascade into other teams as well. But this simple framework is a good way to get started understanding the impact a sales hiring plan might have on a startup. Published 2014-05-28,Published 2014-05-28
http://tomtunguz.com/social-disambiguation/,Debunking the Myths of Social Viral and Community,Debunking the Myths of Social Viral and Community What is a social product? This was the question Sandi MacPherson founder of Quibb posed to me over lunch earlier this week. In Startupland we bandy about terms like social social media virality and community when talking about products but it wasn’t until that moment that I stopped to think a bit more about what each word really means. Sandi has thought a lot about these concepts while building Quibb and she has some of the clearest points of view on social products I’ve encountered. These are my notes from that conversation: Social Social products have three parts: product (the technology) means of user acquisition/growth (virality) and community (people). The first part the product has three features: user profiles a relationship metaphor (follow/friend) and some kind of data stream/feed for content sharing. But just building a product with these three features isn’t anywhere close to enough to be successful. Next the service needs to grow. Viral The most natural growth mechanism for social products is through the network itself. This is virality. Viral products use invitation systems to grow quickly. Invitation systems include Facebook Connect refer-a-friend like Dropbox or team/clan structures like World of Warcraft. Virality is a marketing tactic. Virality belongs to the same category as SEO SEM content marketing affiliate channels because it’s a customer acquisition vector. Virality differs a bit from these others because successful viral acquisition requires deeper product integration than most advertising. Nevertheless virality is a marketing tactic one that is increasingly a science. Community But product and viral growth still aren’t enough. The least well understood documented and discussed but most important element of social products is community. Community is the x-factor. Communities aren’t products or part of the product. They are amalgamations of people who interact with each other in a certain context and a known set of norms and values. Communities are the lifeblood of social networks. Everything else is just infrastructure - an empty city. Communities often have very strong culture and values. Reddit encourages a subversive culture. Hacker News champions contentious debate. Tumblr and Instagram fetishize aesthetics. Quibb’s community strives for knowledge. Fostering communities requires the right chemistry. Mixing the user growth content moderation and set of values/norms to create the substrate for a vibrant city is a constant battle. Accidental Alchemy No one I know talks about how to build community. Perhaps that because many of the communities that exist today were created by happy accident. At some point they just worked and trying to find the root cause of that success is a fool’s errand because the success was the combination of a thousand little things. Maybe one day we’ll understand better how to consistently grow vibrant communities online. That all begins with first understanding the key parts of a social product.

http://tomtunguz.com/email-transparency/,Startup Best Practices 10 - Building Your Startup's Institutional Memory,Startup Best Practices 10 - Building Your Startup's Institutional Memory In 2013 with 40 employees Stripe adopted email transparency a policy that makes most emails public to everyone in the company. They posted an update in late 2014 about the success of email transparency with 164 employees. At first blush it may seem radical to funnel emails of 164 other people to everyone’s already overflowing inbox. But it works brilliantly because it creates a policy around Institutional Memory something very few companies do well. When I was a PM at Google the company operated thousands of internal email lists similarly to Stripe but powered by a technology from Stanford called Mailman. There were all kinds of mailing lists: tactical political comical. When I started I was told to copy the mailing list on each product team’s weekly meeting notes and other key conversations. It wasn’t until our team added a new member that the value of these email lists became apparent. During her first few days she read through the notes stored in email archive. She understood the history of the project including the origin the timeline the original ambition. In addition she internalized the context for the product and design decisions we had made our key relationships with other teams and many other nuances that would have taken much longer to appreciate without the email archive. Email transparency was just as valuable when I transferred a project ownership to another PM. All the context is indexed searchable and permanent. Empowered and enabled the new PM took the reins seamlessly in just a few days. Institutional Memory/Knowledge is one of the greatest competitive advantages a business builds. Many companies have unique expertise. Xero understands how to acquires SMBs through accountancies. WorkDay are masters of selling to large enterprises. New Relic Twilio and Stripe market to developers better than anyone else. The unique insights for product marketing and sales are each of these businesses greatest assets - they are the game plans for creating the strategic market advantage that led to their success. So much the better for the company if everyone in the business can operate with this knowledge. But very few companies invest the time to create and maintain this internal library because it requires time and effort. We all bristle at the idea of keeping wikis and intranets up to date. Email transparency is the most efficient way of building Institutional Memory because it’s mostly passive and integrated into our existing workflows. In addition to diffusing knowledge email transparency brings a host of other benefits. It builds trust among team members invites contributions from others outside the team coordinates disparate teams better. It’s never too early to start building and archiving institutional memory. Stripe started at 40. Thanks to Dustin whose tweet inspired this post. Published 2015-04-02,Published 2015-04-02
http://tomtunguz.com/the-dawn-of-the-voicetotext-era/,The Dawn of the Voice-to-Text Era,The Dawn of the Voice-to-Text Era We all type quite a bit. I’ve never measured how many words each day I type but I imagine it’s probably a few thousand each week between my laptop and my mobile phone and across emails and blog posts. And no one can deny the toll this takes on our wrists. In the past week I’ve been suffering from some carpal tunnel pain particularly as I’ve been coding more. Coding often requires all kinds of odd key combinations because of the varying syntaxes of CSS Ruby R MySQL and the English language. There are all kinds of solutions to this problem ergonomics being the first. But I can’t imagine in 10 years as the volume of indications continues to increase that we will all still be typing away on these primeval keyboards. So instead I’ve adopted dictation. Initially I used the built-in Apple dictation feature and then tried using Google’s. More recently I’ve switched entirely to Nuance’s Dragon. This blog post is entirely dictated and all of the posts for the last two weeks also. I remember using MacSpeak 10 years ago which was Apple’s speech recognition effort. Who could forget the frustration that followed the initial hope of being able to control a computer through voice? Since then huge leaps have been made. Today accuracy is close to 99%. A good analogy to demonstrate the progress might be comparing Apple’s Newton and the iPhone. In five years I believe voice will be as common a mode of data input as keyboards. It’s more natural to speak to a computer rather than type because the computer can respond at the pace of your thoughts. I spend less time responding to emails because of dictation. It’s also much faster pen these posts because instead of focusing on spelling or typing or corrections I’m focused on the content and the computer takes care of the rest. Startups are taking notice and beginning to differentiate through voice. Roobiq is a CRM that solves the data entry problem through voice. Siri and Google Now are the more obvious examples. These will only become more common and particularly on the phone. At first blush it might seem that the smart phone ushered out the era of voice in favor of SMS and short form messaging and mobile application use. After all what fraction of time spent on a mobile making telephone calls? But a more accurate refinement of that statement that the mobile phone ushered out the era of synchronous voice. The mobile phone will be the harbinger of the asynchronous voice-to-text era. And our wrists will be the better for it. Published 2013-06-05,Published 2013-06-05
http://tomtunguz.com/entrepreneurship-growth-perception-vs-reality/,Entrepreneurship growth: perception vs reality,Entrepreneurship growth: perception vs reality The flurry of media activity in entrepreneurship including the spate of new TV shows like X-Factor for tech and Shark Tank the refocus of the NYTimes and WSJ on technology and the number of entrepreneurs on mainstream magazine covers gave me the impression that entrepreneurship is on the rise. While this may be true in pockets like New York or California entrepreneurship in the US is shrinking - at least according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics and a report from the NYTimes: When Job Creation Engines Stop at Just One For decades new companies have produced most of the country’s job growth. Without start-ups the country would have had a net increase in jobs in only seven years since 1977. The number of people employed by new businesses peaked in 1999 the height of the tech bubble and has fallen by 46 percent since then to 2.5 million in 2011 creating a slow leak in job creation that has proved difficult to plug. “There’s this idea that we can somehow rely on entrepreneurship to get us out of the job crisis” said Scott Shane an economics professor at Case Western Reserve University. “That’s getting harder and harder considering there are fewer and fewer of them and they’re each employing fewer people.” Entrepreneurship is the engine of growth for the US. We should be doing everything we can to cultivate it: relaxing H1B visa laws providing better access to capital through banks and the SBA and fostering the communities to support and educate new entrepreneurs.

http://tomtunguz.com/successful-smb-saas-startups/,The Defining Characteristics of Successful SMB SaaS Startups,The Defining Characteristics of Successful SMB SaaS Startups At first glance SMB SaaS companies those who sell Software-as-a-Service to small to medium businesses may seem like any other software company. But they are quite a different breed. Successful SMB SaaS companies have reinvented their businesses eschewing the expensive enterprise sales model in favor of end-user centric marketing support and product development. These businesses often look more like consumer startups than enterprise startups. It’s all because of the nature of the market. Market Dynamics SMB SaaS companies sell to a highly fragmented market. See the table below comparing the enterprise and SMB segments by number of firms employees and payroll. Co. Size Firms in k Employees in M Payroll in $B Employees/Firm Payroll/Firm in $M 1 to 500 5749 56.2 2085 10 0.36 Greater than 500 17.5 58.2 2771 3326 158 Source: US Census There are about 17500 enterprises with greater than 500 employees compared to 5.8M SMBs. The average traditional enterprise software company sells to firms with 3300 employees whose average payroll is $160M annually. On the other hand SMB SaaS companies sell to firms with 10 employees and $400k in annual payroll. Clearly these are two very different segments. Encouragingly the market size for enterprise software is roughly equal to the market size for the SMB market: about 57M potential seats in each. Of course the true number depends on the market segment: sales HR payroll expense management etc. Shifting from Customer Acquisition from Field Sales to Customer Support As a result of the fragmentation SMB SaaS companies need to reach and market to 1000 times more companies than their enterprise counterparts. Obviously this requires a new sales process. No White Papers; Just Mass Media Marketing Typically this sales process leads with a product that excites users and triggers word of mouth sharing and blog posts and news articles. Direct sales powered by quota carrying relationship building salespeople aren’t profitable at this scale. Instead mass media channels must be used: press mobile app stores (iOS & Android) web app stores (Chrome Google Apps Intuit and Force). Customer Support Becomes the Sales Team This huge number of customers imply every customer support rep must handle hundreds to thousands of customers per year instead of ones or tens of customers typical with enterprise focused companies. Customer support becomes an inside sales team. They drive upsells and cross-sells through webinars and blogging and support emails. End User Centric Development The product development cycle also differs. Without enterprise customers there are no enterprise commitments. No promises to customers about releasing features on particular dates or paid upgrade cycles. It’s all subscription. Take it or leave it. Product Offers a 2 Step Value Proposition The most successful SMB SaaS products typically offer a 2 step value proposition: an initial value proposition to the end user and a longer term value proposition to a manager/decision maker. Expensify offers simple expense reports to the end user just by scanning receipts. To the controller/VP of Finance Expensify offers better compliance with spend policies a huge challenge for most companies of any scale. Similarly Salesforce offered easier to use CRM to salespeople and better metrics for the sales manager. Yammer offers employees a better communication mechanism to end users and offered the IT department compliance controls. Product Closes the Loop and Reinforces the Efforts of Marketing and Support The end user value proposition drives press and word of mouth sharing. This increases marketing budget effectiveness. Effective SMB products also prequalify customers through the Product Qualified Lead. Know Thy Market By first appreciating the radically different nature of the SMB market and second by shaping the business to meet the demands of that market startups serving SMBs can grow and scale and become hugely successful. But it all starts with a good understanding of the fragmented nature of the market. Published 2013-04-17,Published 2013-04-17
http://tomtunguz.com/ben-franklin-effect/,The Things You Do Often Create the Things You Believe,The Things You Do Often Create the Things You Believe The process of creating the right culture in a startup has always been mysterious to me. Each company’s culture evolves in its own way. I’ve wondered whether the culture is set by the personalities of the founders or prominently displayed value statements and mission or biases purposely imposed in the hiring processes like Google’s googliness filter. Or is understanding the psychological forces at play among employees the most important element? Maria Popova the editor of Brain Pickings recently wrote about one of these psychological forces called the Ben Franklin effect. She extracted this concept from a book on common self-delusions called You Are Now Less Dumb. In the post which is very much worth reading she writes we seem to believe that “we do nice things to people we like and bad things to those we dislike.” But the Franklin Effect rejects that idea. Our actions mold our beliefs not the other way around. Quoting from the book: Your attitudes came from actions that led to observations that led to explanations that led to beliefs. Your actions tend to chisel away at the raw marble of your persona carving into being the self you experience from day to day. It doesn’t feel that way though. To conscious experience it feels as if you were the one holding the chisel motivated by existing thoughts and beliefs. It feels as though the person wearing your pants performed actions consistent with your established character yet there is plenty of research suggesting otherwise. The things you do often create the things you believe. If the Ben Franklin effect is real and we reconcile our values to our actions culture isn’t first written on a piece of paper and then manifested in the company. It’s the other way around. Employees’ behavior creates the culture which are then written down and posted on the wall. In which case a startup’s most effective tool to influence culture is its hiring process. To create a strong culture founders must select the candidates who will act in the ways consistent with the company’s values. Much easier said than done particularly in this competitive talent-market. But at least with the Franklin Effect there’s some research to defend the hiring process.

http://tomtunguz.com/crafting-a-pricing-plan-to-maximize-freemium-growth/,Crafting a Pricing Plan to Maximize Freemium Growth,Crafting a Pricing Plan to Maximize Freemium Growth The three tier feature based pricing model is so common it’s almost a cliché. For some businesses it works well. But as Kenny van Zant explained to me feature based pricing can slow growth in freemium businesses in two ways: first feature based pricing creates incentives within a company to offer a subpar product and consequently creates unnecessary friction in the adoption process slowing growth. Both of these challenges arise when the pricing model is applied to end users instead of the right target the manager. Freemium businesses disrupt incumbents by dramatically reducing the costs of customer acquisition. Instead of a single step top down enterprise sales process freemium businesses break the sales process into two parts: community building and prequalified close. By granting free access to a great product a freemium business develops a community of evangelists within an organization that foster demand for a product. This demand will eventually convince a manager to purchase the product on behalf of the team goaded by the social proof of a large fraction of employees using the product. Freemium businesses rely on a top-notch product to attract users but feature based pricing plans can undermine that strategy. Imagine a successful bottoms-up freemium SaaS business. The product team has built a great new feature that will drive engagement and delight users. They speak with the marketing team about the launch. The marketing team whose ambition is to drive up-sells to higher pricing tiers will push the product team to release the great new feature only for the most expensive tier to entice upgrades. Since most businesses even SMB SaaS businesses follow the 80/20 Pareto rule where the majority of revenue is generated by a small minority of customers this marketing decision restrics the great new feature to a small subset of the user base. The compelling product that formerly drove bottoms up adoption is now only available to the end users who pay the most an antithetical result that will ultimately hurt the marketing funnel. These misaligned goals come about because the pricing plan is incorrectly targeted to the end user. Instead the management functionality not the end user’s experience should change depending on a customer’s willingness to pay. Yammer’s user experience never changed when a customer converted from free to paid. The driving factor to conversion wasn’t the end user but IT’s desire for control. For Expensify the same is true. The paid product features satisfy the needs of accountants and company finance teams not end users. To maximize growth the end user should be using the same product whether free or paid. Tiered pricing plans for freemium business work best when the feature differentiation targets managers not end users. Which customer base does your pricing plan target?

http://tomtunguz.com/founders-as-ceos-in-saas/,3 Questions about Founders as CEOs in SaaS Companies,3 Questions about Founders as CEOs in SaaS Companies What percentage of SaaS IPOs in the last four years have the founding CEOs of the business been CEO at the time of IPO? 62.5%. In about two thirds of SaaS IPOs from 2011-2014 the founding CEO is the current CEO. Is there a meaningful difference between the equity stake of a founder who is CEO at IPO and a founder who is no longer CEO? About 1.1 percentage points. Founder/CEOs retain 15.5% of the company while founders/ex-CEOs retain 14.4%. The original equity allocation among founders ongoing employment at the company and the dilutive impact of venture capital are far bigger determinants of equity at IPO than current role. The chart above shows the broad spread of equity holdings by CEOs immediately before the IPO as reported in each company’s S-1. They vary from 5% to 53% an amazing range. In what fraction of cases does the founding CEO remain at the company? Of the cases I surveyed all but one of the founding CEOs remained with the business. They typically became Chief Product Officer Chief Technology Officer or Chairman of the Board. – I’m happy to see that more than the majority of founders of these public companies have remained at the helm of their companies through IPO and beyond. I’m also thrilled that the dilutive impact to founders who hire someone else to lead their company is minimal. And the data shows both founder and non-founder CEOs can lead to huge outcomes (LinkedIn and Workday are the two most salient examples.) As the data attests and as Reid Hoffman wrote in his post If Why and How Founders Should Hire “Professional” CEOs “Both approaches can work which means that as an entrepreneur you should focus less on what’s fashionable and more on what’s right for you.” Published 2015-01-06,Published 2015-01-06
http://tomtunguz.com/professional_services_margins/,When Should Your SaaS Startup Offer Professional Services,When Should Your SaaS Startup Offer Professional Services As the next generation of SaaS companies achieve maturity they have begun to serve larger and larger customers who in addition to demanding a great product often request services. Professional services as they are often called entail training and customization. For product driven startups the decision to offer professional services is a tricky one. On one hand the customer is always right and services often enable substantially larger contracts. On the other hand selling hours to drive revenue decreases the efficiency of the business by hiring more people in order to grow revenue linearly. In addition many businesses operate their services divisions at a loss. But not all. The chart above compares the gross margins on professional services across the 13 publicly traded SaaS with the largest average revenue per customer which ranges from $50-$800K for the 2015 fiscal year where available and otherwise the last disclosed year before acquisition. Some of these companies generate upwards of 30% of their revenue from professional services. So the profitability of this unit impacts the overall profitability of the business. While Jive and Hortonworks lose about forty cents per dollar of professional services the negative gross margin contingent constitutes the minority in this data set. There is an outlier: MobileIron generates 61% gross margin on services which is close to their software margin (81%) and closer still to the median across public traded software companies of 70%. This is because MobileIron offers both licenses and software subscriptions. The annual support contracts for the licenses bump up the gross margin quite a bit. So it’s not quite apples to apples. The remaining gross margin positive companies tend to operate their professional services teams at somewhere between 15 to 25 points of margin. The greater the fraction revenue from professional services the larger the gross margins tend to be. Again this is likely because of the substantial influence over the overall economics of the business. If the professional services team represents 30% of revenue and is operating at a negative margin then the overall margins of the business suffer greatly. Hortonworks in the bottom right is an outlier – though I suspect this is a deliberate strategy to win share in a competitive market with a commodity open source product. Typically larger average revenue per customer contracts enable better margins. This is logical. If a customer spends $500000 per year on software the marginal cost of $150k in services in order to make sure the deployment succeeds seems like a relatively cheap insurance policy even at high margin. After all there is an internal champion who pushed the purchasing decision through procurement and is for all intents and purposes pot committed to ensuring success. On the other hand the stakes aren’t so large for a $20000 per year product. Consequently the willingness to pay for professional services diminishes as a function of price point. Again MobileIron is an outlier because of its license software business. The decision to offer professional services shouldn’t be taken lightly. It requires staffing a new team crafting an offering to customers and modeling the financial impact to the business. The data suggests that customers are willing to pay 20%+ margins on price points of greater than $200000. Less than that price point the data shows it to be difficult to operate a professional services team at better than breakeven. Published 2015-05-31,Published 2015-05-31
http://tomtunguz.com/fastest-growing-areas-investment-2015/,The Fastest Growing Areas of Startup Investment in 2015,The Fastest Growing Areas of Startup Investment in 2015 Earlier this week we examined the trends in the major categories of startup investment including eCommerce Software Social Networking and Education. But which lesser known startup sectors are starting to raise venture dollars? Where are founders finding unique opportunities to innovate? Bitcoin is the fastest growing sector followed by photo sharing and physical storage (which includes moving and self storage companies). Each year starting in mid-2012 through mid-2015 these sectors have grown their investment dollars by more than 145% according to Mattermark data. The rest of the list controverts the notion that startups and investors pursue only incremental innovations. Space travel startups look to conquer the final frontier. In addition founders have raised capital to transform many of the fundamental industries: transportation hospitality lending health insurance and banking. But photosharing inevitably continues to grow quickly too. If we examine the relative share of dollars raised in the last 12 months by each of these categories we observe that quite a few like bitcoin physical storage drones and classifieds represent a minuscule fraction of the total invested dollars - less than 20 basis points. Others like transportation and hospitality fueled by Uber and AirBnB fundraising efforts command more than 6% of the billions invested in the last 12 months. Let’s look at the sectors with negative growth rates where startups are raising less money over time. Semiconductor investment fell 31% per year. Email startups raised 22% less. Dating contracted by 9% annually. And the worst performing category: deal sites whose total raised fell by 48% per year. In some cases the causes for contraction in these categories is evident. Groupon dominates the deal market and so room for new entrants is scarce. Semiconductor startups are constrained by a very small number of foundries who can manufacture their equipment and compete with incumbents like Intel and TSMC whose massive balance sheets can finance cutting edge research. Email and dating’s decline are less obvious. Nevertheless we should continue to see a greater variance in areas of startup investment over the next few years. As the total amount of venture capital rockets toward historic records founders will pursue areas of lesser competition where differentiation is easier consequently creating an advantage for the company when recruiting talent and raising capital. In addition investors will seek under-explored areas to finance looking for great returns. Published 2015-07-14,Published 2015-07-14
http://tomtunguz.com/mega-rounds-and-ipos-impact/,Are Tech IPOs Dying?,Are Tech IPOs Dying? Earlier this week in a post on Quartz Mark DeCambre asks the question Are IPOs Dying Because of Huge Growth Rounds? The chart above shows the 36 year trend in the number of tech IPOs. And as DeCambre points out so far through 2014 the ten largest startup financings have yielded about twice as much capital as the ten largest IPOs. To paraphrase Mark’s question can startups raise just as much capital in the private markets as in the public market without the hassle of public market regulation? Let’s look at the trends over the past decade and across all IPOs and MegaRounds to get a better sense of the trends in the number of MegaRounds and IPOs the total amount of capital raised by startups using each mechanism and the average round size over the past decade. This larger dataset should be more representative than the top 10. Note I’m excluding Facebook’s IPO in 2012 as an outlier and I’ve adjusted for inflation. The chart above compares the total number of MegaRounds those VC investments of $50M or more from 2001 through 2013. In the past four years MegaRounds have more than doubled in number from 20 to 40 and have increased every year. Last year there was 1 MegaRound for every 2 IPOs. In 2012 there were 3 MegaRounds for every 4 IPOs. In short MegaRounds are increasingly common while the number of VC-backed IPOs is relatively constant. The trend is similar in the total amount of capital raised: MegaRounds are becoming more important in the ecosystem. But MegaRounds haven’t surpassed IPOs for total capital contribution. Over the last three years in aggregate startups have raised about 3x the capital in IPOs as from MegaRounds. The total number of dollars from MegaRounds is much more consistent than the relatively volatile public markets and those dollars are growing at a 22% CAGR. Last let’s contrast the average amount raised in a MegaRound and an IPO. In the last four years the average MegaRound generates $94M in capital while the typical IPO raises $147M a material 50% difference. This delta may be caused by many things. But I suspect the most important factor is startups who raise MegaRounds use these financings to delay IPO. The MegaRounds of today are the same size as the IPOs of five or ten years ago. In some sense they have replaced those IPOs. But MegaRounds haven’t cannibalized IPOs altogether. These MegaRounds typically aren’t providing the same type of liquidity to founders and investors as a true public offering though many of them do have substantial secondary share sale components to founders and employees. Rather they empower startups to remain private longer and continue to grow which enables them to command higher valuations and raise more capital at IPO. The rise of MegaRounds as a new financing tool for founders is a terrific development for founders. As the amount of capital entering venture capital has exploded we can expect more and more of these MegaRounds and consequently we should also see much larger IPOs than we have in the past ten years.

http://tomtunguz.com/consumer-investment-fatigue/,Consumer investment fatigue,Consumer investment fatigue Many of the promising marketing and media innovations of the past six years daily deals subscription ecommerce social gaming and social media have been struggling. This trend is plain to see from IPO performance and negative press cycles. I’ve been asked a few times whether there is consumer investment fatigue as a result. Fatigue is too strong a characterization. It would be foolish for any investor to write off consumer investing as a category because of the massive opportunity consumer internet companies offer. The fastest growing and often the largest Internet businesses are consumer businesses: Google Amazon Facebook Instagram Pinterest to name a few. Instead investors are faced with a choice between two strategies. Option 1: pursue a contrarian growth strategy investing in a few consumer Internet companies at similar prices to the previous several years. Implicitly these investment are bets that new more lucrative and sustainable revenue streams or more cost effective distribution channels will develop in the next 1 to 3 years that will enable these startups to grow into their valuations with time. Option 2: pursue a value strategy valuing new consumer companies as traditional ecommerce businesses or internet media businesses rather than conferring the large strategic multiples afforded these businesses over the past 24 months. Invest much earlier and much more broadly expecting a lower average outcome. It’s too early to tell which strategy is better. It depends on the incumbents successfully developing new revenue models that can be either syndicated to or replicated by new startups. Perhaps new mobile ad technology will enable social networks to flourish. Or changes in app distribution will suddenly render social gaming unit economics much more profitable. Who knows? But consumer investment will continue. Published 2012-08-29,Published 2012-08-29
http://tomtunguz.com/implications-big-round/,The Implications of Raising a High-Priced Round,The Implications of Raising a High-Priced Round When we say a startup has raised a big round we often mean the round is big in two dimensions - total amount invested and valuation. And when we say a big valuation more precisely we imply the round was priced at a high revenue multiple. A SaaS company that will generate $400M in revenue next year that raises $200M at $1B valuation has raised a big round but at low valuation-to-revenue multiple of 2.5x. In contrast most high growth SaaS startups are raising at very high multiples somewhere between 10-20x forward revenues. What are the implications of raising at a large multiple? The startup’s founders have convinced investors of their company’s ability to grow quickly and predictably. Investors are willing to pay a price ahead of the company’s current fundamentals. Let’s look at the table below to make the point. Time Until Valuation Reaches Public Market Comparable Time Until Valuation Reaches Public Market Comparable Time Until Valuation Reaches Public Market Comparable Time Until Valuation Reaches Public Market Comparable Time Until Valuation Reaches Public Market Comparable Forward Multiple Forward Multiple 10x 15x 20x 25x 100% 0.4 1.1 1.7 2.4 CAGR 200% 0.2 0.5 0.9 1.2 300% 0.1 0.4 0.6 0.8 400% 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.6 Across the top valuation-to-forward-revenue multiples span 10x to 25x. Forward revenues means the sum of the next twelve months of projected revenue. From top to bottom the compound annual growth rate of revenue varies from 100% to 400%. Within each cell is how far forward an investor is paying relative to public market valuations. Take a company growing at 300% per year. Suppose they attract an investment at a 20x forward revenue multiple. The investor has paid 0.6 years or about 7 months ahead. In other words in 7 months the valuation-to-forward-revenue multiple will be equal to that of the top-tier of public market SaaS companies. The investor implicitly believes the company will continue to grow at the same CAGR at least until that point. While this doesn’t sound like a hugely risky bet remember this is 7 months past the next twelve months of revenue. So the investor is valuing the business based on the projected revenue the company will generate 19 months from now. Should the business not achieve its plan then the valuation of the business could be mismatched to its valuation creating a challenging subsequent fundraising. The more future-priced a round is the greater this risk. SaaS startups haven’t always been priced on forward multiples. Forward multiples are the most aggressive because they assume the company will achieve its plan for the next 12 months. They assume very little execution risk. Since SaaS companies are subscription businesses there’s a good argument that they are predictable assuming the macroeconomic environment remains stable. If/when the market should be more conservative investors will likely revert to pricing companies on trailing revenues rather than future revenues which would change this math materially. Why do I compare these multiples to the public markets? The fund raising market is a continuum. On the smallest end the continuum starts with angels and seed investors who invest tens or hundreds of thousands then early stage investors who invest millions to around ten million to growth investors who invest tens of millions to hundreds of millions to public investors who invest billions in a company. It’s the public markets who set the ultimate multiples. Public companies valuations or market capitalizations are updated each second as they trade on exchanges. They too trade on multiples. And the fastest growing most attractive SaaS companies trade at 7.2x forward-revenue-to-enterprise-value while growing 80-90% per year. When a startup goes public it will likely trade within that range. The chart above shows the forward revenue multiple across the four quartiles of publicly traded SaaS companies. Clearly growth is an important determinant of valuation. In fact growth influences public SaaS companies valuation more than any other metric. It’s 6x as correlated as gross margin and 7.5x as correlated as profitability. This is true in the public markets and the private markets. So how does a company entice an investor to pay as far forward as possible? Forward multiples increase when investors believe a business to be predictable - investors are assuming the execution of the business will achieve or beat plan. In addition there are many other important attributes to convey about the business: competitive barriers to entry sales efficiency credibility of the team ability to pitch strength of the brand attractiveness of the category unit economics the depth of the sales pipeline churn and sales cycle. When startups raise big rounds they’ve convinced investors their company will continue to grow very quickly and very predictability far into the future. Published 2015-08-09,Published 2015-08-09

Looking around you’ll notice the sunny outdoor patio where a chef once made enough paella in one enormous paellera for Looker’s 100 employees and you might sit at the long tables where they shared the feast. As you entered the building you would have passed a motorcycle glinting in the sun a gift from the company to an early engineer for his outstanding contributions to the business. Walking inside you’ll see all the Looker team members wearing t-shirts of their customers. All around the office you can feel the culture Frank Lloyd and the rest of the Looker team have imbued into company from the very earliest days. Today Looker is announcing a $30M round 400% annual growth and an impressive customer list that includes unicorns and publicly traded companies. As a student of SaaS companies I can say with confidence the numbers behind the business and the company’s progress are very exciting. But the most special thing about Looker isn’t the numbers. Instead it’s the unique chemistry of the team who have built Looker into what it is today; it’s this distinct culture that will accelerate and transform the business tomorrow. It’s the company’s relentless focus on defining its success by the success of its customers. Days like this that remind me that the most important things for startups have never been the numbers; they’ve always been the people and the culture. Published 2015-03-11,Published 2015-03-11
http://tomtunguz.com/unicorn-press-cycle/,The Tech Press Cycle and Unicorns,The Tech Press Cycle and Unicorns Just 25 months ago Aileen Lee coined the term unicorn in her post Welcome to the Unicorn Club and last week the Economist declared these Unicorns “Gored.” Over the span of those two years the Unicorn press cycle has swung from euphoric apotheosis to bleak nadir. The rise and fall of unicorns in the press isn’t a unique phenomenon. A company’s narrative moves like a clock: it starts at midnight ticking off the hours. The tone and sentiment about how a business is doing move from positive (sunrise midday) to negative (dusk darkness). And often the story returns to midnight rebirth and a new day… wrote Aaron Zamost a former manager of global communications at Google YouTube and currently head of communications at Square wrote about the press cycle. The truth of the matter for unicorns lies somewhere in between the night and the day. We don’t often talk about what success means for this class of companies. So what is it? For the founders and employees it’s not just the attainment of a $1B valuation. Success is a combination of financial gain work experience in a hyper-growth company and the pride of building a transformational company. Many of these companies will attain all of those things. We can argue about the degree of financial gain for each one but because unicorns are broadly distributed across consumer and enterprise sectors and within subsectors like transportation security sales software it’s irrational to argue that all of them will fail. There are many spectacular and disruptive businesses in the herd. If we evaluate these companies as a portfolio as investors do then unicorn success is measured by financial return. Early stage VCs who have invested in a portfolio of different unicorn companies will likely generate terrific returns. At a blended valuation of $100M post-money a Series A investor in a $1B company at IPO or sale records a 10x gain. Later stage investors like mutual funds and hedge funds simply have to break-even on their investments to perform similar to the S&P500 a common benchmark which is up just 1.65% for the year. There will be flameouts. There always are with startups at any stage. Our fascination with unicorns today has to do with the scale of the phenomenon: the number of companies at these valuations the amount of capital fueling their growth and the historic cash burn required to attain those growth rates - and the perceived risk with such high stakes. And it’s true that the boom-time fundraising market of the last few years has created some problems. The Economist enumerates three which all are legitimate: the desire to reach $1B in valuation for marketing/ego the multiple disparity between the public and private fundraising markets and an environment that is less discerning which businesses have strong business models and which have business models susceptible to changes in the fundraising climate. But we’re arriving at the point when the gloomy sentiment around these companies is unwarranted. Perhaps the mark-to-market accounting by mutual funds of recent investments is to blame. But that news may be deceptive because the valuation methodology and true financial performance isn’t known to the public. As the press tide turns let’s not forget these companies all aim to transform some industry segment and grow at historic rates. Many will succeed. Some will not. But in the end many of these companies will have transformed the world according to their mission. The negative press cycle is just another hurdle to overcome. To quote Teddy Roosevelt: It’s not the critic who counts; the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena. Published 2015-12-01,Published 2015-12-01
http://tomtunguz.com/moores-law-data/,A Moore's Law for Data,A Moore's Law for Data Since the first transistor increasing speed has been at the core of much innovation in Silicon Valley . Over more than three decades Moore’s Law has remained the engine of progress in chip technology. I’ve been wondering if a analogous productivity law will be written for data. One level up the stack from the chip software has benefitted tremendously from chip speed. I learned to code in Java which I needed to compile before I could test my program. Each compilation required 3 or 4 minutes and this latency slowed me down. In comparison the languages dominating today’s programming stacks provide instant feedback. I saw 90% time savings to write code when I shifted to Ruby. Two levels up the stack applications also profit from Moore’s law. Apps can process more data larger images bigger movie files - and all of it much faster than before. But no where is the benefit more apparent to me than in data processing. At Google I watched the company evolve its data processing technology from MapReduce to Dremel. Having left the Googleplex I still keep tabs on innovations like F1. Today companies outside of Google are replicating this transition from Hadoop to Impala to Spark and other databases. While that change may seem intangible much like an additional hundred million transistors squeezed onto a smaller chip the benefit is real concrete and massive. Today with Redshift and Looker a salesperson can analyze a few billion rows of data in a second. Not a data scientist or statistician or engineer. But a salesperson. The perfomance improvement throughout the entire stack from chip to database to application has reduced the feedback cycles to sub-second responses. The magnitude of that change can’t be overstated because it makes all the petabytes of data companies generate and collect useful to everyone in an organization. I hope there will be a power law written one day that shows as the amount of data processed increases geometrically the quality of decision-making within companies increases and so does their worth.

http://tomtunguz.com/series-a-overloaded/,The Series A Is Overloaded,The Series A Is Overloaded There’s a concept in computer programming called operator overloading that neatly describes the current Series A investment market. Overloading means using the same code for two very different purposes depending on inputs. For example a programmer could redefine the + function so that instead of adding two numbers the function would multiply the numbers if one of the numbers was negative. Overloading can create lots of confusion in programming because the same function name can return very different results. The Series A market is overloaded. In my book a Series A is the first round of financing with any single investor committing more than a $1M typically led by an institutional investor. But everyone has a different definition. A company may define a Series A any way they like or even give it a different name: I’ve seen Series 1 or even Series Cool. But I digress. In the market today three different types of Series A exist: the classic the juiced and the jumbo. The Classic Series A is your father’s $3 to $5M round. The typical company has 3 to 7 employees a product early in market with some data to support product market fit. The Juiced Series A ranges from $8 to $15M. Startups raising juiced Series As often have raised sizable seeds of $1.5M+ have teams approaching 20 people and have generated substantial market feedback. The check sizes resemble traditional Series B investments. The Jumbo Series A weighs in at $15 to $60M. Jumbo Series A startups tend to have been bootstrapped for quite a long time. The business is often well into revenue roughly speaking about $10M+ and is raising its first institutional capital to grow faster and bolster the balance sheet before an IPO. Given the recent rise of the latter two species of Series A one might be tempted to believe these rounds skew the financing market. Despite the substantially larger investment sizes the NVCA data shows the average Series A investment hasn’t changed substantially since the end of the dot-com era at roughly $5M. Because the Series A definition is overloaded and because juiced and jumbo Series As create disproportionate press coverage confusion about the state of the Series A market is inevitable. Looking past the terminology and into the data today’s Series A market is no different than at any time over the past ten years. Published 2013-08-29,Published 2013-08-29
http://tomtunguz.com/content-marketing-compounding-returns/,The Compounding Returns of Content Marketing,The Compounding Returns of Content Marketing A few weeks ago I joined Mike Volpe CMO of Hubspot on the Growth Show where we had a great time talking about a few SaaS topics. A few listeners to the podcast picked a line from that podcast that I think is a really important point for content marketing. I said “Content is one of the few forms of marketing that has a compounding return.” Like a bank account that starts out small and earns incremental gains but over time becomes quite large content marketing efforts require consistent investment but ultimately can yield enormous results. Hubspot’s efforts prove the maxim. The attract more than 1M readers per month to their blog. I’m going to use some of my own data and some hypothetical data to prove the point. Content isn’t just relevant for a day. Only about 1 ⁄3 of the views on a typical post on tomtunguz.com are generated on the first day. In fact the chart above shows the probability density function for the share of page views by blog post for the past year. The chart shows that the typical blog post will generate between 1x and 2x as much traffic with time. When creating a content marketing campaign marketers must be deliberate about their balance between evergreen content posts that are always interesting for readers and temporal content posts that are relevant just for a day or two. Evergreen posts often confer timeless advice. Temporal posts comment on recent events. Content marketing campaigns that skew in favor of more evergreen content will grow faster and bigger than those which focus on temporal content. Let’s contrast two hypothetical blogs. The first blog is an evergreen focused blog. Each post generates about 150 views on day one and about 20 each subsequent day. Posts views decay according to a modest decay function but still generate about 18 views per day a year later (this decay constant is based on this blog but the figures are different.) You can see the compounding effect clearly. In a year the blog is generating more than 250k visitors per month. Remember this is a hypothetical example with perfect execution. But the idea still holds. Content marketing value compounds. Contrast the evergreen strategy with a temporal strategy. In this example each blog post generates about 150 posts on the first day 20 on the second day but the decay function is much more aggressive. By the end of the year each post generates 1 view per day. This blog’s traffic caps out at about 70k visitors less than a third of the previous one. In reality content marketing campaigns balance evergreen and temporal content. While it may not generate long term returns temporal content keeps blogs fresh. But to benefit from the compounding effects of content marketing marketers should actively invest in building evergreen content that keeps contributing to traffic growth building the company’s brand and eventually generating sales.

During these two hours we will discuss the tactical issues and questions facing seed and Series A SaaS companies in a small group. That’s why we call them Office Hours. Rather than deliver presentations SaaS Office Hours are meant to be casual tactical and collaborative. Sometimes we’ll invite guests for off-the-cuff conversations and Q&A focused on focused questions like how should I build my startup’s marketing team? How can I evangelize my product to developers? How do I create the right kind of recruiting process? And we have a great lineup so far. On October 21st Bill Macaitis the CMO of Slack will kick off SaaS Office Hours to talk about early stage marketing. On November 4 we’ll chat with Kenny van Zant the creator of high velocity inside sales techniques and flywheel business models. Two weeks later SaaS Office Hours will host Pete Koomen founder of Optimizely to talk about product management from the very earliest days. And later in the year Maia Josebachvilli the VP of People & Strategy at Greenhouse will join us to share insights about recruiting metrics and Adam Gross head of product at Heroku and former VP of Platform and Developer Marketing at Salesforce about building developer products. Other times SaaS Office Hours will be structured like true office hours with one-on-one conversations with Redpoint partners to walk through tactical questions facing seed and Series A SaaS companies. To keep the conversations intimate we’ll cap the attendance at about 20-40 people. Every two weeks I’ll write a post about the upcoming speaker and topic and link to a registration page and we’ll invite a subset of people who register to the event. To that end we’re excited to welcome Bill Macaitis to SaaS Office Hours on October 21. Bill is an amazing marketing leader who has pioneered many of the data-driven marketing techniques in use today. In 2008 Bill joined Salesforce as SVP of Online Marketing and Operations. In 2012 Bill became CMO of Zendesk and in 2014 Bill joined Slack as CMO. Needless to say Bill has built some of the most unique and efficient marketing organizations in SaaS companies. Best of all Bill is a wonderfully nice guy. If you’re interested in attending please fill out the form at SaaS Office Hours. I’m really looking forward to this series of casual events focused on tactical issues. Through them I hope we can help early stage founders maximize the potential of their businesses and build some great friendships along the way. Published 2015-10-07,Published 2015-10-07
http://tomtunguz.com/2015-saas-multiples/,The Compression in SaaS Valuations,The Compression in SaaS Valuations In 2015 SaaS companies trade at a 30% lower multiple of revenue than last year. In early 2014 the typical SaaS company traded at about 9.2x their next-twelve-months of revenue. Since August 2014 that figure has dropped by about 30% to about 6.0x. Almost every public SaaS company has seen multiple compression. Only RealPage Qualys NewRelic ConstantContact and Hortonworks are at highs in 2015 compared to 2014. The other companies in this basket have have all fallen between 1% and 60%+. Xero which once traded at a 50x multiple (!) is down to 15x (still the highest multiple of all). Today there are fewer and fewer outliers companies trading at heady multiples compared to 2014. The red dots in the chart above mark outliers companies trading at multiples greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean. In the last few months all the outliers have disappeared - they now trade within a much narrower band: 5-10x next twelve months’ revenue. As far as I can tell the compression in the public market hasn’t impacted valuations in early venture rounds. Companies are growing faster than ever a very enticing attribute for investors and higher growth rates command premium valuations. Given the $50B raised by VCs this year half of the dollars raised in 2000 and the second highest amount in those 14 years there’s plenty of cash to chase exceptional early stage software companies and pay premiums to invest. But I wonder if this slow decline will impact prices in pre-IPO rounds and later stage growth rounds for SaaS companies. Or if perhaps valuations will remain the same but later stage investors will demand more downside protection or guaranteed returns when making investments because they can forecast with much greater certainty the upper and lower bound of a company’s value at IPO. “Structure” as it’s called in industry parlance has been a feature of several rounds in the most recent SaaS IPOs. The data doesn’t indicate unhealthy multiple acceleration which would have supported the idea of a bubble. Instead we’re observing a steady rationalization of multiples indicating investors have reached at least temporarily a consensus on how fast growing SaaS companies ought to be valued in the public markets. The most immediate impact to startups will be in the terms of growth rounds. I doubt these trends will alter early stage investing dynamics much at all. Published 2015-01-23,Published 2015-01-23
http://tomtunguz.com/content-marketing-lessons-learned/,Five Things I've Learned about Content Marketing Strategy,Five Things I've Learned about Content Marketing Strategy Content marketing is one of the most powerful marketing tools startups can employ. Blogs are powerful drivers of awareness and creators of purchasing intent which ultimately lead to new customers new employees or other new opportunities. This is doubly true as buyers are educating themselves before contacting sales teams to a far greater extent than ever. Below are the five things I wish I would have known when I first started writing this blog. I hope they are useful for anyone designing or redesigning a content marketing strategy. Be Very Clear About Your Goal We are all selling something whether it’s our ideas ourselves or our company’s products. For a a SaaS company a blog’s measure of worth is the rate at which it adds email subscribers to its newsletter. In the world of content marketing emails are the most direct way of translating page views into revenue. Each email address on that list is a lead for the sales team. The Fastest Way to Grow Traffic is to Post Elsewhere and Link Back Social email and direct traffic will form the basis for a consistent traffic stream. But the best way to attract large numbers of new readers is to post on other sites with broader traffic bases than yours and link back. If you don’t bring in new readers traffic will flatline. The Blog is a Lifecycle Marketing Tool Whatever you may be selling you should design your content to shepherd potential customers through a buying process: educate customers about a product area cultivate people into experts convince them to buy your product and equip them with the tools to close the sale internally. It’s important to identify your customer segments and publish content for each of the different stages in the buying process frequently. Law of Compounding Returns Like a bank account a blog demonstrates compounding returns. About half of pageviews to a post on this blog arrive after the day it was first published . So invest in blog posts whose relevance persists through time which called evergreen content and watch your audience grow. You Don’t Have Time for This You are only going to give me 48 seconds to read this post so I better get to the point fast. Write posts in inverted pyramid writing style which puts the most important points at the top of the article. In 48 seconds I can’t go very deep on a topic. Cut posts into smaller posts and crosslink posts to create longer pieces. Published 2015-01-30,Published 2015-01-30
http://tomtunguz.com/customer-success-cac/,How Customer Success Meaningfully Reduces Cost of Customer Acquisition,How Customer Success Meaningfully Reduces Cost of Customer Acquisition Thanks to Bill Macaitis current CMO at Slack and former CMO of Zendesk who inspired and co-authored this post When discussing customer success for SaaS startups the conversation focuses mostly on retaining customers and reducing churn. These are two fantastic benefits with meaningful return-on-investment. But great customer success organizations can meaningfully impact another critical part of the customer lifecycle customer acquisition by catalyzing evangelists to refer new customers. Let’s examine a hypothetical SaaS company that acquires 1000 customers though sales and marketing. Assume a standard 15 month payback period implying a CAC of $1250 per customer or $1.5M in aggregate. Each customer pays $1k annually to use the product. If customer success can convert 1 in 10 of those customers to evangelists each of whom refers only one other customer that year the company’s CAC drops by a third. Impact on Growth by Customer Success for Hypothetical SaaS Company Impact on Growth by Customer Success for Hypothetical SaaS Company Impact on Growth by Customer Success for Hypothetical SaaS Company Impact on Growth by Customer Success for Hypothetical SaaS Company Impact on Growth by Customer Success for Hypothetical SaaS Company Acquired Customers 1000 1000 1000 1000 % Evangelists 0% 10% 20% 30% Referrals per Evangelist 5 5 5 5 Effective CAC 1250 833 625 500 MRR $k 83 125 167 208 MRR Sales Efficiency* 1 1.5 2 2.5 I’ve modeled four different scenarios above and varied the fraction of the customer base that the customer success team converts to evangelists. According to SATMetrix the company behind the Net Promoter Score typical B2B companies have about 10-20% NPS on average so I’ve used those figures as the base case. The best-in-class companies achieve 60 NPS scores. Let’s examine the third scenario in a bit more detail. 20% of customers become evangelists and each refer 5 customers. The effective cost to acquire a customer falls by more than 50% the monthly recurring revenue (MRR) increases by 100% and the MRR sales efficiency also doubles. In short the impact of a great customer success team on every major SaaS metric can be dramatic. This growth effect compounds over time if the customer success team can continue to find and cultivate evangelists. The swelling ranks of promoters will become an increasingly meaningful and cost-effective growth engine for the business. While the math works out very neatly the challenge with this idea lies in accounting for referral properly. There are no water-tight mechanisms for attributing the source of a particular customer. Some companies ask evangelists to use links or codes to track referrals. Customer signup surveys asking new customers how they heard about the product is another effective mechanism. But these mechanisms won’t capture the entirety of referrals. Additionally the rewards from such an effort may take a while to materialize. As a result patience is important when building and managing a CS team. Published 2014-12-18,Published 2014-12-18
http://tomtunguz.com/app-distribution/,Mobile Social Networks: The New Customer Acquisition Powerhouse,Mobile Social Networks: The New Customer Acquisition Powerhouse There’s a force in mobile app distribution that isn’t talked about much despite its magnitude: mobile social networks. Mobile social nets are becoming the predominant mobile app paid discovery/distribution platforms. How big is this force? Line the Japanese mobile messenger with more than 200M users is on a $400M run rate 60% of which is derived from app distribution. Kakao Talk will pay out about $600M to developers this year - which is about 10% of iTunes global developer payout in 2012. Remember Kakao only serves Korea. Facebook’s mobile revenue will reach $2.5B this year driven by mobile CPI ads. In short these networks are huge user funnels and money-making machines. To achieve this scale these mobile social networks offer cost-effective customer acquisition by combining two network effects: user data aggregation and ad targeting data learning. In Line Kakao Talk and Facebook users sign up create profiles and communicate. Their frequent brief sessions during the day create torrents of demographic interest and behavior data for ad targeting. Additionally as the user base grows so does the ad inventory and app downloaders for developers to target. Ad performance is the second data network effect. After a user clicks to download an application his profile information and the app’s metadata (and sometimes usage data) are fed into a machine learning system that finds similar users and learns what works and what doesn’t. Additional ad performance data across a larger set of developers and app types compounds the effectiveness of the ad targeting system reinforcing its superiority. These two data advantages enable mobile social networks to create the most cost effective paid mobile customer acquisition channels for startups. Published 2013-08-30,Published 2013-08-30
http://tomtunguz.com/the-b-corporation/,The B Corporation: A Novel Structure for Mission Driven Startups,The B Corporation: A Novel Structure for Mission Driven Startups When starting a company founders often decide between two structures: the S-Corp and the LLC. But as James Surowiecki writes in “Companies with Benefits” there is a new option called the B-Corporation the Benefit Corporation. The Benefit Corporation became an option in 2010 when Maryland’s legislature signed it into law. Subsequently nearly twenty states have followed suit including California and Delaware. In the past four years more than 1000 companies have become B-Corporations including some very well known brands in technology and consumer goods: Warby Parker Patagonia Seventh Generation Method Soaps Etsy New Belgium Brewery Ben & Jerry’s among others. In addition to maximizing shareholder value the goal of nearly all corporations Benefit Corporations strive to impact society and the environment in a positive way. The charter of a B-Corp dictates the board of directors must consider the best interests of the corporation and the effects of its decisions on the company’s workforce its customers community and societal factors and the environment. While many S-Corps C-Corps and LLCs commit to social missions the vigor with which they pursue these missions can wane. Additionally there is no process or standard by which to judge the company’s progress. In contrast B-Corporations cannot waver. B-Corps must elect a Benefits Director who is responsible for ensuring the social mission of the company is balanced with the financial mission. The Benefit Director must solicit an annual audit performed by a third-party. If the board fails to direct the company properly shareholders of a B-Corporation can sue the company. I like the idea of committing to a set of important values in the company charter particularly for mission driven companies. Because I wasn’t familiar with B-Corps before reading Surowiecki’s post and because I haven’t worked with a B-Corp I don’t yet know the intricacies of the structure or the challenges that may arise from it. If you’re considering a B-Corp I suggest consulting an attorney to understand the implications in more depth. But on the surface the B-Corp structure seems to be a powerful way for founders to irrevocably imbue a company with a social mission. Because new directors who may be investors or independents must adhere to the charter the B-Corp ensures the core company values the same ones a business was founded to promote become a permanent fixture of the way the company does business.

http://tomtunguz.com/earning-your-seat/,Deserve is a Toxic Word,Deserve is a Toxic Word Deserve is a toxic word. During my junior year in college I trained like crazy to make the varsity boat on the crew team. Two workouts per day for six days a week during the four week Christmas holiday and on through winter training. That winter I set a personal record for a 2000m sprint. In April we left for Georgia and Augusta River for spring training where our coach seat raced the team to decide the varsity lineup. We spent 10 days seat racing. Two boats would race for four minutes stop switch two people turn around do it again so coach could observe the delta. After the last switch I felt elated when my name was called out on the varsity squad. But I didn’t race as a varsity oarsman that year. I spent the few weeks following spring training soothing tendinitis in my wrists not attending practice and not working out. I thought I deserved my seat. When I finally made it back into a boat it was clear I was slowing the team down. I had lost my speed. Coach pulled me aside and told me I was cut from the varsity. Whenever I start a sentence with the words I deserve I remember the run from the boathouse up the hill to my dorm with my anger hubris and disappointment hanging around my neck. I don’t deserve anything. I have to earn my seat every day. Published 2013-10-03,Published 2013-10-03

They make something complex look effortless. Great athletes are the same. So are great dancers. And even great entrepreneurs. The secret within this aphorism is that success is a grind. It is hard work. It’s easier to let it all hang out for others to see how hard work can be. Often we want others to understand how challenging a problem was to solve or how stressful a deal was to close or how complex a product is. But the people and products who capture our imaginations are the ones who grind like everyone else but remain placid on the surface. These are the graceful ones - the ducks. They make the grind disappear and the results of their work seem effortless as a result. Published 2012-11-19,Published 2012-11-19
http://tomtunguz.com/back-to-fundamentals/,Email and meetings aren’t work,Email and meetings aren’t work Email and most meetings aren’t work. We all know this to be true. But huge swaths of our days are allocated to meetings and answering email. It’s impossible to accomplish much aside from information dissemination. A close friend who like me is a productivity nut asked me a question that made this point clearly: What fraction of your day is spent in meetings you asked for compared to meetings that were asked of you? I didn’t know the answer but I calculated it. I was disheartened by the result. Over the past three weeks my ratio is 6 to 4. For every 6 minutes I spend in a meeting I arranged I spent 4 in a meeting I was invited to. What is your ratio? And what should it be? Presuming meetings I request are more productive than meetings I’m invited to (because I’m driving the agenda and accomplishing my goals) if I could shift that ratio by just one minute to 7 to 3 I would improve my productivity by 17%. The bigger the company the worse the problem becomes. Last week I chatted with a friend who joined had just joined a large company. He found his team to be incredibly unproductive even though his reports were smart. After he asked the team to their tasks in 30 minute blocks he realized 6 of every 8 hours of their days were spent either responding to emails to attending irrelevant meetings. In other words it took four employees to accomplish the work of one focused worker. With the new year around the corner it’s that time to make New Year’s Resolutions. My theme in 2013 is “return to fundamentals.” Set objectives and key results by quarter. These are clear goals with quantifiable metrics. For example spending 50% of my time helping portfolio companies. Block the time every week on my calendar to achieving these goals. Control my calendar to make sure I’m maximizing my meeting ratio (as mentioned above). Prepare for meetings. Send agendas with precise questions agendas and rough timings for each item ahead of time. Measure and tune. I’m going to track these time allocation metrics and my productivity goals. I hope to improve my focus and have a more positive impact with my teams. Email and meetings consume big chunks of time. And though it’s easy to convince ourselves they’re productive they aren’t. It’s hard work that moves companies forward. Time to get back to fundamentals. Published 2012-12-17,Published 2012-12-17
http://tomtunguz.com/atlassian-s-1/,Benchmarking Atlassian's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking Atlassian's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up Founded in 2002 the Australian software maker Atlassian is an exceptional company in many regards. But foremost Atlassian is one of the best examples of flywheel SaaS companies yet. Atlassian counts 1600 employees and sells five products JIRA (bug tracking software) Confluence (project management) HipChat (internal chat/collaboration) BitBucket (code repository) and JIRA Service Desk (help desk software. Yesterday Atlassian filed their F-1 a document preceding their IPO and revealed how efficient a software company they have built. In 2015 the company will generate $320M in revenue. The chart above details the revenue growth of the business compared to the median of the 50+ publicly traded SaaS companies. It follows a beautiful geometric curve characteristic of Flywheel business models where an efficient customer acquisition engine keeps building momentum and growing revenues exceptionally. Note only the last 3 years of revenue are found in the F-1. The rest of the data points I gathered from press about Atlassian. Atlassian’s average customer generates revenue of $5594 per year which places it among companies like Zendesk LogMeIn ConstantContact and Xero in the smallest quartile. Atlassian has grown their customer base from 11000 customers in 2010 to more than 48000 today. Though Atlassian counts more than half of the Fortune 500 as customers no single customer accounts for more than 1% of revenue. In other words no single client pays Atlassian more than $3.5M. And only 864 customers pay more than $50k per year. Perhaps the most impressive part of Atlassian’s business is their go-to-market efficiency. While the median SaaS company spends between 50-100% of their annual revenue on sales and marketing Atlassian has spent between 12 and 21% of their revenue on customer acquisition in the last three years. These metrics simply unheard of. They also imply a sales efficiency normally in the 0.8-1.2 range of 2.5 to 3.2. The data makes clear that Atlassian employs a fundamentally different go-to-market than the classic sales development rep to inside sales model championed by books like Predictable Revenue and popularized by Salesforce. This flywheel model uses the product and analytics to attract customers and upgrade them into higher paying tiers. As a consequence of immense sales efficiency Atlassian is profitable - a rarity in today’s software companies. Atlassian’s net income as a percentage of revenue has been positive the last three years: 7.2% 8.8% and 2.1%. In addition Atlassian generates cash flow of between 15-18% of revenue. This cash in addition to a small amount of venture capital has provided the wherewithal to fuel the business’s growth. In 2015 Atlassian will generate more than $65M in free cash flow. Atlassian operates at 83.4% gross margin 12 percentage points above the SaaS median of 70.9%. Atlassian spends aggressively in research and development investing more than 40% of revenues of late into improving their products optimizing the funnels which fuels the growth of the flywheel model. Atlassian surpassed the $50M revenue mark seven years after founding in 2009 similar to Hubspot DemandWare NewRelic and other great companies. Compared to the typical SaaS company Atlassian has growth at roughly the median growth rate over the past 8 years. Forward Revenue Multiple Enterprise Value $B 7.7x $3.6 9.0x $4.2 10.5x $4.8 11.5x $5.3 What will Atlassian be worth in the public markets? If we project the company to grow at 45% in 2016 a similar growth rate to 2015 then revenues will total about $460M. Atlassian should command a premium multiple. 7.7x forward revenues is the top quartile median implying a $3.6B market cap. Workday and ServiceNow trade at 10.5x. And Xero trades at 11.5x which is the best forward multiple as of Friday which would imply a valuation of $5.3B. If nothing else Atlassian is existence proof an exceptional business can come from anywhere. It’s a unique flywheel business with best-in-class sales efficiency. Every SaaS founder should study this business to understand the model. It’s a case study in sales efficiency. Published 2015-11-10,Published 2015-11-10
http://tomtunguz.com/android-vs-ios/,Mobile OS trends in five charts,Mobile OS trends in five charts In May 2010 I bet a good friend of mine that Android would overtake iOS in total devices shipments in 12 months' time. My prediction was completely off the mark. In May 2011 iOS led cumulative shipments by more than 100%: 191M to 95M. It would take another 10 months for Android to equal Apple in March 2011 at about 325M each. Race to one billion devices But Android reached this milestone in a way I didn’t anticipate. I expected a clean division between the high and low ends of the market along OS lines. Apple starts up-market and discounts for the down-market Surprisingly Android has been competing successfully at the high end. The Samsung Galaxy line has sold tens of millions of units. So have the Motorola Droid phones which have similar price points to the iPhone. And Apple has been discounting older models of their devices to to win the low end of the market. In fact Apple has a mobile product at every $50 price point between $0 and $850. The lion’s share of profits As Android wins the market share war commanding 75% market share of devices Apple reaps 71% of mobile hardware profits. And those margins are increasing as the company drives leverages economies of scale. Android’s lead will continue to grow Despite this pricing strategy Android has surpassed iOS in devices - a change that will likely never be reversed because Android activations continue to grow at a faster monthly growth rate than iOS even as Android’s device activation count increases. Potential for huge growth in Android tablets despite slow start Tablets are a key growth factor for Android - a form factor I worried would be a challenge for the OS. 40% of Apple’s mobile devices activated in Q3 were tablets. Should this ratio hold for Android then there could be a 4x upside in Android tablet shipments. A battle on many fronts The end result is the same as many forecasted: Android has become the market share leader and Apple has won the lion’s share of profits. But the path has been much more nuanced than I expected. Published 2012-11-05,Published 2012-11-05
http://tomtunguz.com/forty-seven-year-prediction/,A 47 Year Old Prediction Comes True,A 47 Year Old Prediction Comes True On January 8 1966 the New Yorker profiled Buckminster Fuller for the first time. During a trip to a Maine island with the journalist Calvin Tomkins Fuller said something tremendously prescient: Fuller proposed a worldwide technological revolution…[that] would take place quite independently of politics or ideology; it would be carried out by what he calls “comprehensive designers” who would coordinate resources and technology on a world scale for the benefit of all mankind and would constantly anticipate future needs while they found ever-better ways of providing more and more from less and less. Fuller’s prediction has come true. The founders of the tech companies embody the values of the comprehensive designers and enact the changes Fuller predicted. From Google investing $100M behind Calico a life extension research company to Khan Academy which extends high-quality education into the hands of hundreds of millions of people to Twitter which has become the mouthpiece of revolutions and countless others to SpaceX which has dramatically decreased the cost of space transport to Oxford Nanopore which sequences DNA on a chip the size of a USB drive these products and the comprehensive designers behind them have benefitted mankind tremendously. The most important part of the quote for me is the last phrase: the constant improvement and reinvention. That’s what makes technology so exciting. Industries are constantly under threat of disruption innovation and change. Welcome to the era of the comprehensive designer. Published 2013-12-13,Published 2013-12-13
http://tomtunguz.com/the-hardware-ma-market-will-be-vibrant-in-2013/,The startup hardware M&A market will be vibrant in 2013,The startup hardware M&A market will be vibrant in 2013 Hardware competition is cut-throat. Walking through the halls of CES every Android phone is identical. LG has copied each Samsung model. Because of the competition tablet prices are plummeting - I saw a $49 7inch tablet (and some were giving Nexus 7s away for free with subscription. Not constrained to large competitors startups like FitBit and Jawbone launched competing (and nearly identical) products within weeks of each other: the FitBit Flex and the Jawbone Up Even newer segments like gesture control of TVs or GoPro self-recording cameras are addressed by six competitors many of them white-label. Software has become the differentiator for all these devices because the hardware is indistinguishable to all but the geekiest. In other words it’s all about the experience - a concept Apple has championed for almost three decades to great recent success. Unfortunately many equipment manufacturers lack the skill set to develop compelling software. For example Belkin’s wifi-enabled plugtop “actually makes your house worse” Even the software of the market leader Apple is be terrible: “iTunes should die” “iOS6 Maps is Awful” and as Bijan wrote every one of the core iOS apps has been replaced with third party software As these OEMs face the challenge of building great software they must choose among three options: 1. Accept - Co-opt open source software like Android and deploy a commodity 2. Ignore - Contract the development to an agency 3. Embrace - Build a software design competency in-house Clearly the market winners will pursue the last option. Some OEMs may be able to build teams on their own like Samsung. But the majority of manufacturers will look to acquire software design talent to differentiate their commodity hardware products. The return of venture backed hardware startups has engendered a community of companies who have successfully unified talents in hardware and software design: Nest FitBit Electric Imp Jawbone Sonos Basis Leap Motion Boxee and many more. Crowdfunding has also been a healthy supplier of capital to hybrid companies like Ouya and Pebble among others. Hardware industrial design is no longer a sufficient differentiator for manufacturers. The winners in the next decade will fuse spectacular software design with better but commodity hardware. The fastest path to that end for incumbents is acquisition of startups like these.

http://tomtunguz.com/mobileiron-s-1/,Benchmarking MobileIron's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking MobileIron's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Founded in 2007 MobileIron is a leader in the Mobile Device Management sector. MDM provides enterprises software to manage the mobile phones and tablets of their employees. MobileIron provides three different products: a server product called Core to define and deploy security policies a client product named Client that enforces these policies on each device and a gateway called Sentry that secures traffic from the device to the enterprise’s servers. MobileIron employs a hybrid delivery model. The company delivers its product both as perpetual license software and as-a-Service. We will explore the differences in these delivery models and the implications for the business. MobileIron went public on Jun 12 2014 with $100M in revenue and more than 6000 customers. In the next seven or so charts we’ll explore how MobileIron built their business using data from their S-1. We will explore revenue growth average revenue per customer sales efficiency payback periods net income gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots I’ve used MobileIron colors as a consistent legend. MobileIron company data is brick red median values are black and other company values from a basket of about 40 publicly traded SaaS companies are gray. MobileIron recorded $105M in trailing twelve months’ revenue up from $13.8M just two years before. The company has grown faster than the median SaaS business in our benchmark data set recording a 176% CAGR over this three year period compared. The median company grew by 115% from years 4 to 6 from founding. As I mentioned above MobileIron is a hybrid business combining both perpetual license and SaaS models. The chart above shows the revenue contribution by product: Perpetual License SaaS and Services & Support. In large gray numbers I’ve marked the CAGR for these three years. Two trends surface from the data. First all lines of business are growing very well and faster than the median SaaS company. Second Perpetual Licenses form the bulk of the company’s business. Third the SaaS product has been growing the fastest on an annualized basis over the past three years. Let’s cut the data in a different way and evaluate the share of revenue contribution by product. The Perpetual License in red accounts for 66% of revenues a fraction that has remained constant over the past two years. Service & Support in green generates about 20% of revenues but the share is falling. And SaaS in blue accounts for 13-14% of revenues and is increasing slightly. In short MobileIron still is primarily a software licensing plus support revenue model with a SaaS product added to service a small fraction of the customer revenue base. Which of these products is the most attractive for Mobile Iron to sell? First let’s review MobileIron’s overall gross margin which has increased from 62% to 84% in the past three years easily surpassing the median of 49% to 60%. As the business has scaled MobileIron’s gross margin is increasing by 16% per year a dramatic climb. This increase in gross margin is driven by all three products as the chart above shows. I’ve plotted the gross margin by product over time. The Perpetual License product as we saw in the Tableau S-1 analysis has very high (95%+) gross margin because the cost of the revenue is small. Customers buy the software and deploy it on their own hardware so there are no ongoing costs of revenue. In addition I suspect nearly all customers buy Support & Service alongside their Perpetual License product so the account management and customer support costs are borne by the customer. It’s interesting to note that Support and Service operated at a negative gross margin in 2011 meaning the business was losing money for each dollar of services they sold. This could be for many different reasons. The sales team may have decided to do this in order to increase sales velocity mitigate complexity in the set-up of the product or perhaps this team was overstaffed relative to the business coming in. It’s difficult to know for sure. The SaaS business’ gross margins have improved dramatically over the past three years more than tripling. This is likely because the infrastructure costs (servers hosting bandwidth operations teams) required to operate the SaaS product are being amortized over a growing customer base. MobileIron runs their SaaS operation at about 76% gross margin which is substantially better than the median SaaS gross margin of 61% in year six. Compared to the benchmark set MobileIron has historically burned more cash and operated at greater negative income than the median. But in the last two years the company has made great strides towards profitability and reduced its Net Income as a % of Revenue from -184% to -31%. This reduction in burn has accompanied an amazing revenue growth. MobileIron’s sales efficiency is on the rise. The business now exceeds a sales efficiency of 1.3 meaning one dollar invested in sales and marketing returns $1.30 in revenue in the next year. Given this terrific sales efficiency it stands to reason the company would invest significantly in growth and the Sales and Marketing Spend as a % of Revenue. MobileIron spent the most of any company in the benchmark set as a percentage of revenue in year 4 at 166% of revenue. But over the past few years the company has been approaching the median rapidly. As a product of great sales efficiency and heavy sales investment MobileIron has reached $50M in revenue among the top 10 fastest companies. Interestingly MobileIron’s R&D spend is significantly above the median. In years 4 and 5 the company spent close to sixty percent of its revenue the third most of any company in the benchmark set. In year six (2013) that ratio has fallen but still remains ten percentage points above the six year median of 23%. I’m not sure why this is. It could have to do with the volume of integrations required by such a centralized piece of software. Or the increasing competition in the market place may have also driven heavier investment to differentiate the product. Or it might be something else. MobileIron has been able to accomplish this phenomenal revenue growth with an average revenue per customer (ARPC) of about $17600 a price point which comfortably supports an inside sales model. MobileIron is an impressive business with terrific revenue growth and is a good example of a hybrid Perpetual License and SaaS business. Published 2014-09-30,Published 2014-09-30
http://tomtunguz.com/marketing-capital-at-risk/,The Riskiest Investment a Startup Can Make,The Riskiest Investment a Startup Can Make Marketing investments are unlike any other investment a startup. They are the least-tangible least-measurable investments and that’s why they are perceived as the riskiest investments. After raising a round of capital a startup’s management team has a pool of capital to invest. They can choose from different projects: growing the engineering team to build products faster spending more on infrastructure to speed page load times moving to a bigger office adding salespeople to prospect more customers. All of the aforementioned products have long-term value and the benefit of the investment can be seen immediately. New hires are in the office every day and will remain with the company for years. The speed benefits of faster infrastructure accrue to the company daily and a better product engenders a happier customer base. But marketing spend is different. A dollar spent to distribute a marketing campaign may buy ad impressions that the company never sees At Google we ran into this problem often. An AdWords advertiser would call their salesperson and say “We spent $50k on AdSense last month but our CEO couldn’t find our ad. Can you send me a screenshot of the ad running on the placements we bought?” Those CEOs were searching for tangibility beyond the impression and click reports offered in the AdWords UI. Their dollar had vanished so they thought unlike the new salesperson making calls a few feet away from the CEO’s desk. On top of this if you believe the tired aphorism that half of marketing dollars are wasted but no one knows which half then the odds of making money with marketing spend is about the same as playing a hand in BlackJack. Like a scratched off lottery ticket I could argue residual value of a marketing campaign is often zero or very close to zero. Poof! Once spent the dollar is gone. Of course that’s probably too strong a statement. A performance marketing campaign can generate leads for the sales team to close and a content marketing campaign can increase brand awareness or a brand advertising campaign can improve the brand’s perception and thereby increase the value of the brand. The challenge with the latter two examples is the lack of tangibility or method to measure it which is at the core of what makes marketing investments unique and challenging. And the challenge with performance marketing is the attribution problem: which of the seven ad units the customer saw actually triggered them to buy our product? The first the six in-between and/or the last one? Yesterday I spoke with a sophisticated marketer and she mentioned a marketing concept that was new to me called ROMO or Return on Marketing Objectives. In addition to a pure return on investment (ROI) calculation ROMO includes measurements of changes in brand equity value Net-Promoter Score and brand-recall metrics to measure the impact of a marketing dollar. Broadening out the way to measure of marketing spend makes sense to me because it helps articulate more of the value of a dollar of marketing spend. After all intuitively we know Superbowl ads increase brand awareness which can be incredibly valuable even if the ads don’t immediately increase sales. I’m not sure if we will ever get to point where we can truly quantify marketing and eliminate the risks startups face in spending marketing dollars. Understanding the chemistry between an ad unit or a blog post or a tweet and a prospective customer may be too difficult or simply impossible to measure for certain types of marketing spend. Finding ways of getting a sense of marketing impact like ROMO may be helpful in the meantime though to describe some of the broader impacts of a dollar of marketing spend.

http://tomtunguz.com/storytelling-duarte/,The Three Frameworks You Need to Create Powerful Presentations and Tell Compelling Stories,The Three Frameworks You Need to Create Powerful Presentations and Tell Compelling Stories I remember many the great TED talks I’ve watched. Sir Ken Robinson’s “How Schools Kill Creativity” and the story of a little girl whose genius was unrecognized in school until she was allow do dance and ultimately became a prima-ballerina is simply unforgettable. In most of my meetings I remember Amy Cuddy’s “Body Language” talk for a split-second. Commanding her body language changed her career. And who can forget Steve Jobs announcement of the iPhone? Presentations can be incredibly persuasive and particularly in business whether for closing candidates pitching investors to fund raise interviewing with the press and so on they can materially impact the course of a startup. But it’s really hard to tell a good story. Most of us have never studied the craft of constructing a story: how to draw the arc of the storyline how to elicit emotions with dramatic tension or how to entice the audience into conspiring with us in the plot. The best book I’ve found on building compelling presentations is Nancy Duarte’ Resonate. In Resonate Nancy explains the three different key components of memorable effective pitches: the journey the speaker would like the audience to traverse the framework for creating a good story and the mechanism to bring the two together. Duarte argues a successful presenter convinces the audience to believe in a new idea. To achieve this goal the presenter must deliver a compelling story that paints the ordinary world of today and contrasts it with the special world of the future. The presenter must call the audience to embark on the adventure handle their immediate objections to this invitation and then establish the presenter as the mentor through the process. Those are the first four steps of the Audience’s Journey. The diagram above shows the remainder of the twelve steps through which a great presenter leads her audience. If this feels familiar it should. This journey forms the arc of every great story. To prove the point Duarte diagrammed the audience’s journey with Luke Skywalker in Star Wars and the book has many similar examples. Next the book introduces us to the story template which is a MadLibs-style fill-in-the-blank for crafting the arc of the story. This template follows the Situation Complication Question and Answer philosophy and demands simplification of the storyline. As Duarte writes in her book complexity kills presentations. Last Duarte combines synthesizes the output of these two frameworks into a spark line like the one above for the iPhone announcement by Steve Jobs. Time is demarcated along the x-axis. Along the y-axis the spark line shows whether the presenter is talking about the present or the future. Along the bottom Duarte has noted when the audience claps and laughs and when Jobs marvels at his own product. The relationship between these four time series shows how well Jobs is able to convince the audience to see his vision and share his wonder for this product. Spark lines can be great planning tools as well as great feedback loops to improve presentations. Great pitches oscillate between between what is and what could be. Duarte shares similar spark lines for Richard Feynman physicist extraordinaire and his lecture on gravity and Benjamin Zander conductor of the Boston Philharmonic and his TED talk on music among others. In her book Duarte dissects other great speeches including Martin Luther King’s “I Have A Dream” and Ronald Reagan’s Challenger Disaster announcement. The best presenters contrast the present and the future throughout the presentation and when down successfully this seesawing drives the audience t o believe the presenter’s vision. Resonate is a powerful book because it reveals all the tricks of the magician presenters and shares the tools to craft compelling memorable and trajectory-changing stories.

http://tomtunguz.com/visualization/,The Future of Human Data Interaction,The Future of Human Data Interaction On the day of Tableau’s IPO a company known for innovating in data visualization I thought I would share the most impressive HCI concept I’ve seen in a long time. In my view Bret Victor is on the forefront of human computer interaction design. In the first two or three minutes of this video at Stanford he demonstrates his home-built software that combines data analysis with visualization. It’s magnificent and really hard to describe because it’s so novel. Drawing Dynamic Visualizations from Bret Victor on Vimeo. Victor uses words to create and manipulate the drawing and it all seems so natural and fluid. The interaction with the software parallels a conversation between two designers over a piece of paper - which is exactly the kind of interaction that makes software seem human and natural. I hope we see an explosion of these types of tools in the future. Have you seen other great examples of human computer interaction? Let me know on Twitter about them.

http://tomtunguz.com/state-of-the-venture-market/,How the Fund Raising Market Will Evolve in 2014,How the Fund Raising Market Will Evolve in 2014 Fenwick’s report on the state of the venture market and I came across these three data points that summarise one facet of the market in Silicon Valley succinctly: 11 venture backed companies raised funds at a valuation of over $1 billion in Q114 more than did so in all of 2013. Hedge and mutual funds participated in 23 venture deals through mid-April compared to 41 in all of 2013 Investment in later stage comprised 47% of all dollars invested in Q1 while Series A investment fell to a five quarter low at 15%. The late stage venture market has been booming spectacularly in Silicon Valley. This source of capital enabling companies to remain private longer and become larger before an IPO or sale. After reading the report I became curious about the trends in the US broadly so I ran three quick analyses on Crunchbase data. First the median investment sizes by round are relatively constant for the earlier rounds (angel series-a series-b). But Series C+ have seen a steady growth over the past 8 years. This indicates the growth in the size of later rounds has been broadly felt. Second as a share of the total venture dollars raised growth rounds have been growing nearly monotonically pushing the Series A and Series B share below 20% each. This implies that the lion’s share of venture dollars and in particular the newer larger funds are invested in growth rounds. If the fundraising trends in Q1 continue for the year VCs will raise twice as much capital in 2014 as 2013 ($36B vs $17B). The majority of those dollars will pursue late stage pre-IPO opportunities rather than bolster the early stage market provided the private market remain relatively insulated from the correcting consumer and enterprise companies in the public market. Third geographic concentration seems to be increasing. San Francisco has seen a meteoric rise of share of venture dollars invested growing from less than 10% to more than 20% last year. Curiously Palo Alto’s share has skyrocketed driven by one investment in particular: the Cloudera $750M round. So the recent decline in SF’s share of dollars seems to be an aberration. New York has also been growing steadily. The venture market is changing rapidly. Mega-rounds are now part of the modern venture landscape. Geographic concentrations are shifting. Startups are becoming larger and larger. I suspect there will be a retrenchment in later stage investments both in the Bay Area and across the US more broadly. It’s still unclear to me how this growth investment market correction will impact earlier stage investments. Most of the Q1 data predates the February public market correction. Q2 will be an important bellwether to gauge the bullishness of the venture industry for 2014. Published 2014-05-19,Published 2014-05-19

Products break deadlines are missed legal issues arise customers raise issue employees quit bad press circulates. To survive founders and management teams have to respond well and quickly. In Managing the Unexpected two University of Michigan Professors examine the characteristics and behaviors of great teams during crisis. Factory workers miners fire fighters aircraft carrier flight deck hands railroad operators and many others. The authors call these teams HROs for High Reliability Organizations. HROs are distinguished by an ability to handle novel risky situations. HROs combine distinct values and a certain type of leadership. At their core all of these teams embody mindfulness means five things: Preoccupation with failure - a burning desire to learn from mistakes to prevent future ones. Reluctance to simplify interpretations - employing brutal intellectual honesty in their cultures. Sensitivity to crisis - being ready to identify and respond to a crisis. Commitment to resilience - building a team that is excited to handle and bounce back from crisis. Deference to expertise - respect insights about the business from “experts” within the irrespective of their seniority or lack thereof. These are great values for startups to inculcate in their cultures and hiring processes. Startup company building means rapid product and business experimentation. Moving that fast means the team is bound to break things. The company must be built to absorb react recover and learn. One of my favorite anecdotes from the book is this one about Churchill: During World War II Churchill made the horrifying discovery that Singapore was far less impregnable than he thought and was actually highly vulnerable to a Japanese land invasion. Reflecting on this unexpected discovery Churchill commented in his history tory of the war “I ought to have known. My advisors ought to have known and I ought to have been told and I ought to have asked.”’ Mindfulness means anticipating crisis opening up the channels of communication from every part of the company to gather expertise understanding the causes of the crisis in all their complexity committing to resolving the crisis and learning from it.

Founders are an adventurous breed. They undertake the substantial risk of starting a company to solving a problem and improving the world in some way. Underpinning each founder’s decision to start a company is passion. Sometimes a founder’s passion is innate sometimes it is discovered sometimes it is cultivated. Ultimately it doesn’t matter how passion comes about. All that matters is that passion is present and growing. That’s what we are all chasing. Published 2012-10-02,Published 2012-10-02
http://tomtunguz.com/anatomy-of-a-customer-reference/,8 Customer Discovery Questions to Validate Product Market Fit for Your Startup,8 Customer Discovery Questions to Validate Product Market Fit for Your Startup When I was a PM at Google we conducted customer research often to understand our customers’ opinions on AdSense. In 2005 Google Yahoo and Microsoft were vying to win dominant share of advertising pages across large publishers. Customer knowledge both quantitative and quantitative informed product development and that research became a key part of AdSense’s success. A few years later when I joined Redpoint I learned that venture capitalists perform similar customer research during diligence. While the ultimate use of the data might differ the actual investigations and interviews are remarkably alike. During a typical diligence process we will interview customers and might ask them questions like these: How did you hear about the product? We’re looking to understand what customer acquisition mechanisms are working for the company and if they are consistent with the company’s perceptions. What process did you use to pick this product over the competition? This question sheds light into the sales process most notably the key stakeholders and the ultimate decision-maker and also sales cycle length. Why did you choose this product? I’m digging for product differentiation and to understand if there are different customer segments in the market who might use a different product to satisfy unique needs. Which teams in the company use the product and how has that changed over time? This inquiry reveals the key users the potential for account growth and negative churn possibility. How important is this product compared to other software? Validate that in the words of Paul Graham this is a hair-on-fire problem. If it’s not in the top 5 most important needs sales cycles will lag because no internal champions will promote it and budget will be difficult to secure. How much do you pay? Is it worth more or less than X product? Ascertain whether the customer believes the return on investment is wildly in their favor. Also I’m determining whether the company is successfully matching their branding with their price point with a relative pricing question. A premium product should be priced that way and be marketed as such. How quickly is the product evolving? How satisfied are you with customer support and working with the company? Both of these questions indicate churn risk. Fast evolving products with great customer support convey to users that the startup cares about delighting them. It’s also a great diagnostic tool for exposing overselling. Do the salespeople in the company overpromise to attain quota only for the product to disappoint later on? To whom would you recommend this product? This question aims to understand the breadth of potential customers the product can serve and the vigor with which an existing customer would recommend. It’s a qualitative proxy for market size eg “Everybody vs real estate startups based in Wisconsin.” All of these questions are customer and product discovery questions almost identical to the ones product managers use to understand if the company has unlocked product-market fit. In addition these interviews surface insights about marketing positioning and true perception in the market; customer support effectiveness; overselling; and product importance. It shouldn’t be a surprise that potential investors also use them to understand fit. Published 2015-10-08,Published 2015-10-08
http://tomtunguz.com/the-most-underrated-startup-member/,The Most Under-Appreciated Startup Team Member,The Most Under-Appreciated Startup Team Member The reason most startups go out of business is they run out of money. The CEO bears the responsibility for raising money managing those assets and growing the business into profitability and ultimate sustainability. But the CEO shouldn’t bear this load alone. To help defray that critical responsibility the CEO ought to have a consigliere an advisor who helps plan allocate resources and illuminate the trade-offs between decisions. That consigliere is the head of finance and the most under-appreciated startup team member. In my experience there is a remarkable difference in the management discipline and organization between companies who have built a finance team and those who haven’t. Typically I recommend hiring a head of finance right after the Series A or when the team reaches about 10 to 15 people. At that point the company undergoes an increase in financial complexity having to deal with 409A valuations auditing producing financial statements for investors real estate decisions and so on. In addition to tactical help the head of finance is responsible for expressing the long-term vision of the company in numbers which is as important in the early stages of the business as during the roadshow for your IPO. A startup’s financial statements are the most succinct expression of the company’s intentions and goals and strategy. Like a battlefield map financial statements lay out a strategy for a company. They detail the requirements necessary to ensure the business succeeds including the revenue model the sales cycle hiring plan cash burn and all of the assumptions underpinning the strategy. Best of all financial analysis clearly expresses the trade-offs made by different prioritizations. Scenario planning becomes concrete: if we hire two more salespeople we can’t afford to hire two more engineers which would delay the product by three months but increase revenue in the short term and potentially put us in a better position to raise a follow on financing. Which is the right decision? Those kinds of strategic questions arise often for startups particularly those undergoing fast growth or operating in competitive markets. In these situations having strong head of finance can be the difference between success or failure. Financial planning is all about ensuring the company has all the resources it needs to accomplish its goals and that’s priority number one for every startup.

http://tomtunguz.com/how-i-would-raise/,Building auction pressure in financings,Building auction pressure in financings The most effective financing processes like the most effective auctions create scarcity. Of late many founders have been triggering pre-emptive financing processes for their raises. This is my interpretation of their playbook. Strategy First founders build credibility with investors. This can be done in many ways like cultivating a long term relationship with a handful of VCs or in less direct ways like brand building through social media and blogging. Founders have established credibility through referrals from people-in-common. And of course business performance is the trump card. Walk in with great numbers and you establish your company as an expert. Second founders create the perception of scarcity a great tool to seduce investors. There are many forms of scarcity creation. Trailing a fast moving processes is the most common form of scarcity I’ve observed. Once one investor is engaged it’s much easier to engage others; ie “We weren’t raising but someone became really excited and now you’re behind the process. Should we meet?” Gameplan How does a team build that momentum? One common gameplan: About 3 months before a fund raise founders call a handful of VCs to provide an update on the business and indicate the company is contemplating a fund raising in about 3 to 6 months. They typically ask for advice on the process. What kinds of metrics and milestones excite investors enough to invest? What questions do they foresee their partners asking? What challenges to the business exist that the pitch must address? A month or two or three later founders follow up with an update to explain the progress on the key questions investors raised with the goal of triggering a meeting before the official process begins. By asking for expectations and then beating them founders establish the business’s momentum and reaffirm credibility with an investor. With the first meeting down and others in the pipeline it’s a race to the finish with the goal of getting to term sheets and closing as fast as possible. Every once in a while a business is growing so quickly or is just such a wonderful idea that no effort is required on the part of the company and investors pursue pre-emptive rounds actively. In that case this playbook is moot. Pros and Cons There are many advantages to entice investors to engage early. Startups aren’t expected to have prepared as many materials as those engaging in a “formal” process. An early process has the potential to eliminate financing risk much earlier than expected. Founders can steer the financing to investors of their choice with more control than a standard process. And founders can always point to the pre-emptive nature of the financing as a bargaining tool for better terms. The most common refrain is effective: “You can invest now and get a bargain or I can raise in 6 months at a much higher price as my business continues to grow.” Of course there are trade-offs. First like any financing these processes are time expensive. Second if the process takes too long to engage any investors it can be perceived as a failed financing so timing perceptions must be actively managed. Third it may not work. Investors may not be receptive because of seasonality (summer doldrums) or macro-economic factors or business risks/stage. Like Mentos and Diet Coke Preemptive financings don’t happen for every company but when they do it can be well worth the effort. Published 2012-09-03,Published 2012-09-03
http://tomtunguz.com/redshift/,The Technology that's Taking Data Science by Storm,The Technology that's Taking Data Science by Storm Given all the momentum of the NoSQL movement it would be easy to write off SQL-based technologies as forgotten or simply standing still. But there’s a tremendous amount of innovation occurring in SQL databases. Amazon’s Redshift an elastic data-warehousing solution launched in late 2012 is the most salient example. Redshift’s ability to process huge volumes of data is breathtaking. When running Redshift on solid state drives (SSDs) one team at FlyData queried 1 terabyte of data in less than 10 seconds. AirBnB’s data science team wrote about their experiences contrasting Redshift and Hive. They found Redshift to be 20x faster at 25% the cost. Aggregate Knowledge shared their story of searching for a database system that permits linear scaling and quick access to same day data with Redshift Although Redshift adoption is still much smaller than other data-warehousing technologies consider Github has 96 Redshift repositories compared to close to 1200 for Hive; and although Redshift is missing some important data processing features the benefits of a cloud-based data-warehouse with familiar SQL syntax and tremendous speed will make Redshift the data-warehouse of choice for many analytics teams. The rise of Redshift creates opportunities for startups to create valuable products atop the cloud-based data-warehouse. First it speeds product trial and adoption. For example potential customers examining Looker’s product simply need to provision access to their Redshift instance to give it a whirl. Second Redshift enables startups to focus on innovating in better design application-level innovation and delivering insight rather than the infrastructure of data analysis. Redshift is a boon for analysts and data scientists who will benefit from the speed cost and scalability of the system. In addition the next-generation of data science startups will profit from the accelerated product adoption and sales models afforded by Redshift’s delivery model.

http://tomtunguz.com/orbiting-the-hairball/,A Very Unusual Book about Startup Culture,A Very Unusual Book about Startup Culture Orbiting the Giant Hairball is one of the most unusual business books I’ve read. It’s irreverent full of drawings and completely chaotic in the most wonderful way. Gordon MacKenzie the author of the book worked at Hallmark cards for 30 years to the day. He started initially in the creative department imagining greeting cards and ultimately found himself with the title Creative Paradox. In his book he described the way he injected creativity into his working life. I thought it was a great book with three salient themes. The book’s unforgettable title may be the only one in the business section of the bookstore with the word hairball. Gordon contends that all companies are hairballs. Each person each problem each process adds to the hairball and creates a gravity a permanence in the way that the company operates. Because it’s such an intertwined thing the hairball impossible to unwind. So in order to succeed in companies he argues we need to operate outside of this hairball. If we orbit the hairball observe how it works but live in our own world then we can be happy and successful. Orbiting means redefining the scope of our jobs and the ways that we accomplish our goals. Hence the title. Creativity is another important topic Gordon explores. Responsible for creating seminars workshops and generally getting people inside Hallmark to expand their mindsets Gordon is a believer in nonlinear thinking. There is an important tension inside of businesses and particularly startups. At the beginning of the company the founders are trying to create something out of chaos and transform non-scalable actions into highly scalable processes. This is an evolution from nonlinear to linear thinking. But it’s important for companies to revert back to nonlinear thinking often; that’s how creativity is born. In a chapter called First There’s Grope Then There’s Rote Gordon describes the way he developed a creativity workshop for the Hallmark management team of the company. Gordon held a three hour session - a chaotic creative tactile environment called “Grope” that challenged people’s notions of work. The first workshop was a huge success. To prepare for the second workshop Gordon used his notes from the first. But the second one failed because it had become a product of the process. it was the same as the first In his words it had become rote linear uncreative. So he reverted to chaos and the success continued. Last Gordon recounts a story about the cultural toxicity of teasing and criticism. When hosting a workshop for team of salespeople he asks everyone in the room to use some crayons and a piece of paper to draw some representation of what they do at work. When a woman in the back of the room decides to share she comes to the front of the room and begins to draw. Immediately members of the audience critique her drawing skills. Gordon contends this kind of criticism is a mechanism to force people to revert to the norm to be like anybody else and is poisonous to creativity. What’s wonderful about this book is that it characterizes the point of view of a cultural iconoclast within a large company. These perspectives stretch the reader’s mind about what culture ought to be and how to break out of the every day in order to engender creativity. It’s not to say that process and prioritization aren’t important - they are critical - but rather they must be balanced. There are no frameworks no best practices just a collection of stories and drawings that articulate thought-provoking points of view. It’s a wonderful book to help founders and “number worshipers” like me rebalance our world-views. Published 2015-05-20,Published 2015-05-20
http://tomtunguz.com/saas-enabled-marketplace-data-advantage/,Data Network Effects in SaaS Enabled Marketplaces,Data Network Effects in SaaS Enabled Marketplaces SaaS Enabled Marketplaces benefit from a unique advantage in their go-to-market. They have a panoptic view of their market place which over time provides them an unassailable competitive advantage. SEMs provide software to suppliers and consumers and then make a market between them. The first SEMs flourished in advertising. Google manages one of the world’s largest advertising market places. They provide software to publishers the supply side which manages available ad inventory with a product called DoubleClick for Publishers or DFP. In addition Google provides the demand-side inventory system AdWords to help advertisers manage their budget. In between Google operates an advertising marketplace AdX. Today there are an increasing number examples of SEMs including StyleSeat (beauty) Zenefits (benefits) Quartzy (lab management) Makeable (manufacturing) Yardbook (landscaping) Joist (construction) among others. Because SEMs deploy SaaS to both the supply side and the demand side these companies can develop an exceptional understanding of their market. Access to supplier data and consumer demand provides four key advantages to SEMs. First SEMs understand the supply/demand curve at every second. They know how many people are planning landscaping projects and how many landscapers might be available in the near future to help with a particular kind of garden design. Consequently if there is a supply/demand imbalance the SEM can acquire more landscapers or more homeowners to balance the market place. Second SEMs understand the operational excellence of their suppliers. Joist can record which contractors complete their projects on schedule and on budget. This data enables the marketplace to amass census scale data on supplier performance granular to the type of service rendered. The SEM can better qualify and match supply and demand. In addition SEMs can recommend to suppliers how to improve their performance e.g. raise the profile of an ad unit for a publisher or offer Brazilian blowouts to a stylist. Third the accumulated data on both consumer demand and supplier performance compounds into a unique data asset that erects a moat around the business. The first successful SEM in a market will recognize the best types of consumers and the best types of suppliers and pursue them before others. This furthers the winner-take-all dynamics of already latent within the market place. Fourth because of the visibility into supply/demand a deep understanding of supplier excellence and the ability to identify the right types of buyers and sellers SEMs benefit from a more efficient go to market. We did this extensively at Google using signals from AdSense to understand which additional publishers and advertisers to acquire. The SEM acquires more sellers when needed and more buyers when needed increasing the efficiency of marketing compared to blind acquisition. This informed acquisition improves the experience for buyers and sellers by maintaining an optimal amount of liquidity in the market place. Once stood up SEMs are powerful forces. Because they instrument both the demand side and the supply side of a market place these businesses accumulate unique data that reinforces the business’s strength.

http://tomtunguz.com/xero-s-1/,Benchmarking Xero's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking Xero's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. There’s a SaaS company on the other side of the world founded nine years ago that is worth $2B generates $100M in annual revenue and growing 80% year over year. Based in New Zealand Xero has built a widely adopted small-to-medium business (SMB) accounting solution that counts 371000 paying customers a figure that grew 76% in the last 12 months. Amazingly 30% of New Zealand GDP is processed by Xero. Xero is an unusual company for two reasons. First Xero is a glowing example of a successful SMB SaaS company. Second Xero became a publicly traded company on the New Zealand exchange very very early on. Consequently nearly all of the company’s data is public. In fact below I’ve copied Xero’s P&L from its first year since founding all the way through 2014 - a data set I never thought I would be able to publish on any company for confidentiality reasons. Xero Income Statement 2007 2008 2009 2010 211 2012 2013 2014 Revenue 0.01 0.306 0.6 2.3 7.1 15.8 32.9 61.9 Growth 109% 265% 206% 123% 107% 88% Gross Profit -0.8 -2.0 -2.3 -3.5 -1.6 0.3 21.2 40.6 SG&A. - 0.3 1.2 2.2 3.3 6.2 25.1 58.6 R & D Exp. - - - - - - 9.7 16.0 Net Income -1.0 -3.4 -3.9 -6.0 -5.7 -6.5 -12.1 -30.8 % of Revenue -611% -257% -80% -41% -37% -50% You can read through Xero’s investor materials on their investor portal and sift through their annual report for 2015 here which reveals that the company acquires SMBs by convincing outsourced accountancies migrate the SMBs these accountancies serve to Xero. And in the US each accountancy provides about 13 SMB customers to Xero. In the next few charts we’ll explore Xero’s business and compare it to a basket of publicly traded SaaS companies. Xero operates at the lowest end of the SMB market and its Average Revenue per Customer is second-smallest in this data set at $167 per year. In fact the ARPC is so small you can barely see it on the chart. Only WIX a website builder has a smaller ARPC. Nevertheless Xero has built a fast growing business. The company reached $62M in revenue in year 7. It has taken Xero a bit longer to reach these revenue milestones than the typical company. This may be because the business started initially in New Zealand expanded to Australia then the US & the UK unlike the majority of the others in the data set which started in the US and didn’t face cross-border market expansion until later in their growth. Historically Xero has spent far less than the median in Sales & Marketing likely because they achieved high growth rates through dominance of the accountancies in New Zealand and Australia very quickly. Xero expanded into the US in 2011 which is year five in the chart above. Not coincidentally the company has invested much more aggressively in sales and marketing at and after the US launch to displace Xero’s biggest competitor in the US Intuit’s Quickbooks. Xero does exhibit an amazing sales efficiency metric of 1.05 meaning $1 invested today in sales and marketing yields $1.05 in gropss profit next year. The median SaaS company charts 0.81 sales efficiency meaning Xero is at least 50% more efficient. Xero’s efficiency is driven by its customer acquisition strategy winning accountants and encouraging them to migrate all their business from a competitor to Xero. Winning one accountant generates more than 13 end customers and generates substantial leverage in the sales model. Xero didn’t break out its engineering spending in its financials until 2013. Of late the company has been spending about 40% of its revenue on research and development more than 10 points above the median to build out its product suite. Most notably Xero launched a payroll product in the US in early 2015. In dollar terms Xero’s net income mirrors the median. The company burned about $30M on revenues of $62M. In percentage terms the story is similar. Xero is right at the median burning about 10 points more than the median 48% of revenue compared to 37 points. Xero is an amazing SMB SaaS business to study because of the company’s ability to develop a monopoly in two smaller markets before expanding to the US which is rare. It’s much more common to see a US company move abroad. In addition Xero has employed a unique go-to-market through accountancies that generates enormous efficiencies for its sales and marketing teams. Last much of Xero’s data from the very earliest days of the company are public meaning Xero can serve as a great benchmark for other startups. A few quick things to note when examining Xero’s business. The filings are denominated in New Zealand dollars so be sure to convert to USD. Also Xero never filed an S-1 because the S-1 is a US exchange requirement and Xero trades in New Zealand but there are equivalent documents on Xero’s investor site. Last Xero has a negative gross margin for its early years which is unusual. This is because they put the majority of their operating expenses in their Cost of Goods Sold. I suspect it might be a regional accounting difference. If there are accountants reading I’d appreciate your insight. Published 2015-01-15,Published 2015-01-15
http://tomtunguz.com/segmenting-customer-pipelines/,Segmenting customer pipelines,Segmenting customer pipelines When building a freemium SaaS company or an ecommerce company or any product that requires users to move through a funnel towards an objective it’s important to track this funnel to understand where the funnel can be improved. But tracking one funnel may not be enough. The aggregated funnel may be masking conversion differences across customers segments. For example at Expensify conversion rates to paid vary quite a bit across customer size. But the total conversion-to-paid rate hides these nuances. It’s critical to understand each segment well. For each which features are missing or are too complex? How do they prefer to try and pay for the product? Which acquisition mechanic is the most effective? What marketing message resonates with the segment? This understanding is ultimately critical to the success of the product and marketing teams who must determine how to serve the different segments of the customer base effectively and efficiently. It’s also another example of why founders should teach their teams statistics. We recently built a segmented marketing funnel at Expensify. These are the steps we followed. Identify your segments. This can be done through intuition customer interviews or data science. I used company size as the first pass segmentation for Expensify but I intend to explore clustering to see if there are more nuanced segments. Define the key steps in the funnel: registration activation contact and purchase might be an example. Define other related metrics: the fraction of users that must be upsold through online channels vs inside sales the average value per customer the current penetration of the account vs the total possible value of the account. Run the analysis and see what results come about. If no insights are present or the data is relatively homogeneous it might be worth redefining the segments.

http://tomtunguz.com/sales-team-structure/,Startup Management Best Practices #3 : How to Structure a Sales and Marketing Team,Startup Management Best Practices #3 : How to Structure a Sales and Marketing Team A key component in a startup’s formula for success is educating customers about the product and driving sales. The sales and marketing teams of a startup are responsible for this. There are many ways to structure sales and marketing teams. The diagram above outlines a sales and marketing team structure that I’ve observed across many startups. It is consistent with the organizational design Salesforce used to drive revenue from $0 to $100M described Aaron Ross’s book Predictable Revenue. Jon Miller CMO of Marketo has also written an important blog post on the subject The Definitive Guide to Sales Development. The chart above shows three roles: Marketing SDR/ADR (Sales Development Rep/Account Development Rep) AE (Account Executive). Marketing teams generate Marketing Qualified Leads through content marketing and lifecycle marketing. Inbound ADR/SDRs evaluate inbound leads (from marketing and product and customer upsells). Outbound ADR/SDRs gin up their own leads through cold calling and qualify them. The typical SDR should be able to qualify on the order of 60 to 100 leads per day and generate 250 to 400 high-quality leads per month depending on the number of calls required to qualify a customer which is contigent on product complexity. These three roles (marketing inbound & outbound SDRs) comprise the marketing function which is contained in the blue rectangle in this diagram. Both Marketing and SDRs should be measured on leads generated. SDRs generally earn $50-70k depending on performance. Because each of their performance metrics are leads it’s logical to place SDRs within the marketing organization but some companies embed SDRs in Sales to align the lead quality incentives. The Account Executives in the red Sales rectangle receive qualified leads from SDRs and should aim to close a high fraction of them. In Jon Miller’s posts he reports a 7% qualified lead rate by SDRs and an 80% AE close rate. These figures can vary due to many factors: the workload of AEs the product maturity the SDR productivity product/market fit and so on. The more important figure of the wo is the AE close rate. AEs must receive highly qualified prospectt consistently so trust can be built between the AEs and SDRs. The Account Executives are measured on a new bookings figure and given a quota. There are many ways of structuring sales and marketing teams. Different markets market segments and products will demand new and novel ways of pursuing the market but this framework can serve as a roadmap and guide to the basic structure integration points and key metrics for each team.

http://tomtunguz.com/box-ipo-redux/,The Challenges SaaS Businesses Face Communicating their Financial Health,The Challenges SaaS Businesses Face Communicating their Financial Health Tien Tzuo the founder and CEO of Zuora* and former CSO/CMO at Salesforce knows SaaS businesses better than most. So when he pens an opinion about the subscription economy a term which I believe he coined I read it with great interest. Yesterday Tien wrote “These Numbers Show That Box CEO Aaron Levie Is A Genius” explaining Box’s business and growth in great detail. In the post Tien argues two important points. First current accounting practices don’t properly reflect the health of recurring revenue businesses like Box. A dollar from a recurring enterprise costumer with a multi-year lifetime value is worth much more than a dollar from a one-time transaction like buying a digital apple in an iPhone game. Because SaaS companies can forecast the revenue from existing customers with great accuracy these businesses can make deeper and longer term investments than transactional businesses. The image below shows Zuora’s take on the income statement for a subscription business which uses ARR not revenue as the key metric. Second there is a mismatch between an investment in Sales and Marketing and the revenue created by that investment. This image from David Skok’s great blog on Saas companies proves the point: The ROI for a large sales and marketing investment say doubling a sales team won’t be apparent for two years and will depress the sales productivity numbers and the margins of a SaaS business when using traditional accounting. Fast-growing SaaS companies like Box bet the deep trough of low margins and huge burn will eventually translate into enormous revenues over time with very strong ROI. In my analysis of the Box S-1 I found the Box sales efficiency metrics registered at the bottom of the cohort. What the numbers don’t say is if that sales efficiency metric is for a fully ramped sales team. But if Box decided last year to increase the sales team by 40% 40% of the sales teams in the company would still be operating at something like 50% of their quota thereby depressing this metric. Tien’s point is that the true health of a SaaS business isn’t properly communicated with the accounting systems we have in place today. I agree with him and hope that we can move to a new more accurate set of metrics akin to the ARR-based income statement Tien proposes as a way of comparing and contrasting companies with subscription business models.

http://tomtunguz.com/andy-rubin-redpoint/,One Great Adventure After the Next,One Great Adventure After the Next Yesterday Redpoint announced something amazing: Andy Rubin the creator of Android is joining Redpoint. I remember reading about Google’s Android acquisition in 2005 and wondering what would become of the technology; and then later at Google seeing some of the first versions of the G1 the first Android phone. Since then Android has become a standard and powers 81% of phone shipped last year. My partner Jeff has worked with Andy for about 20 years. First at WebTV then at Danger then again when Andy was an entrepreneur-in-residence (EIR) at Redpoint where he incubated Android before it was acquired by Google. Jeff and Andy’s relationship is an example of one of the special things that struck me about Redpoint when I joined seven years ago: the importance Redpoint places on long term relationships. Andy isn’t the only example of this kind of relationship. Redpoint partner Tim Haley recruited Satish to become an EIR at Redpoint and incubate Zimbra. After Yahoo acquired the company Satish joined Redpoint as a partner. A few years later Satish invited Javier Soltero a VMWare executive to spend time at Redpoint as an EIR. Javier and Kevin Henrikson yet another EIR who was director of engineering at Zimbra would join forces to found Acompli recently acquired by Microsoft. In the early aughts Arthur van Hoff one of the authors of Java created a company called StrangeBerry which was acquired by TiVo a Redpoint company.

http://tomtunguz.com/it-all-starts-as-a-hobby/,It all starts as a hobby,It all starts as a hobby Believe it or not this pig has a Twitter account @impeePiggy. Whenever someone drops change into the pig the pig counts the change using an optical sensor increments the savings and tweets the value of its contents using an electric imp. This deceptively intelligent pig has a lot to do with disruption: In a conversation with renowned Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen about the newspaper industry Joshua Benton remarked “The perception of the incoming disruptors is that they are low quality and therefore not really worth paying attention to.” Let’s pay attention Craig Mod’s “Subcompact Publishing” Why pay attention to this pig? Big technology changes start as hobby projects seemingly trivial applications of new technologies that quickly morph into movements. Apple began at the Home Brew Computer Club when “computer clubs [continued] to form around the county” in places like Montana. Ruby on Rails grew in popularity because programmers started using the framework for their side projects which rapidly grew into production software. Google AdSense’s internal CRM is a Rails app called Toothpaste that I cobbled together one (late) night that now serves the global team. In the same way as Apple and Rails blossomed from communities of tinkerers hardware is back in vogue as a hobby and growing quickly as a movement. I wrote in July we’re seeing the return of venture backed hardware startups which means investors are supporting these new initiatives. Even public market investors like Dan Ramsden see this wave approaching. It’s my great hope that technologies like electric imp can be the platform which piggy banks use to communicate to the web and ultimately disrupt the biggest banks. Or something like that.

http://tomtunguz.com/broad-trends-in-saas/,Four Important Data Points about Purchasing Behavior in SaaS,Four Important Data Points about Purchasing Behavior in SaaS The SaaS ecosystem has been evolving incredibly quickly. Most of the time the changes in the ecosystem are embodied in one particular company which grows exceptionally quickly. Focusing on these fast-growers the macro shifts can be hard to discern. Last week Okta released a report Business at Work sweeps across SaaS to reveal these recent evolutions. These are the points that I found most interesting. First most companies irrespective of size from 1-4k+ employees use 14 SaaS applications. Though the report doesn’t detail these 14 products I suspect there is a remarkable consistency across companies in which applications those are. Here’s my stab at that list: CRM Marketing Automation ERP Expense Management Analytics Email Collaboration Document Storage Payroll HRIS ATS IaaS Customer Support Recruiting. SaaS startups are either competing within these categories or creating a new category. The consistency of 14 apps underscores the importance of category creation for SaaS companies creating software for newer workflows in contrast to those replacing existing products. Second the chart points to the teams and departments where SaaS has the greatest penetration to date. Collaboration tools should top the list because employees bring them to work. Sales teams always looking for an edge also belong to the early adopter segment and buy CRM and online meetings software. Then finance tools for operations management and expenses. Marketing engineering and HR follow. Third mobile is increasingly important across all types of buyers. More than 20% of end users log in mobile; 2.5% log in exclusively on mobile. I’m curious how much user acquisition occurs on mobile. But if SaaS usage trends follow consumer usage - which for some ecommerce and messaging products top 70%+ mobile usage - then mobile will undoubtedly become a critical user engagement and acquisition platform. Fourth software serving engineering teams tie collaboration applications for the fastest growing types of SaaS products. PagerDuty AWS and New Relic are the three listed in Okta’s reports. Each of these companies are building terrific businesses serving a customer segment historically viewed as a challenging buyer. The SaaS ecosystem is changing quite quickly. By virtue of their position in the market Okta has a panopticon view of the types of SaaS applications succeeding in the market. And while some of the secular trends like the importance of mobile and the popularity of SaaS colloboration tools are evident others most notably the rise of SaaS for developers may be a bit more obscure.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-office-space-for-the-next-fifty-years/,The Workplace of the Future,The Workplace of the Future In this week’s New Yorker Jill Lepore reviews Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace a book whose author asks the question what is the work place of the future? The information worker is a relatively new concept. Peter Drucker coined the term in the 50s. By then companies had already developed new ways of housing information workers. The very first information workers were accountants hunched over “Bob Crachit” desks in the back rooms of factories. Booming railroad companies demanded more organization and created offices within the new skyscrapers along the Chicago skyline. With these new offices came stacks of paper and folios and cabinets in which to file them. Then the Mad Men wrought an era of typewriters and mahogany corner offices. Next Bell Labs invented the suburban office park moving offices from the city as part of post-war suburbanization and in the 70s Herman Miller crafted the now-ubiquitous cubicle which was called the “Action Office” when it launched. Oh the irony. Throughout these eras described in the book four parameters characterize each period: office location the tools used within the office the layout of the office and the vibe. How are these evolving for today’s workers? In the Bay Area San Francisco is exerting a strong gravitational pull on startups and has arguably become the nucleus of the Bay Area. The dictaphones typewriters mimeograph machines and desktop computers of yore have been replaced by standing desks adorned with Apple Cinema Displays bike racks hang from the joists in hallways exposed brick and beam has replaced sheetrock and plaster and conference rooms have become smaller often connected to the world by video conferencing. Gone are the cubicled Action Offices replaced by open floor plans which are now seemingly a thing of the past. The most prominent change though is vibe. To see what I mean sit in the log cabins adorning the 5th floor of the Twitter offices or lounge in the heavy industry hexagon-decked metallic kitchen of the HeavyBit incubator or the mushroom conference room at AirBnB. Vibe is the embodiment of a company’s culture in furniture food and decor. Vibe is a recruiting tool a PR weapon and a competitive advantage. Vibe is so important for Heroku that the founders hired a Chief Vibe Officer. The use of the workplace in this way is novel. I suspect laptops and mobile phones will also change the way we craft and construct our workplaces. I suspect we’ll see many smaller conference rooms in offices than we have in the past. Also because of the combination of mobility and urbanization much more work will be completed outside the office in cafes and parks and home. It’s fascinating to trace the arc of our workplaces and the impact our tools and work have on the places we spent most of our lives in. Increasingly the four walls that surround us are embodiments of our values. Published 2014-05-16,Published 2014-05-16
http://tomtunguz.com/out-of-my-depth/,Out of My Depth,Out of My Depth “What’s the difference between a string and a String?” I asked on the first day of my engineering internship at a startup. That comment drew some sighs from the other engineers in the cube. The pit in my stomach confirmed what I already knew - I was out of my depth. I had never programmed in Java before that day. And there I was a Java engineering intern at this startup. Over the next few months I imbibed as much as I could about object oriented programming and servlets and Struts and Tomcat and Apache and databases as I could. Boy were those engineers patient with me. They were saints. By the end of the summer thanks to the countless hours of help and explanation from the team I was a productive more confident engineer and helped ship a few (insignificant) features. But I’ll never forget that feeling of being completely lost or the gratitude I felt for the engineers who coached encouraged and explained. We are all novices at some point whether it’s the first time we fire up an IDE and write Java code utter a hello during our first sales call or autograph the incorporation documents for the first startup. Mustering the will to push through the doubt and the fear takes determination and diligence. But more so it requires asking for help and enlisting allies in a shared cause. Those engineers helped me understand the idea of succeeding together. By investing in my success they were equipping me to invest in theirs. And ultimately that’s what teamwork is all about.

http://tomtunguz.com/listening/,One of the Greatest Opportunities to Learn,One of the Greatest Opportunities to Learn > Listening is hard as my friend once said because you run the risk of having to change the way you see the world. That line stopped me cold when I was reading In the Light of What We Know because it’s so true. To set aside the way we’ve thought about an idea in the past and consider it as if it were a totally new concept is what a Buddhist might call Beginner’s Mind. It means taking the time to reflect and consider new perspectives. Consequently listening is one of the greatest opportunities to learn. Because truly innovative companies create something new they often change the way an industry works. This means many of the old ways of doing things have to be redefined and learned; and this learning often must take place very quickly for the company to survive particularly in competitive markets. Listening to customers and colleagues is often one the most important tools for learning and developing those new processes. Even the strongest willed leaders do it. Ed Catmull is a co-founder of Pixar arguably one of the most creative institutions on the planet having developed many of the most loved digital characters in recent memory like Buzz Lightyear. Pixar’s movies have grossed more than $7B and the average film grosses more than half a billion on a $120M investment - simply an amazing batting average. Catmull has written a book on creativity and in it he shares a surprising story about working with Steve Jobs. “In all the 26 years with Steve Steve and I never had one of these loud verbal arguments and it’s not my nature to do that. … but we did disagree fairly frequently about things. … I would say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he could think faster than I could. … I would then wait a week … I’d call him up and I give my counter argument to what he had said and he’d immediately shoot it down. So I had to wait another week and sometimes this went on for months. But in the end one of three things happened. About a third of the time he said ‘Oh I get it you’re right.’ And that was the end of it. And it was another third of the time in which [I’d] say ‘Actually I think he is right.’ The other third of the time where we didn’t reach consensus he just let me do it my way never said anything more about it.” Business Insider article on Creativity Inc. a book by Pixar’s CEO Being open-minded to a change in the way we see the world is at the heart of listening and ultimately learning. It’s one of the core skill sets of great companies because it provides them the capacity to be nimble and evolve as these companies shape and redefine their markets.

http://tomtunguz.com/seed-follow-ons-by-sector/,How Your Startup's Sector Affects Your Ability to Raise a Series A,How Your Startup's Sector Affects Your Ability to Raise a Series A The average seed stage startup has a 20% chance of raising a Series A according to Crunchbase data for IT startups who raised seed and Series A rounds between 2006 and 2013. But this figure varies significantly sector by sector. Below is a chart of the different startups’ sectors and their rates of raising Series A capital net of the mean of 20%. To contrast two diametric examples 40% of seed-stage search startups raised Series As while on average only 10% of hardware startups raise Series As. For an interactive chart click here. Search transportation finance and analytics startups have the best rates of Series A financing. On the other hand startups in the messaging hardware real estate and legal sectors have a much harder time typically about 50% worse than the average company. Web and Software effectively equal the average because they are the most broadly applied tags. Since search is the best business on the internet I’m not surprised by the high follow-on rates in that sector. Uber’s succcess has spawned a handful of similar businesses driving the transportation category. Finance was quietly booming but since Bitcoin broke 1000:1 USD:BTC exchange rate financial innovations are hard to miss. Analytics is likely the catch-all for big data. The startup sectors facing a harder road to Series A rounds are either competing in vibrant and fiercely competitive sectors (messaging) capital intensive sectors (hardware) or sectors that require some rarer expertise to understand (real estate and legal). Interestingly enough most of these seed stage companies raise similar size Series As. Only hardware companies raise substantially more. But there are very high variances in the data set as indicated by the error bars. The usual caveats apply in this analysis about the noisiness of Crunchbase data. Also because we don’t have knowledge of how many fund raising processes each of these startups attempted we can’t make meaningful comparisons over time or establish much in the way of causation.

http://tomtunguz.com/vertical-saas-tradeoff/,Vertical SaaS Startups Require Different Go To Market than Horizontal SaaS Companies,Vertical SaaS Startups Require Different Go To Market than Horizontal SaaS Companies Vertical SaaS requires a different go-to-market than horizontal SaaS companies. Vertical software companies a recent important trend in SaaS startups pursue customers only in a particular industry. They trade a more narrow customer base and consequent reduction in market size for a competitive advantage in that market segment. The most salient example Veeva sells software to the largest life sciences companies which are subject to a unique regulatory regime in their sales processes. A spectacularly efficient business Veeva raised only $4.5M in venture investment before going public six years after founding. Today Veeva’s market cap exceeds $3.3B. Similar large market cap examples exist in real estate (CoStar - $5.8B) insurance (Guidewire - $3.7B) logistics (Fleetmatics - $1.8B) among other categories. Because vertical SaaS companies limit their potential market size by focusing on just one type of customer they must employ a differentiated strategy to win disproportionate share of smaller market. These are the strategies I’ve observed: All vertical software companies develop uniquely focused products. A smaller target customer base may reward vertical SaaS companies with superior sales and marketing efficiencies. Fleetmatics which sells primarily to small operators of trucking fleets and recorded about $6.5k average revenue per customer at its IPO leverages its best-in-class product advantage to sign customers to three year or longer contracts establishing very favorable LTV/CAC ratios. At IPO and generating about $177M Fleetmatics recorded an estimated sales efficiency of 1.2 50% greater than the public SaaS median. Some vertical SaaS businesses employ network effects to engender winner-take-most dynamics. For example CoStar which sells data on commercial real estate transactions employs data network effects. By aggregating the most data CoStar became the industry standard. In 2012 CoStar acquired its key competitor Loopnet to consolidate these data network effects further. Consequently CoStar trades at a 9.1x forward multiple in the top 10% of SaaS companies. Not bad for a business founded in 1987. Broadened product portfolios enable vertical SaaS companies to upsell existing customers more software and cross-sell software into other teams within the existing customer base. Veeva sells content management to marketing CRM to sales and a unified data platform to analytics teams of their customers. At IPO in 2013 Veeva’s average revenue per customer reached about $750k. As of the company’s last annual report customers now pay Veeva $1.13M a 51% increase in 2 years. Choosing to start a vertical SaaS company is a strategic bet with an important trade to consider: a focused customer base which brings better sales efficiencies narrower product scope and potential winner-take-all-dynamics in exchange for a smaller theoretical market size. Understanding these dynamics are critical for crafting a vertical SaaS company’s go-to-market and also for fundraising. Published 2015-09-14,Published 2015-09-14
http://tomtunguz.com/growth-market-late-2015/,The Turbulence in Startupland,The Turbulence in Startupland Over the weekend it seemed to me that the sentiment in the valley seemed to change abruptly. Dan Primack wrote Fear and Sadness in Silicon Valley and Danielle Morrill punctuated her post Somewhere Over the Brainbow: The Unicorn Window is Closing images of unicorn cannibalism. While the attitudes may be changing the effects haven’t yet revealed themselves in the data. So is the environment truly changing? The number of megarounds investments of greater than $40M in US companies continues to surpass last year’s figures. 2015 demarcated in red in the chart above notched more than 40 megarounds in July. In fact there was only one month in 2015 that saw fewer megarounds than 2014 - the month of April. In terms of aggregate dollars invested 2015 is on pace to be another record-setting year. In this case two months in 2015 are smaller than their counterparts in 2014. Most notably investors invested $5.3B in July 2015 compared to $6.7B in July 2014. Part of this delta may be due to companies in 2015 delaying their fundraising announcement for strategic reasons. Or it may be an early harbinger of a slowing market. On the other hand August 2015 exceeded August 2014 by $1.1B. In aggregate then it’s close to a wash. through August of each Year Rounds $Bs invested 2010 55 5.3 2011 82 9.8 2012 87 7.2 2013 103 8.3 2014 191 24.0 2015 246 28.4 If we examine the data through August of each year in order to minimize the effect of delayed financings we observe that 2015 is setting the high-water mark for number of rounds and dollars invested. We’re in an unusual time. The stock market is easily perturbed while the private fundraising market booms and has for more than five years. Startups are growing faster than ever before but the mentions of layoffs at several high profile tech companies suggests some businesses’ economics may not be as favorable as once perceived and has the potential to rattle an unwavering confidence in growth. Private market multiples are twice those in the public markets yet startup IPO and M&A activity in 2015 has halved from 2014. With all these forces in tension we will see many conflicting data points and opinions - and it can be easy to lose perspective in the maelstrom. The most important things to do as a founder now are the five essential tasks that must be completed no matter the environment: think long term manage the company’s cash well by planning for the future hire great people mitigate customer churn by building great products and raise capital opportunistically. And let the data sort itself out. Published 2015-10-13,Published 2015-10-13
http://tomtunguz.com/slash-and-burn-your-calendar/,Startup Best Practices 14 - Slash and Burn Your Calendar,Startup Best Practices 14 - Slash and Burn Your Calendar When startups achieve hyper-growth many of the key internal processes begin to fail under the strain of a newer larger organization. So they must be reinvented. One of the most important internal processes but least considered is scheduling meetings. As Anne Dillard wrote “How we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives.” Most of us spend our days in meetings. Meetings like a snowball rolling down a mountain develop ever greater inertia roll down a path of their own - different from their initial purpose - and ensnare increasing numbers people as a business grows. To counter this effect James Reinhart and the team at ThredUp a clothing marketplace metamorphosing through hypergrowth slashed and burned their calendars. On a chosen weekend everyone at ThredUp deleted every standing and recurring meeting in their agendas. During the next few days the team questioned what meetings should exist who ought to attend them and what their agendas and goals should be. In addition the team pushed to cut meeting times in half from 50 to 25 minutes. The impact to the company has been dramatic. Fewer shorter more productive meetings. After all if a 100 person startup eliminates one 1 hour standing meeting each week from every employee’s calendar they will have unlocked more than an extra manyear of work to allocate - a new “free” employee. Slashing and burning calendars periodically challenges a company to allocate its most scarce resource employees’ time more effectively. By torching all the scheduling chaff that accumulates over time startups can start fresh and cultivate a schedule to maximize company and employee performance (and happiness).

http://tomtunguz.com/twitter-ads-performance/,Analyzing Twitter Ad Performance for the Last 9 Months,Analyzing Twitter Ad Performance for the Last 9 Months I’ve been promoting my Twitter account since October 2012 in effort to better understand social media content marketing and to promote that great vanity metric Twitter follower count. At the outset I promoted my account and links to blog posts. I prize followers more than one time visits to a blog because the long term marketing relationship provides many chances to bring someone to my blog. Promoting links sends traffic to a single blog post but doesn’t convert to followers with a very high rate. I spent $10 per day for 312 days and set my max bid to $2.5 per follower for people in the Bay Area. On average I spent $9.28 per day to acquire 5.3 followers for an average cost-per-follower (CPF) of $1.73. Below is the detailed data: New followers are marked in gray and lost followers those who unfollow me are marked in red. On average I gain 5 followers each day and lose 0.15 followers (that I paid to acquire). The unfollow rate has been increasing dramatically in the past few months from about 0.5% in February to 7.6% in August. This is a worrisome trend because it implies a decrease in targeting effectiveness and an increase in cost per follower (CPF). The number of impressions for my promoted account has increased by more than 5x since I started using the ads product in late 2012. This is a positive for me. The more people who see my name the better provided I don’t have to pay more. But it means that fewer ad impressions generate revenue for Twitter. Over the same time the follow rate has improved by about 5x. Because the follower growth rate has remained relatively steady the data implies that the number impressions required to garner a follower has increased by 5x in just a few months and Twitter is showing a greater number of impressions to the same users rather than diffusing those impressions over many more users. This chart confirms this trend. Darker dots indicate later months require more impressions to win a follower. Like all ad formats the Twitter promoted follower ad unit suffers decreased performance over time as users become accustomed to it. Ultimately these figures boil down to a cost to acquire a follower. The red line above is the smoothed gross cost to acquire a Twitter follower. Despite the spike in April the cost has been decreasing steadily. The blue line which is the cost net of the lost followers has also been falling. The increasing number of impressions required to win a follower don’t factor into the CPF calculation thankfully. These lines are smoothed to show the trends. In future analyses I’d like to measure the interaction rate of paid vs organic followers to determine the downstream value of these users. I suspect their retweet patterns differ quite substantially. Only with that data would it be possible to truly understand the marketing return on investment of Twitter ad spend. Overall Twitter’s ad platform seems to be a great way of building a social media audience and if the estimated ROI for your content marketing campaign can justify a $1.50 cost per follower then it’s well worth the investment.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-new-marketers/,The new marketers,The new marketers In the last 12 years marketing has been reinvented. No segment has benefitted more from this transformation than startups who have both created the new marketing and leveraged its skills to transform industries. These new marketers creating this wave have been so effective they can delay or even obviate the need for outside sales teams. Historically marketing has been pseudoscience - an undisciplined hand-wavy concoction of story telling and a “throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks” mentality protected by unmeasurable results and three martini lunches. Unlike cash-rich enterprises which bankroll unquantifiable marketing bets miserly startups can’t afford to gamble. For startups unit economics are king. A dollar invested must return more than a dollar much much more. If not the business simply won’t survive. And this discipline must be applied across the company: engineering product sales and marketing. Startups' relentless focus on unit economics compels their marketing departments to invent and discover. Scarcity is the mother of invention. As a result startups have created every major inflection point in marketing progress in the last decade. In the early 2000s Google’s AdWords punctuated the wave of real-time quantification of internet ad performance. A few years later AdSense and others brought performance marketing to the internet broadly. Next social media marketing blossomed on Facebook and Twitter. Meanwhile mobile apps created a fundamentally new customer acquisition channel. And of course email marketing was reborn with Groupon and Fab. With search web mobile and social distribution channels built other startups like Amazon Zynga and ngMoco were the first to test them understand them benchmark them and ultimately exploit them. In addition to advances in advertising performance these new marketers began influencing product to drive distribution. Rather than intuition rigorous multivariate testing drives product decisions yielding small daily optimizations which compound into huge growth. Dropbox mastered the referral campaign for its consumer storage product. Zynga and Branchout built proficiencies in viral triggers. And LogMeIn perfected the freemium model. The new marketers are a different breed - tenacious nimble and deft with numbers. They often have backgrounds in finance or consulting and act more like traders than relationship managers buying media on the fly based on algorithms and using experimental data to inform product decisions. New marketers have revolutionized the go-to-market strategies for startups by acquiring customers scalably and cost-effectively through ROI positive advertising and calculated product improvements. And in today’s entrepreneurial environment these new marketers represent powerful competitive advantages. Published 2013-01-07,Published 2013-01-07
http://tomtunguz.com/what-is-quick-ratio-hiding/,What is the Optimal Quick Ratio for Your SaaS Startup?,What is the Optimal Quick Ratio for Your SaaS Startup? What is the optimal quick ratio for your SaaS startup? Is it 4? Quick Ratio = (New MRR + Expansion MRR) / (Churned MRR + Contraction MRR) The quick ratio measures a SaaS company’s growth efficiency. The formula for quick ratio is above. It’s the new monthly recurring revenue (MRR) in a month plus the expansion MRR divided by the sum of the churned MRR and the contraction MRR. Churned MRR are customers who have not renewed contracts and contractions are those customers who have decreased their payments. Larger quick ratios are better. A startup without churn will achieve an infinite quick ratio. But using startup benchmark data what should be the right quick ratio? We can re-form the quick ratio to be stated this way: Quick Ratio = (Monthly Growth Rate + Churn Rate) / Churn Rate And if we aim to have a quick ratio of 4 this implies that a SaaS startup growing at 15% can sustain a monthly customer contraction & churn rate of 5.0% per month or 46% annually. At 20% monthly growth rate a company can record 6.7% monthly churn and still attain a quick ratio of 4. Monthly Growth Rate 10% 15% 20% Monthly Churn Possible 3.3% 5.0% 6.7% Annual Revenue Loss 33% 46% 56% This churn number is unsustainably high and we know from previous churn analyses that high churn implies lower growth rates and dramatically less efficient growth. According to Clement Vouillon’s great compendium of SaaS churn rate studies the Totango survey shows 73% of SaaS companies have an annualized churn of 0-15%. So looking at the Quick Ratios using this 7% and 15% annually we see the quick ratios are much larger. Monthly Growth Rate /Monthly Churn 10% 15% 20% 0.6% 17.7 26.0 34.3 1.2% 8.7 12.5 16.4 In fact they range from 8.7 to 34.3. As Clement notes in his analysis these churn rates are probably more indicative of mid-market price points ($15k+ ACVs) and SaaS startups serving smaller customers will observe higher churn rates. Greater Quick Ratios are always better. It’s important to be mindful of the underlying churn rates in a business when evaluating your company based on its Quick Ratio. High growth rates can mask high dollar churn rates. Thanks to Mamoon Hamid the creator of the Quick Ratio for helping me with this analysis. Published 2015-11-03,Published 2015-11-03
http://tomtunguz.com/null-hypothesis-for-entrepreneurs/,The Founder’s Null Hypothesis,The Founder’s Null Hypothesis Credit: xkcd.com Over breakfast I caught up with a close friend an entrepreneur who is exploring a number of ideas for his next venture. He and his co-founder want to test their way to success with the Lean Startup Model. But they have added a twist to the Lean Startup process I call the Founder’s Null Hypothesis. Here’s how it works: First this entrepreneur assumes each of his ideas will fail - the null hypothesis. Then he and his co-founder write down a set of milestones or metrics that if achieved or proven would imply the idea is a good one. These tend to be quantitative customer feedback metrics. Next the team allocates one to three weeks to achieve the milestones they created. If the team achieves them they pursue the idea. The team assumes the burden of proof to show an opportunity exists and is worthwhile before writing a line of code. This approach reminded me of an idea from statistics the null hypothesis which is a technique for defeating confirmation bias eloquently described by Francis Bacon: “The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it.” It’s easy to fall in love with an idea and create a thousand reasons why it might succeed. But that feeling could be confirmation bias. On the other hand if a team assumes all ideas will fail creates a target for disproving that the idea will fail and exceeds those goals the team can make a measured and rational decision about which idea to pursue.

http://tomtunguz.com/api-adjacencies/,How APIs Will Evolve,How APIs Will Evolve Over the course of the past few months I’ve built six projects that use APIs from Twitter Google LinkedIn Mailchimp and others. These APIs enable me to extract data that I use to analyze this blog and build tools to be more effective. Once I extract the data from their platforms no API platform understands why or how I use the data. While web companies measure many things on websites and mobile apps very few apply the same rigor to APIs. I believe the simple API will evolve to become an API Hub. An API Hub combines starts with access to an important API and combines access to other APIs with the infrastructure needed to process all that data in one place. An API Hub offers the ability to create something useful. When I connect to an API today I request some data (tweets) combine it with some other data (traffic) and then create something useful whether it’s an automated report (tweets correlation to traffic) or some kind of internal tool (twitter recirculation). A third party server in my case an Amazon box on Heroku processes all this data. An API hub would provide Google an understanding of which data sets API users frequently combine with Google Analytics data what analyses users perform on Google data and the products that are built using those API features which could provide insight into Google’s roadmap. Users would pay for an API hub the way I pay for an Amazon server today to process my data. The API hub could stem the losses incurred from operating APIs by charging for the ongoing compute for analysis. APIs offer two key value propositions to end customers: data portability (move data to another provider) and data access. But they offer little to the platform serving the API aside from assuaging customer data portability concerns. By combining elastic infrastructure and a seamless way of connecting other data sources an API hub creates strategic insight into customer use cases informing the roadmap generating revenue and retaining customers.

http://tomtunguz.com/mckinseys-3-horizons/,Your Startup’s Three Horizons,Your Startup’s Three Horizons Credit: Karl Scotland When I started at Redpoint in 2008 I wanted to find every way of analyzing companies I could. Consultants scrutinize the inner-workings of companies daily and create simple frameworks for explaining their operations. So I bugged a handful of friends with experience at the Big 3 consulting firms for their most used frameworks. Recently I came across an old friend a framework I studied then called McKinsey’s Three Horizons in The Lean Entrepreneur an anthology of lean startup techniques and case studies. The Three Horizons is a simple idea. Each project within a business follows an S-curve. At the beginning the business must invest in the project then if successful the project grows and makes money and last the project reaches maturity and declines. This is as true for startups as Fortune 50s. If a management team can take the profits from the first successful project and invest in the second project during the height of the first project then two S curves overlap and again for a third. This this the idea behind the three horizons and the genesis of the chart above. For a business to prosper over many years it must invest in more than one project or product. The management team will also want to diversify the company’s product portfolio. But investing in all of them at the same time will diffuse the company’s focus and resources so sequencing the products becomes important. The Three Horizons helps to think through that sequencing. I’ve found the Three Horizons helpful in pitch meetings and board meetings to think through the evolution of a startup’s business. It helps me answer questions like: Which project should the company take on first? When should we start a second or third project? What is the ultimate vision for the business? Is the probability of success for the business conditional on the first product’s success or can the business succeed with the product from the second horizon? The Three Horizons is a fantastic strategic tool. I hope you can find some use for it at your startup. Published 2013-08-16,Published 2013-08-16
http://tomtunguz.com/a-pattern-language/,Data Design Patterns - The Building Blocks of a Data Driven Culture,Data Design Patterns - The Building Blocks of a Data Driven Culture In 1977 a British polymath named Christopher Alexander who studied Math and Architecture at Cambridge and was awarded Harvard’s first PhD in architecture published a book titled A Pattern Language: Towns Buildings Construction. This book would transform the architecture world and more surprisingly forever influence the way computer scientists write software. A Pattern Language prescribed rules for constructing safe buildings from the layout of a region of 8M people to the size and shape of fireplaces within a home. Today A Pattern Language still ranks among the top two or three best-selling architecture books because it created a lexicon of 253 design patterns that form the basis of a common architectural language. A decade after A Pattern Language was published Kent Beck and Ward Cunningham two American software engineers presented the paper “Using Pattern Languages for Object Oriented Programs” that reshaped Alexander’s ideas for computer programming. The paper catalyzed a movement to identify programming patterns that solved problems in elegant consistent ways that had been proven in the real world. It inspired the Gang of Four to write the seminal computer science book Design Patterns which formalized concepts like WYSIWYG Iterators and Factories among others. These design patterns have infiltrated the curriculums and patois of computer scientists ever since. Design patterns continue to spread widely. For example management science calls them best practices. As the prevalence of data within companies surges and businesses adopt data-driven cultures data design patterns will become emerge - much as they have in management architecture and computer science. Some of these design patterns exist. But over the next few years they will be formalized and refined. Looker is taking a big step in that direction with their release of Blocks. Blocks are design patterns that enable a data scientist to define an active user once so that everyone else in the company can begin to analyze user activity using a consistent definition. These data design patterns have been field tested across hundreds of customers and documented extensively. And they are meant to be generalizable and flexible across different data sources like Salesforce Marketo Zendesk and meant to be tailored to the needs of each organization. Much as the design patterns in computer science and architecture simplified the tasks of coders and architects data design patterns like Looker’s Blocks simplify the lives of data scientists and ensure that everyone using data is using the right data every time. Data design patterns are still relatively new and will evolve as companies create and capture new types of data and develop new analytical methods to understand the trends within. These data building blocks will be just as fundamental to data science and analysis as Alexander’s were to architecture and the Gang of Four’s were to computer science.

http://tomtunguz.com/content-syndication/,Choosing a Content Marketing Strategy for Your Startup,Choosing a Content Marketing Strategy for Your Startup For bloggers and content marketers choosing the right content syndication tools to distribute posts is critical to developing an audience. The author/marketer must balance four attributes: distribution measurement retention and brand. Table 1: Balancing Syndication Tools Attributes Channel Distribution Measurement Retention Brand RSS Poor: only one subscriber Poor: volatile metrics Good but declining So so: controlled by RSS reader Email Poor: only one subscriber double-opt in Poor: limited engagement stats Poor: Low unsubscribe rates; GMail filtering decreases visibliity Good: total control over UI Content Hubs Great: siphon site traffic new readers Good: proprietary tools or GA Poor: often lacking follow or subscribe mechanisms Poor: limited control over UI Social Media Volatile: dependent on the audience but huge upside potential Great: use traditional web analytics plus follower data plus retweet So so: follower model creates 2 way relationship; no way to assure delivery Good: customize profile + traffic goes to website RSS’s end is nigh. Google shuttered Reader. Feedburner’s subscriber metrics of this blog swing by 50% or more. Plus the relationship between author and reader is one way (push). The email newsletter currently in vogue faces its own challenges. First the new Google tabbed inbox relegates emailed posts to the tertiary Updates bucket. Second email limits discoverability of other content on a site. Last email curtails community participation and has its own measurement limitations created by pixel tracking. Content Hubs (Quora Medium Svbtle) generate huge amounts of traffic which can be siphoned but retention of those users can be challenging because often follower models are missing or the culture of the sites tend to be episodic and content driven rather than individual or personality driven. I prefer writing here because Svbtle champions individuals and provides follower tools via Twitter. Social media (Facebook Twitter) can drive huge amounts of traffic and create mechanisms for bidirectional communication but the acceptable content lengths are much shorter either because of hard constraints or cultural norms. Social media must be pared with a blogging platform of some kind. I’ve chosen to combine writing on a content hub (Svbtle) with social media distribution (Twitter Quibb Hacker News) because I think their strengths complement each other. About 1500 subscribe to this blog by RSS but I think that number will dwindle with time. Another few hundred subscribe by email. Unfortunately because of the poor measurement systems in place it’s difficult to understand how to better serve the needs of those users. It’s much easier to gauge the reaction to content on social media than anywhere else. Every business will want to create a different type of relationship with its users and build its brand in a way true to their core values. Understanding the pros and cons of different syndication channels is key to that content marketing strategy. Published 2013-08-19,Published 2013-08-19
http://tomtunguz.com/margins-and-acquisition-prices/,The Relationship Between Margins and Acquisition Prices,The Relationship Between Margins and Acquisition Prices Amazon operates its businesses at very close to break-even zero net margin to win the greatest share and prevent competition from undercutting them. This is as true for their books business as their infrastructure business AWS. Bezos has explicitly stated this strategy and it’s the one that has led to Amazon’s massive success in many different lines of business. Over sushi a friend explained to me that this strategy might also extend to the way the company views acquisitions. If Amazon’s strategy is to run most of their businesses at break-even including acquisitions then the value of a profitable and fast-growing startup to Amazon is decidedly less than to a another acquirer who will run a business at greater margin if for no other reason than the startup will spin-off less cash under Amazon’s low-margin strategy. Many acquirers will pursue attractive larger revenue generating startups with an aim to keep running the business as is (without changing the economics of the business). Ideally acquisitions increase the revenue and profitability of the the parent company increasing stock price and enabling the parent to raise capital more easily in the public markets. After that speculative conversation about Amazon’s M&A strategy I’ve been wondering whether all things being equal the acquirer who pays the most for a startup is the one willing/capable to run the business at the highest margin. Of course I’m setting aside all strategic considerations (technology ownership brand sales synergies etc). What do you think?

http://tomtunguz.com/startup-investment-trends-2015/,Startup Investment Trends in 2015,Startup Investment Trends in 2015 In the last six months VCs have invested more than $57B according to Mattermark data which puts 2015 on pace to exceed 2000 as the year the most venture capital will be deployed ever. Which sectors are benefitting from all these venture dollars? The chart above contrasts the top 12 sectors receiving venture funding in the US and plots the relative share of dollars invested by month. The red line indicates the monthly data point the thin blue line shows a linear regression trend line and the shadow around the blue line is the area of standard error. Sectors receiving an increasing amount of investment include biotechnology financial technology healthcare and social networking. Meanwhile analytics and commerce companies are raising less as a fraction of total dollars than they have in the past. If we compare the seed investment patterns to the growth investment patterns a few other trends pop out of the data. For example although eCommerce companies raise more than 15% of the seed dollars in the past 12 months the sector has raised a smaller share - 11% of growth investments. In contrast enterprise software companies punch below their weight in seed investments but above their weight in growth dollars. Most striking is the disparity with marketing and education companies who fetch substantial seed investment dollars but see only about 1 ⁄3 as many growth dollars - indicating differences in preference of the early and later stage markets. The converse is true for analytics companies. This data shows which sectors are coming into and out of vogue with investors. Unfortunately it doesn’t reveal which sectors will generate the best returns or in which sector the next great startup will be built! Published 2015-07-09,Published 2015-07-09
http://tomtunguz.com/nest-implications-iot/,What the Nest Acquisition Means for the Internet of Things,What the Nest Acquisition Means for the Internet of Things As recently as six months ago it was easy to disregard the Internet of Things (IoT) as just a theoretical market that Cisco measured in the trillions but whose potential never seemed to materialize. That’s all changing. The past year ushered in a new era for the Internet of Things for three reasons. First venture capitalists invested nearly $1B of capital in the IoT in 2013 more than 3% of all VC investments by dollars. Second the sector witnessed its first IPO Control4. And third Nest’s sale to Google last week set the high water mark for IoT acquisitions measured at more than $3B firmly establishing the category as a strategic imperative for the world’s largest technology companies. The IoT momentum generated in 2013 will only continue to grow as the number of connected device startups and products compounds each looking to satisfy an unmet consumer want or enterprise need. By 2017 each consumer will have 5 connected devices more than double today’s per capita figure which potentially doubles the total revenue of the hardware market. To realize the true potential of the IoT dream the development of connected devices must be made simpler and easier. In addition all of these billions of new devices will need to communicate with each other seamlessly. That’s why I’m so excited about the future for IoT companies in particular Electric Imp. In the same way Amazon Web Services advanced online storage and computing infrastructure simplifying deployment and reducing launch costs sfor startups Electric Imp frees innovators to focus on the things they do best - build great products. No longer do companies have to create back-end infrastructure and worry about connectivity scalability and compatibility; they can focus on the design and differentiation of their product. 2013 was just the beginning for the IoT. With billions of new devices and innumerable new uses for them our world will change dramatically over the next decade fueled by the innovation of entrepreneurs building novel connected products.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-3-different-strategies-of-venture-funds/,The 3 Different Strategies of Venture Funds,The 3 Different Strategies of Venture Funds As I wrote about in a post on aligning founder and VC incentives it’s important for entrepreneurs to understand their own ambitions and the ambitions of investors. The most important part of that is understanding the financial motivations and the dynamics of the industry VCs face. Typically VCs adopt primarily one of three strategies with a fund [1]: Small fund small ownership positions many investments in markets that will consistently generate sub-$100M acquisitions. Medium fund sizable ownership positions a moderate number of investments in markets that will occasionally generate $150M to $800M acquisitions. Large fund moderate ownership positions a moderate number of investments that will consistently generate $1B+ acquisitions. I’m going to use CBInsights’ 2012 Private Technology Company M&A Data data to demonstrate why VCs adopt these three strategies. Exit Distribution Below is the chart showing the number of private technology company acquisitions of various sizes ranging from $0 to $1.2B. As you might expect 53% of acquisitions by number are sub-$50M and the $1B+ transactions generate 19% of the proceeds. Another Perspective on the Data: Quartiles But let’s look at the estimated proceeds in another way by quartile. Each of the four outcome buckets below generated the same amount of return to investors[5] about $11B in 2012. Obviously the left-most bucket requires many more acquisitions than the right-most bucket to achieve the same result but there are twenty-one times fewer $1B exits than sub-$50M exits so the odds of investing in those billion dollar winners are much slimmer. Pick your poison. Matching a Fund to a Quartile Given it is possible to generate the same gross returns in each quartile it is theoretically possible to construct four different portfolios with four different strategies and each generate the same returns. Let’s look at those portfolios: Fund Small Fund Early Fund Blended Fund Growth Fund Target Quartile 1 / $150M 2 / $400M 3 / $800M 4 / $1200M Avg 2012 Exit[4] 45 239 527 1005 Fund Size 75 250 400 1000 Avg Investment 1 5 10 25 Investments 75 50 40 40 Target Return 3 3 3 3 Ownership 10% 25% 20% 15% M&A/IPO Ratio [2] 70% 70% 70% 70% Gross Proceeds to Achieve Multiple 225 750 1200 3000 M&A Market Cap Required 1575 2100 4200 14000 Number of Exits Required 35 9 8 14 Investment Success Rate Required 47% 18% 20% 35% Assuming each fund pursues a pure strategy of targeting exits within their quartile [1] the small fund will make 75 investments of which 47% must be sold at an average of $45M. The Early Fund must invest in 50 companies and sell 9 of those for $250M each. The Blended Fund must invest in 40 companies and sell 8 for $527M each and the Growth Fund must invest in 40 companies and sell 14 at $1B each. Each of these hypothetical funds would generate a 3x for their investors. In summary small funds tend to make many bets and aim for high success rates. Medium funds are able to accept close to half of the failure rate of a pure strategy small fund while the hypothetical growth fund takes a smaller amount of risk. The Relationship Between Risk and Ownership Targets Not coincidentally the ownership percentages typical are inversely proportional to risk tolerance. The greater the acceptable failure rate the more important ownership becomes because the winners must cover a fund’s losses. There are many different ways of constructing a fund’s strategy and those strategies vary with the risk tolerances of the individuals raising the fund innovation cycles and financial market cycles. But at the core of the venture business are these three fundamental investment strategies. Notes The data I use here are all estimates because I don’t have access to CBInsights source data. I removed the Facebook IPO from calculations because of its disproportionate and skewing effect on the data. [1] VCs often blend these strategies in portfolio construction. Every investor aspires to a $1B+ exit. But to simplify the analysis I’m assuming funds pursue only a single strategy. And of course no investor has perfect knowledge of the ultimate acquisition price of a business but instead uses market size public company multiples and other data to form a proxied estimate for that value. [2] NVCA data excluding FB IPO; rough average for last 3 years [3] CBInsights Data [4] My calculations based on estimates of CBInsights Data [5] Gross returns will be the same but cash on cash investment multiples will vary.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-return-of-venture-backed-hardware/,The Return of Venture Backed Hardware,The Return of Venture Backed Hardware Recently hardware companies have been popping up in all kinds of places. Nest is building the next thermostat. Sonos sells seamless and beautiful soun systems. Thalmic Labs and Leap Motion are innovating in alternate forms of computing control. Electric Imp is building the platform-as-a-service to connect devices to the web via Wifi and so on. Hardware investments are blossoming because software is reinvigorating the market. Hardware companies face deeper logistical challenges greater likelihood of margin erosion and more complex go-to-market strategies than their software cousins. But subscription revenue streams like streaming music services or device remote control breathe life into hardware companies driving ultimately higher margins and more sustainable revenue streams. In response to these trends the hardware hacker community is flourishing. Winners at many Bay Area hackathons focus explicitly on hardware hacks using Arduino to commandeer electric devices. Others are building applications atop Raspberry Pi. These often teams comprise both hardware engineers and web engineer. Hardware represents new exciting challenges to conquer. It’s precisely this union of hardware actively communicating with software in novel ways that is electrifying venture capitalists. Hardware companies may always face additional complexity but the reward has never been larger: new markets subscription revenue streams and phenomenal teams make for great investments.

http://tomtunguz.com/gopro-s1/,The Characteristics of a Billion Dollar Consumer Hardware Startup,The Characteristics of a Billion Dollar Consumer Hardware Startup According to the WSJ GoPro is the largest consumer hardware IPO in 23 years though like most entrepreneurs I don’t remember the Duracell IPO. The last consumer hardware company IPO I remember is Tivo which was in 1999. Because GoPro is the first sizable consumer hardware IPO in eons and because the startup world has a blossoming hardware segment I thought it would be interesting to compare and contrast a top consumer hardware startup with the benchmarks of public SaaS companies using GoPro’s S-1. I have three goals with this analysis. First to understand GoPro’s business better. Second to benchmark GoPro’s capital needs capital efficiency and attractiveness to investors. Third to draw conclusions for other hardware startups. Founded in 2004 GoPro is about 10 years old and during the past few years has witnessed spectacular growth. In its sixth year in business the company generated $65M in revenue and in its ninth year just short of $1B. The revenue figures and the annual growth rates of the business are depicted in the chart above. It’s astounding for a business generating $500M in annual revenue to grow more than 100% in a year. In comparison the median public SaaS company grew 40-58% in years six through nine reaching about $100M in revenue. To be fair there are significant differences in the subscription revenue of SaaS companies and the one-time transactional revenue of a consumer hardware business. In particular subscription business is far more predictable than consumer purchasing habits. The second major difference in revenue is the gross margin. GoPro’s gross margin has dropped from 50% to 37% in four years. The chart above shows the decrease in gross margin. The company has witnessed an increase in the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) in the past few years. According to the GoPro S-1 COGS include the components of the camera the shipping costs the selling costs warranty and replacement costs and write downs for excess inventory. SaaS companies benefit from the elasticity of the cloud. As a result there is no true need to predict demand aside from hiring the staff to support customers. Consequently public SaaS companies operate with a 67% average gross margin roughly twice that of GoPro. Let’s dig a bit deeper into GoPro’s cost structure. The chart above shows the four different expense categories GoPro reported in its S-1: Advertising General and Administrative Research and Development and Sales and Marketing. I’m not intimately familiar with the company but I’ll hypothesize about the trends behind this data. Advertising expenditures have fallen as a percentage of revenue. Perhaps the company has de-emphasized ads a growth channel because the brand has become synonymous with the category and the majority of the market is aware. G&A expenses have likely fallen as revenues have increased dramatically but staff have grown at a slower rate. R&D expense seems to is increasing. Given the amount of competition in the market from Contour Sony Canon and others and that the product is using as far as I know commodity semiconductor and optical components GoPro must continue to invest in product differentiation including better cameras and better software which they provide for free. Selling and marketing expenses increased and fell. I suspect GoPro sells most of their hardware through retailers. As the company has increased its sales throughput it likely has been able to negotiate much better terms with retailers thus decreasing selling and marketing expenses. These investment trends particularly the R&D investment trends differ substantially from SaaS companies which spend more than twice as much in Sales and Marketing about 50% of revenue and about twice as much in R&D - about 20%. Because SaaS companies have substantially higher gross margins they can afford to invest more in both functions. Let’s look at GoPro’s Net Income trends. The company has been profitable for the past four years at least but before its IPO Net Income fell to about 5% of revenues. Contrast this trend with the average of -18% Net Income of the average SaaS company. SaaS companies have been telling the market that the long lifetime values of subscription customers enables higher spending to achieve higher growth. Again this ties back to the difference between transactional revenue and subscription revenue. GoPro aims to be profitable with one customer on the first transaction hence better profitability. One of the refrains about hardware businesses is their capital inefficiency. Because hardware companies must spend money to manufacture goods and typically are only paid once the consumer buys the device hardware startups may have huge amounts of money tied in working capital. But GoPro bucks this trend. In a previous analysis of SaaS companies I calculated a figure called Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) which is the ratio between the revenues of the company the year it went public to the amount of venture dollars raised. In other words how many revenue dollars did one invested VC dollar create. The average for the most recent SaaS publics is 2.0 two dollars of revenue per investment dollar. GoPro’s ROIC is 3.4: $288M raised and nearly a $1B in revenue. Amazingly GoPro is 50% more capital efficient than the average SaaS company. Of course GoPro does have a debt line of about $100M to finance inventory. The median SaaS company with debt operates with $55M in short and long term debt for comparison. Given all those data points how ultimately does an incredibly fast-growing relatively high-margin consumer hardware company perform in the public markets compared to SaaS companies? GoPro more than doubled in its first few days of trading and as of today the company trades at a ratio of 5.3x (Enterprise Value to LTM Revenue) which is precisely half of the average SaaS company. There’s no question GoPro is an exceptional company and it wouldn’t be an overstatement to call it a once-in-a-generation company. Now worth more than $5B GoPro is a terrific example of what is demanded of a consumer hardware company to become publicly traded. GoPro defined a category developed a brand sustained amazing growth rates and has invested to attract new customers and defend its existing customer base. It’s a great role model for hardware startups to follow. Published 2014-07-07,Published 2014-07-07

Every decision since that point had been made with that value in mind. Netflix: freedom. Apple: simplicity. Starbucks: quality. Nike: inspiration. Google: focus on the user. Zappos: service Defining a business’s one core value it’s brand identity is essential to its success. This core value originates within the company is reinforced through culture and ultimately permeates the organization through product decisions marketing copy and customer interaction.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-spend-allocation-benchmarks/,The Ratio of Engineers to Sales People in Billion Dollar SaaS Startups,The Ratio of Engineers to Sales People in Billion Dollar SaaS Startups Constrained by a limited budget while seeking to grow as quickly as possible startup founders must decide how to balance growing their engineering teams with their sales & marketing teams. To help inform those decisions I’ve benchmarked the relative sizes of the sales and engineering teams of the 36 publicly-traded SaaS companies from founding to IPO typically 7 years later. The graph above shows the average Sales & Marketing allocation in turquoise and Research & Development investment in red. In the early years of these startups sales and marketing salaries consumed about 90% of revenues and slowly fell to 45%. Engineering commanded 50% of revenue which also declined over time as revenue increased and more of that revenue was harvested as profit or re-invested elsewhere in the business. The average founding team tends to be 2 people one of whom is an engineer. When a company is founded the sales/marketing to engineer ratio is 1:1. After the first year this ratio for the public SaaS companies increases to 2:1 (S&M:R&D) for the life of the company. Year Since Founding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Median Revenue in $M 2.6 3.5 11.3 25.2 55.2 69.6 98.1 Sales : Eng Ratio 1.5 3.5 2.0 1.7 1.9 2.4 2.1 Sample Size 1 1 5 9 12 16 18 This table above shows the data in a bit more detail including the sample size for each year. Only LogMeIn provided data in their S-1 about the first two years after founding so the quality of the data there is questionable but not wildly inaccurate from my experience. For those seeking even more detail box plots below show the distribution for Sales & Marketing and Research & Development. They tell a similar story but expose the variance across companies. Notes about the Analysis First these ratios aren’t a recipe for success just data to inform decisions. Each business is different because of the industry they serve the go-to-market strategy and the particularities of their customers acquisition processes. Second the sales and marketing spend used in these calculations is the one provided by these companies in their S-1s and 10-ks which includes all media purchasing event budgets and other marketing spend. None of these startups break out marketing spend in their financial statements. But typically somewhere around 15% of total revenue is spent on marketing and PR and my rough estimate of media spend is 7% of total revenue which would decrease the S&M/R&D ratios by about 15% from those listed above. Third these companies lump all engineering spend together so the same is true for research and development. I’m assuming all R&D for these businesses is product development even if a SaaS company management team decides it is prudent to develop a drone program or another project othogonal to the current business.

http://tomtunguz.com/job-interviews/,The Most Effective Questions to Use When Interviewing Candidates,The Most Effective Questions to Use When Interviewing Candidates Most interviews are a waste of time. According to Adam Grant a professor of Organizational Behavior at Wharton “standard interviews only accounted for 8% of the differences in performance and productivity.” The typical interview fails to predict performance accurately because it is subject to interviewer biases and candidate biases and fails to compare the candidates with a consistent rubric. In a talent market as competitive as today’s startups who can more accurately assess candidates’ future performance will create a tremendous recruiting efficiency and ultimately execution advantage. Though no interview system will predict future performance flawlessly structured interviews are three times more predictive than unstructured interviews. In short a structured interview process consists of three things: first the characteristics of the ideal candidate are established at the outset; second a team creates the questions used to establish whether a candidate embodies those characteristics ahead of the process; three the interviewing team scores each candidate on a numerical score. When I interviewed PMs at Google we used a very structured interview process. These are the core features of Google’s process at the time: The Google PM team selected four essential attributes for new PMs: technical ability communication skills intellect and Googliness/conscientiousness. A group of experts in this case long time PMs create a library of situational judgement questions that represent typical situations a PM at Google might face 1 . These are shared across the PM team. The interview committee tasked each interviewer to screen for all four but focus on two of the key attributes in particular. The specific two attributes were indicated in an email before the interview. Interviewers score each candidate on a 1-5 scale. The interview feedback is aggregated by the hiring committee filtered by score and then discusses each candidate above the threshold in greater detail. Periodically interviewers were trained on identifying and mitigating their own interview biases. Every company will develop its own hiring practices. But the research on employing structured interviews with situational judgement questions is a compelling argument to reconsider the traditional unstructured interview. 1 There are many ways to implement Situational Judgement Questions. Research shows they can be delivered online or asked as a multiple choice quiz with the same predictive power as in person which means they can be very effective tools for high volume screening.

http://tomtunguz.com/twitter-followers/,Building Content Strategy by Segmenting and Analyzing Twitter Followers,Building Content Strategy by Segmenting and Analyzing Twitter Followers To answer that question you have to look for examples of the best storytellers. The best storytellers are the television studios. They divide the day into different segments to reach different audiences. Morning: news. Midday: soap operas. Evening: Nightly news segues into primetime sitcom. Late night: news segues into comedy. An entrepreneur told me a few weeks ago when we where talking about how to build a blog audience and I had asked him how he thought about content strategy. In short segmentation was his answer. Figure out all the customer types and give each one what they want. Since that conversation I’ve thought a lot about what it means for this blog. Should every week contain a post targeted to one particular audience segment? If so which are the main segments within the audience? How would I even generate such an analysis? In the end I co-opted an existing tool. Over the past week I’ve been using my Twitter Game to bucket my roughly 7k Twitter followers and gathered some quantitative and some qualitative conclusions from the analysis. First the quantitative results: 6% are company/corporate accounts 20% are company founders 23% are based in the Bay Area 7% are based in NYC 3610 average number of followers Second the qualitative analysis: While I recognized many names in my Twitter follower list it became clear that Twitter isn’t a great stay-in-touch/remarketing tool. Of the people whom I’ve met through working at Redpoint the fraction following me on Twitter is tiny less than 10%. That could be because of my lack of follow-up marketing or it could be because many acquaintances don’t use Twitter in this way or it could be these acquaintances don’t care what I have to say. I can’t say which. Twitter descriptions are more informative than I would have thought. Some people don’t fill them out or post mantras but many users list their current positions and employers and for the vast majority of the 7k followers I didn’t need to pull up their LinkedIn profiles to understand whom they are. Service providers (lawyers real estate agents PR firms design firms) constitute the second largest segment after founders. I suspect they use Twitter as I do as a form of business development and lead generation. While there are some spam accounts among my followers there are fewer than I would have thought. I didn’t classify them but I’d estimate it’s 5% or less. Conclusions This blog does help me reach my target audience: founders of companies in the Bay Area New York and around the world. Developing more sophisticated segments than this first-pass analysis is challenging without surveying the audience or performing engagement analysis on the content - which likely should be my next step. Twitter should build or license a tool that performs audience analysis for all its large customers and users. Knowing the basic demographics of an audience could improve content engagement and ultimately monetization. How do you think about your Twitter followers and how to build a blog to serve them?

I didn’t graph the 2012 or 2013 data because the Crunchbase team told me the data sets need about 2 years to mature. Most of the categories are up and to the right. Advertising hardware messaging music and PR are the notable exceptions with substantial decreases. On the whole then startups are competing with more and more other startups to raise capital. Below is a chart of the most competitive categories in 2011 those with the greatest rates of company formation. The first four tags: web mobile enterprise and software are catchall. Then on down the list. Given this trend in 2011 and analogous trends in the ten years of the data set we can evaluate the changes in ability to fundraise as the number of startups in a category increases. This last chart shows the correlation between the rate of company formation and the average dollars raised per company. On the whole the relationship between the number of new companies founded in a sector in a year and the startup cohort’s ability to raise money is very weak an average R^2 of -.11. So we can explain about 10% of the variance of dollars raised per startup through increased competition - not very much at all. In aggregate the effect of competition doesn’t seem to be meaningful. At a micro-level it could be that while several companies in a sector do compete for investment they also each create awareness and excitement about the category which overall keeps the dollars raised per startup relatively equally. Though this is just speculation. In any case these data don’t show any meaningful relationship between number of entrants in a category and fundraising success. The corollary to this analysis might be a startup’s biggest challenge isn’t its competition but finding a way to grow scalably. Published 2014-03-03,Published 2014-03-03
http://tomtunguz.com/competition-from-incumbents/,Using Vaporware to Validate a Product Idea and Generate Demand for Your Startup,Using Vaporware to Validate a Product Idea and Generate Demand for Your Startup In 1964 IBM announced a mainframe computer family called the System 360. The mainframe wouldn’t ship for another three years but the announcement reduced the mainframe sales of their competitor Control Data Corporation sufficiently to warrant an FBI investigation. And so a new marketing technique was born. To be clear there are many different forms of vaporware. Coined in the early 80s by Esther Dyson to describe software companies preannouncing a product the term vaporware can refer to three different types of these announcements. There’s IBM’s practice of pre-announcing a product with the intent to gain competitive advantage which violates antitrust law. Second vaporware also refers to products that were announced but never shipped like the iPhone predecessor Apple’s Wizzy Active Lifestyle Telephone or WALT.. Last and most useful vaporware is software that’s pre-announced to gauge customer demand. In the consumer hardware world vaporware has a different name: crowdfunding. Every Kickstarter and Indiegogo project are vaporware. A team creates a project page with a pitch and a request for money. The product movie album or comic book won’t be completed for quite some time. But this type of marketing serves as terrific demand generation. Vaporware can also be used as a product discovery tool. Sendwithus an email automation company describes how they validated their SaaS product without building it. They aimed to “gather information about what a great product might look like.” And the founders created Sendwithus Zero a $28 experiment that collected data on the features customers valued the most - which informed the product roadmap when it was time to build the product. The founders of Optimizely Dan Siroker and Pete Koomen used this same idea to determine the best idea to pursue after deciding to pivot from their education company CarrotSticks. Dan and Pete sold two $1000 licenses to customers based on a landing page. Not restricted to products as a whole vaporware can also be used to inform individual features. Nick Kishfy writes about using this technique in live products by creating a new button in a mobile app that he calls the Button to Nowhere. By measuring how many users explore the feature a team can proxy the demand. There can be downsides to employing vaporware as a market research tactic. Some Sendwithus users expressed their dissatisfaction at having been unknowing participants in an experiment. In the Button to Nowhere experiment Nick recommends telling users they’ve discovered an experimental feature to mitigate some of this risk. When used properly vaporware can be a terrific product discovery product validation and demand generation technique. Published 2015-10-19,Published 2015-10-19
http://tomtunguz.com/tech-consolidation/,How Healthy is the Public Technology Market?,How Healthy is the Public Technology Market? In the last 35 years the tech industry has exploded in size from $62B in total market cap to more than $9.7T today as the chart above shows. In that time the tech industry has birthed some behemoths. In 2013 Apple became the largest publicly traded company the first time a technology company held that distinction. Despite the number of massive companies built over the past three decades these tech giants represent an increasingly small amount of the total value in the technology sector. In 1981 the top ten technology companies represented 95% of the global IT market cap. Today that share has fallen to 26% and the ratio continues to fall a very positive trend. This fragmentation is an indicator of how much opportunity exists for startups to seize. If the tech industry were consolidating it would indicate the very largest tech companies were leveraging their market power to win share. The gradual reduction in market cap concentration is driven by the huge growth in the total number of publicly traded companies to 6037 from 37 in that time span a 17.6% CAGR in publicly traded tech companies over the past 30 years. Also geographic diversification has been an important factor. Three of the largest 10 tech companies today are outside the US: China Mobile ($208B) Vodafone ($190B) and Samsung ($170B). I expect that trend to continue. Interestingly the typical market cap of a tech company hasn’t changed over time at a median of roughly $1.6B. But the ratio between the average and the largest company has exploded from 22x to more than 310x meaning today Apple is 310x the size of the average publicly traded tech company. The big are getting bigger. Looking historically at the trends in the public tech market and turning toward 2014 and beyond the tech market is vibrant and healthy. It’s a terrific time to be starting and growing technology companies. Published 2014-01-06,Published 2014-01-06
http://tomtunguz.com/managing-the-monkey/,Startup Best Practices 4 - Managing Monkeys,Startup Best Practices 4 - Managing Monkeys You’re walking down the hallway at work from one meeting to the next. A colleague or report stops you en route asks for a minute and presents an important problem. It’s easy to respond with “let me think about it” and duck into the meeting. In that half-second all the responsibility of the decision has been transferred. Unlike a minute ago you have the monkey on your back. The challenge with these situations is two-fold. First you’re unlikely to have enough information to make a decision. Second no time has been allocated to solving the problem. Multiply this event by 3 or 4 times per day every working day and it’s easy to see why these hallway conversations create massive bottlenecks in organizations. Everyone is talking but no one is deciding or acting. Organizational inertia sets in and the company’s rate of execution grinds to a halt. William Oncken Jr who founded a management coaching company developed a strategy to help managers handle monkeys. When faced with a monkey a report has five choices: Wait for instruction Ask for help Suggest an action and ask for permission Act but inform immediately Act and wait until the next 1 ⁄1 meeting to inform Oncken reasoned that the first two options are the worst because they encourage monkeys to propagate through hallway conversations like the one above. Instead managers should trust their reports to pursue options 3 through 5. Each of these three options requires a follow up meeting and a schedule of updates that should allocate enough time to discuss how best to deal with the monkey. Ultimately enforcing this practice builds trust among the team empowers team members to evaluate and resolve problems develops employees’ skills all while increasing a manager’s effectiveness a win-win outcome. Oncken’s technique for managing monkeys ensures continuity in business processes preventing managers from becoming bottlenecks and empowering reports to act quickly and effectively. It’s a good technique to maintain top execution speed.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-challenges-of-startups-serving-k12-education/,The challenges facing startups serving K-12 education,The challenges facing startups serving K-12 education Ariel Diaz wrote an insightful post in PandoDaily yesterday outlining the state of affairs in online education. Ariel touched on the history of education catalogued the problems of the status quo and pointed to a few innovative initiatives. Most Edu Innovation is Post-Secondary Reading the post and reflecting on the startups I’ve seen I concluded most of the innovation in education has occurred in post-secondary education instead of K-12 despite the fact that the K-12 market is about 50% larger in dollar terms than the post-secondary market. For example massively open online courses (MOOCs) like EdX and CourseEra target university students. The major for-profit education companies Capella and Phoenix serve university students. 2Tor/2U brings online education to offline colleges. And so on. But the same innovations aren’t present in K-12. The Two Limiting Factors for the K-12 Market Why is this? I think there are two limiting factors for serving the K-12 market. First there is a perception challenge. Any business that is too successful serving this market will be lashed by the public. “You’re making 30% EBIDTA margins on the backs of sixth-graders?!” It just doesn’t sit well with parents or tax-payers. Ultimately this reaction becomes a public policy issue - but again it’s just a perception issue. Second is a more tangible and addressable problem: it’s hard to sell to K-12 Small purchasing decisions for software are delegated to each of 14000 school districts. Depending on the regulations of the state every principal has the authority to authorize purchases under $25k unilaterally so I’m told. This discretionary market totals $350M but imposes significant costs of direct sales to principals. Anything greater requires budget approval RFP processes and immensely long sales cycles driven by committee approval - aka government sales. And startups can’t afford to compete and wait for these decisions to be made. K-12 Distribution Hacks As a result startups serving the K-12 market hope to reach teachers and students through consumer marketing channels like the web and mobile applications circumventing the traditional sales process. This is called the consumerization of education - a parallel to the consumerization of the enterprise. EdModo has demonstrated great success aggregating 10M users or thereabouts in this fashion. Perhaps they will serve as a conduit for other startups. Recently another channel has been created in NYC through a program called InnovateNYC. Steven Hodas formerly of the Princeton Review and Contnu a continuing learning company is helping edtech startups navigate the the NYC Department of Education. It’s an encouraging sign that large school districts are looking for innovation enabling startups to reach their target customers establish fit all while skirting the monolithic RFP processes. Won’t somebody please think of the children? I hope programs like InnovateNYC spread and I wish distribution channels like EdModo enable startups to reach empower and educate students in K-12. They could make a world of difference. Published 2012-11-01,Published 2012-11-01
http://tomtunguz.com/magic-numbers/,Sales Efficiency Benchmarks for SaaS Startups,Sales Efficiency Benchmarks for SaaS Startups One number investors use to benchmark SaaS startups across sectors and industries is sales efficiency. There are a handful of variants of this metric sometimes called the magic number but ultimately they all aim to provide some sense of the incremental revenue returned by sales and marketing investment. To make it more concrete if a startup invests $500k in marketing and sales this quarter and generates $1M in incremental revenue net of the cost to provide the service for the next 12 months the sales efficiency would be 2. The inverse of the sales efficiency is payback period. In the example above customer revenue reimburses sales and marketing costs in ½ year or about 6 months. Sales efficiency is a helpful high-level indicator. When sales efficiency figures fall below one and elongate pay-back periods it’s likely time to revisit sales and marketing techniques or explore up-sell and cross-sell. When these figures exceed one it’s likely time for a business to invest more capital into the sales and marketing efforts. Below are the sales efficiency benchmarks for the approximately 20 publicly traded SaaS companies calculated on an annual basis by years since founding. I used revenue x gross margin in these analysis rather than contribution revenue (revenue - COGS on a unit basis) because the public financials for these businesses don’t reveal unit economics. Thanks to @angusdav for making this point. The raw data is here. There is wide variance among them. LinkedIn is the upper outlier. I suspect their tremendous efficiency is driven by the network effect growth coupled to four products sold mostly through self-sign up (ads recruiting subscription product a sales subscription product and a consumer subscription). Most SaaS companies operate around the 0.8 mark meaning the business pays back the cost of the revenue and sales expense in the 5 quarters of the customer. Obviously contract durations and churn rates are critical components of these figures that are masked by the sales efficiency metric. The figure below smooths the magic numbers across these companies and removes the outliers. In a company’s early years rapid growth is driven through efficient sales and marketing spend. Over time as companies mature and reach market saturation the sales efficiency decreases lengthening payback periods for marketing and sales investment. The sales efficiency metric is a solid high level indicator of sales and marketing performance and a useful management tool. Published 2013-10-10,Published 2013-10-10
http://tomtunguz.com/quilted-social-network/,Piecing Together A Quilted Social Network: Does M&A Work for Social Nets?,Piecing Together A Quilted Social Network: Does M&A Work for Social Nets? In the past 12 months we’ve seen at least three major acquisitions of social networks by larger social networks. Facebook acquires Instagram. Google acquires Waze. Yahoo acquires Tumblr. And we are likely to see quite a few more given the dramatic growth of mobile messaging clients and social networks of all different kinds. While each of these acquisitions has their own particular motivations underpinning all three is user engagement. Engagement means activity which translates to advertising dollars. Additionally it is not unreasonable to suspect that all of these acquisitions will one day be used to bolster the parent companies own social network: Facebook and Google+. Yahoo’s plans are less clear. The success of these acquisitions boils down to one question: could a patchwork quilt of social networks succeed? How do you integrate two networks together without alienating the communities and destroying the value of the acquired company? Acquiring a social network is not like acquiring another consumer business. There is an additional variable that increases the integration complexity dramatically: the community. Each social network is a community with proprietary norms and manners. Often times these networks have very different cultures that don’t necessarily mix well together. Google’s YouTube acquisition was probably the first major social networking acquisition that ultimately became a success. By and large Google let the company operate independently in recognition of its dramatically different culture both internally and within the community melding the Google Plus and YouTube graphs over a few years. Facebook is following suit with the Instagram acquisition. In a next 18 to 24 months I am anticipating a flurry of social networking acquisitions. These might be gaming social networks mobile messaging clients professional networks. The key to the success of these acquisitions will be stitching the communities together.

http://tomtunguz.com/equipping-your-champions/,Founders Equip Your Champions,Founders Equip Your Champions As a founder you’re always selling. You’re selling yourself your team your product your company. But your pitch is likely missing one of two key components. A pitch needs to accomplish two goals to be effective. Most pitches solve the first but omit the second. First the pitch must convince the audience who might be investors employees recruits or customers of some premise. Second the pitch has to equip your champions now convinced of your argument to sell on your behalf. No enterprise software is ever bought unilaterally. No candidate is ever hired in isolation. No investment decision is ever made by one person in a VC firm. Whomever you’re pitching will need to convince another person or group of people. So your pitch should be structured to enable those champions to be effective by providing a be simple relatable and intriguing argument to build momentum within whatever organization is making the decision whether a VC fund a family or a business. How do you structure such an argument? One approach I’ve found that works well is a three pronged argument delivered in less than a minute. A change is inevitable that change implies a big opportunity and this is the right team or product to help us take advantage of that change. In your sales pitch ideally at the end of the pitch equip your champion with an argument like this. It will empower your champion to be more effective and help you close that sale.

http://tomtunguz.com/improving-your-communication-skills/,Fundamentals of communication,Fundamentals of communication Communication is essential to the success of every startup. Startup teams collaborate in product and engineering conversations in general management and in recruiting. Externally startups sell customers using marketing and sales. Startups also pitch investors during fundraising conversations. Clearly great communication makes demands of the audience. But effective communication is challenging. One of my favorite communication tools is a framework created by management guru Peter Drucker of three fundamentals: perception expectation and clear demand. Perception means understanding the audience: their worldview the language they use their motivations and their problems. Developing a deep perception of the audience often means listening which takes many forms including market research the conversations one-on-one conversations with reports and so on. Expectation means knowing the frame of mind of the audience - what they expect from a conversation. Violating expectations can be used as a sales technique to change a customer’s frame of mind when evaluating different products. While other PC makers fight a market share war based on price/performance Apple uses design to change the rules of engagement. Other times violating expectations can be more challenging for example delivering a negative feedback review to an employee with a different perception of his work. Clear demand is the ask. Once the audience’s perception and expectation are understood the communicator must understand her own goal of the conversation eg closing a sale or relaying ideas for how to improve an employee’s performance. The audience’s perception and expectation must be used to frame the demand for it to be effective. They are the keys to encoding the demand in an effective way. Frameworks like these can be a bit esoteric. But ultimately this is a tool to determine the best way to relay a message to an audience by first understanding them well then determining your goal of the conversation and last by framing the goal using the audience’s language and comparing or contrasting expectations.

http://tomtunguz.com/nine-box-matrix-hr/,Startup Best Practices 11 - The 9 Box Matrix Talent Model,Startup Best Practices 11 - The 9 Box Matrix Talent Model McKinsey developed the 9 Box Matrix in the 1970s to help GE prioritize investments across its 150 business units. Not all business units were equally attractive. Some should receive investments and others should be divested. The 9 Box Matrix evaluated business units on two dimensions: industry attractiveness and competitive strength of the business unit. At some point in the last 40 years Human Resources teams co-opted this model as a talent management tool and replaced the two industry axes with people specific ones: performance and potential as depicted above. Because the HR model has never been standardized there are quite a few variations in circulation. But the usage patterns are consistent. The main goal of the 9 Box Matrix is to categorize employees determine which to promote retain and invest in and which to reallocate. First the company categorizes all their employees into these buckets. Often it’s easiest for individual managers to do this individually starting with the stars as benchmarks and move down and across the matrix to fill out the rest. Next the management team meets to calibrate their categorizations. These calibrations ultimately inform compensation during annual performance reviews. Last the management team implements a talent plan which invests in the four top right boxes and includes training mentorship assigning new projects and retention compensation. In addition the plan should design a way to improve the performance of the low performing column either by managing that segment out of the company or reassignment to different roles. This matrix is often used as a tool to deliver performance evaluations indicating to employees where they fit in the scheme of things and what would be required of them to move about the matrix. The main challenge of the 9 Box Matrix presents to companies is assessing potential as objectively as possible. For example potential varies by role. The potential of an employee within an individual contributor role could be quite different from that within a management role. Like most frameworks the 9 Box Matrix is a simplifying tool for clarifying a process. If implemented well and customized to the needs of a startup the 9 Box Matrix can be used to develop an effective talent management plan. Published 2015-06-02,Published 2015-06-02
http://tomtunguz.com/proper-benchmarking/,The Best Way to Benchmark a SaaS Startup,The Best Way to Benchmark a SaaS Startup Following this week’s post Benchmarking HubSpot’s S-1 Josh and Nikos raised an interesting question on Twitter. What are the right ways to benchmark SaaS companies from their early days through IPO? I have always used years-since-founding as the time axis to compare companies because if I were a founder that’s how I might think about benchmarks. But after their comments I wondered if there were better ones. Some potential alternatives are: 1. Using time before/since-IPO for the time axis. 2. Grouping companies by ACV to compare growth rates 3. Grouping companies by Revenue at IPO to compare growth rates First let’s compare using years-since-founding to years before/after-IPO. Below I’ve plotted revenue growth for each of these two timelines. I’ve applied a basic predictive function (loess) which is marked in blue. In the first chart the predictor does a fairly good job of capturing the spirit of the data. There are one or two outliers growing at 200%+ but the curve matches the data set pretty well. When plotting the same data by year since IPO the data is much more dispersed. Consequently the predictor’s fit isn’t as good and the relationship isn’t as strong. In fact the years-since-founding predictor is twice as accurate recording an R^2 value a measure of line-fitting accuracy more than twice as big as the IPO-based x-axis. The argument for using years before/since IPO is that startups may be founded in tougher fundraising environments pursue a pivot or take some other scenic route to IPO which would delay their revenue growth when compared to other companies on a years-since-founding axis. But the data suggests this is a pretty infrequent occurrence. Nikos suggested using years since $1M ARR. Unfortunately since most companies only report 2-3 years of revenue before their IPO I’m able to calculate the year of $1M in ARR for only than 15% of companies in my dataset. Increasing the ARR figure to $10M captures about 50% of companies. But years-since-founding includes all the companies’ data points. In this case I believe more data is better. So I’m going to keep using years-since-founding because it’s a more consistent predictor and the data set is larger which ought to provide the better context for benchmarking. As for grouping companies in benchmark buckets rather than using the global median we could create buckets based on average customer value and determine if the growth rates at IPO are correlated. Above I’ve plotted growth rate in the year of IPO and the ACV bucket grouped by $25k increments. I’ve excluded a few outliers like Veeva and Medidata which have $1M+ ACVs. Unfortunately there’s no relationship between the value of a customer and a company’s growth rate at IPO - the data points are all over the map. This conclusion is a corollary to another analysis The Optimal Average Customer Value for SaaS Startups which suggested that multi-billion dollar SaaS companies can be built at any price point. Bucketing by ACV for revenue growth won’t shed much more insight into benchmarks than the raw median. Additionally there’s no clear correlation between ACV and Sales Efficiency as the plot above shows so bucketing by ACV wouldn’t make sense for evaluating the go-to-market effectiveness of a SaaS company. An alternative bucketing system for benchmarking might aggregate companies generating similar revenue levels at IPO. Above I’ve plotted the growth rates by Revenue Bucket from $0-300M in groups of $50M. Again it’s pretty clear there is no clustering which would indicate companies of a particular revenue size grow at different rates at IPO. There’s simply no pattern with this data. So I’m going to stick with the years since founding and a broad median to benchmark SaaS companies. Of course my goal with the S-1 analysis of HubSpot and Box and others in the future as well as all the benchmarking I publish is to help founders. If you have ideas for better ways to analyze or present the data please send me an email or tweet with ideas. I’d love to explore them. Published 2014-08-28,Published 2014-08-28
http://tomtunguz.com/trends-saas-fundraising-market/,The State of the SaaS Fundraising Market,The State of the SaaS Fundraising Market In a recent survey 40% of VCs pointed to SaaS as the startup sector most likely to be impacted by a market correction. There’s no question that the early stage SaaS founders are benefiting from substantial multiple expansion and pre-money valuation increases. But I was curious about how widespread aggressive investments are in software companies. As the data below shows the seed and Series A markets have been relatively stable but Series B rounds have seen a dramatic acceleration recently. 845 software companies raised seed rounds in 2013 a 40% increase from the year before. But in 2014 that figure fell by 25% to 653. Meanwhile Series As remained roughly constant from 2013 to 2014 and Series Bs rose by about 17%. In aggregate dollar terms the seed market remained flat at about $700M. The Series A market despite a 10% decline in deal counts grew by about 5% to $3B in 2014. The Series B market exploded to $6.5B last year growing by 66% annually after having grown by 77% the year before. The typical SaaS/software company raised a $1.1M seed round a $6.4M Series A and a $19M Series B. Each of these round sizes increased year over year. The Series B rounds increased by more than 40%. The deluge of dollars flowing into the venture market seems to be fueling Series B rounds primarily. Total investment has doubled driven primarily by larger rounds in roughly the same number of companies. In other words the early market leaders are rewarded handsomely with larger investments at better terms. This concentration of dollars in the Series B market driven by competition continues to drive valuations and multiples ever higher. And consequently if multiples were to suddenly recede it would be the Series B rounds that would likely see the greatest fall in size and investment pace. Published 2015-03-13,Published 2015-03-13
http://tomtunguz.com/performance-marketing-for-startups/,Performance marketing for startups with R,"Performance marketing for startups with R Performance marketing is a skill every startup should hone as a core competency as quickly as possible. Performance marketing creates a process where $1 invested in the business creates greater than $1 in output - a growth machine. Building a growth engine The goal of performance marketing is simple: to determine as precisely as possible the expected value of every current and potential user. This data enables the marketing team to know exactly how much they should be willing to pay to acquire the user. Or how much to incent a current user to upgrade. Or pursue some other action like invite a friend or share a tweet. The expected value of a customer changes dynamically as a function of the amount and kind of data a startup can collect about a user. The more data the better the expected value prediction. The challenge of course is building the system to calculate a user’s expected value. Problems like these are perfect for statistical analysis and machine learning. Because engineering is often the limiting factor in most startups and new features or bug fixes are top priority engineering marketing solutions is often under-prioritized. But building a simple generalized linear model isn’t incredibly complex. It can be done in three steps in R as I’ve been learning over the past few weeks. First gather the data To create a model we need to create a spreadsheet of customer behavior and data by column and save it as a csv. Here is a Google Doc of random data that might serve as a good start for a SMB SaaS company building a Yammer competitor. Second create a linear model in R After installing and configuring R building a model is trivial. It takes three lines of code. ac <- read.csv(""~/marketing/accountCohort.csv"") #load the data lm.ac = lm(formula = Revenue ~ . data = ac[2:7]) #build a model to predict revenue summary(lm.ac) #spits out the performance data of the model The first line ingests the data into R. The second line creates a basic multivariate linear model to predict the Revenue column using the six other variables. And the third spits out summary stats. Third evaluate the model I’ve copied a sample set of summary statistics below. The most important single number is in the second to last line: the Adjusted R-Squared which is 0.909 in this case. This number indicates the percent of variability my model predicts. Rule of thumb: this number needs to be above 0.9 to be a good predictor of revenue. This model clearly is a good predictor explaining 91% of the variance. The data in the coefficients table indicates which variables are good predictors of revenue with the number of asterixes at the end of the line. In this case Replies Created and Mobile Logins are terrible predictors. But all the others are quite good. Call: lm(formula = Revenue ~ . data = ac[ 1:15]) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -74.682 -0.020 0.018 0.018 32.994 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

In fact the challenging part in modeling isn’t actually telling the computer to build the model. Instead it’s finding the features (the columns of data) that accurately predict customer value. If my model hadn’t worked I would have needed to add other data to the csv and run the model again. With a tuned model it’s possible to predict the value of a given user (or millions of users) with one line of code R’s predict function. Once we know the revenue potential of a user we know how much we might be willing to pay to incent the user to perform certain actions. And we have built a framework for performance marketing.

http://tomtunguz.com/partnerships-for-startups-part-2/,Partnerships for startups: key deal terms,Partnerships for startups: key deal terms Yesterday’s post on distribution partnerships for startups elicited a few comments and questions about other important elements startups should consider when contemplating partnerships. I’ve listed a few other major partnership elements below. Qualifying the Partnership Quality of inbound traffic - As part of measuring the cost/benefit of a partnership it’s critical to understand quality of traffic/customers from a distribution partnership as @jamesreinhart pointed out. Ideally a startup should collect data on the performance of a distribution channel before entering into a long-term agreement with a partner. Conversion rates can vary widely by channel and lots of poor traffic isn’t worth the effort. Setting the Partnership on a Path to Succeed Internal dynamics play a huge role in the success of a partnership. With large scale or long term partnerships an internal champion whose job is on the line is essential for the success of the partnership. Additionally it’s critical to understand your potential partner’s motivations for working together and structuring the deal so that both parties are motivated to cooperate - and that incentives don’t diverge with time. Is this a check-the-box partnership or is this a strategic priority for your partner? Spifs or sales incentives If you are considering a distribution or sales channel partnership spiffs or sales promotion incentive funds ensure that sales teams working for your partner are paid to sell your product. Without spifs salespeople aren’t going to push your products because they make no extra money. Ideally your partner bankrolls the spifs. Or the costs are deducted from their portion of the revenue share. Marketing commitment is a critical focal point for distribution partnerships. Successful partnerships often have marketing performance metrics in the contract. This can be as high level as a dedicated marketing budget or as low level as guarantees on the number of customers/leads. Without any of these terms the partnership has the potential to flounder in obscurity. Deal Terms Remuneration - If the partnership requires engineering or additional service level agreements an up-front NRE (non-recurring engineering) fee from your partner is a common way to finance this work. Ideally a startup uses this NRE to finance and accelerate development on the product roadmap. NRE payments have seduced startups in the past (including one I worked for). Pursuing NRE as cash-flow at the expense of its roadmap transforms the startup into a consultancy - not the best outcome. Other forms of remuneration include revenue share - the split between the parties. And of course revenue guarantees. Guarantees tend to misalign incentives for partners. Whoever is guaranteed revenue can just put their feet up while the partner works hard to make money. Avoid them. Exclusivity is generally a very bad thing. Large companies try to enforce exclusivity to prevent their competition from working with a startup. Obviously such an overbearing constraint limits the size of a startup’s market. There are several effective strategies to negotiate against exclusivity: (1) offering exclusivity for a short period of a few months; (2) limiting the breadth of the exclusivity by explicit naming of competitors that startup cannot partner with; (3) framing the benefits of working with multiple partners as a benefit through shared data shared product features or some other mutual benefit; (4) framing the startup’s success as critical to the health of the partnership. Strategic investments - Sometimes partners like to invest into a startup as part of a partnership. They would like to participate in the upside of the success they engender. The cash infusion is alluring for the startup and typically strategic investments occur at better terms than those of the venture market. Strategic investments may grant a partner information rights - detailed knowledge typically shared only with the board. Knowing much about a startup provides the partner an effective right-of-first-refusal to purchase the company. Should an acquisition offer arrive from a third party your partner will be made aware. This skews the dynamics of an M&A process to the detriment of the startup. First the partner will have had extensive access to the company and its assets which means the partner can price the company better than any third party. A third party would have to be foolish to pay more than the partner. Second the partner will be made aware of incoming M&A interest and has an effective right-of-first-refusal. They may increase any third party’s bid by 5% and win the deal. Messy dynamics indeed. By and large I encourage only later stage companies (post-Series B) to consider strategic investments. At later stages the valuation a company can command limits the ownership a partner will purchase limits information rights and rids an M&A process of the effective ROFR dynamic. Breach - Both sides will want a clause that spells out the terms for breaking the partnership. The amount of notice size of damages process for restitution and so on should be explicit. Lastly it’s important to remember very partnership is different. Key points of negotiation vary widely. Having experienced counsel and a strong board is a big help in evaluating partnerships.

http://tomtunguz.com/impact-of-vc/,The Most Transformational Force in US Society,The Most Transformational Force in US Society Taxis. Food. Cars. Mobile phones. Communications. Banking. Healthcare. Entertainment. In the past ten years is there an industry startups haven’t upheaved? Startups have been the most transformational force in US society over the past 20 years. Uber has transformed the taxi industry reducing taxi rides in yellow cabs in San Francisco by 65% in 2 years. Hampton Creek has created an eggless mayonnaise that terrified the US egg industry. Android is arguably the most widely distributed consumer software in history. WhatsApp delivers 50% more messages than all global SMS volumes. As banks stopped lending after 2008 market place lenders like LendingClub and Prosper bloomed and originated $12B of loans in 2014. OneMedical and DoctorsOnDemand have transformed medical experiences for tens of thousands of people. Finally YouTube and Spotify and Pandora are shifting the media consumption patterns. More than 20% of US homes in 2015 will have cut the cord - and stopped paying for cable TV service. These particular changes to industries sum to a huge macroeconomic impact. Two professors at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business have quantified the impact of startups on the US economy and in particular on the public markets. 43% of US stocks are venture backed. They represent 57% of US market cap and employ 38% of the public company workforce. A handful of founders with a dream and a little bit of capital can change the world. And these teams are pushing society forward with greater magnitude greater frequency and broader impact than ever before. This data is reminder to set aside today’s concerns about short term undulations in the startup market and reflect on the accomplishments and the broader benefits startups have brought to society. And wonder at what new invention we’ll see that’s waiting for us around the corner. Published 2015-10-27,Published 2015-10-27
http://tomtunguz.com/moving-out-of-basement-ipo/,At Some Point You Have to Move Out of Your Parent's Basement,At Some Point You Have to Move Out of Your Parent's Basement When asked why he took Zendesk public this week CEO Mikkel Svane replied “At some point you have to move out of your parent’s basement.” It’s a witty quip with some truth to it. Evolving into a public company is a step for about 25-30 venture backed IT companies per year and it can be a worthwhile if strenuous journey. Zendesk went public in the midst of a 30% reduction in SaaS multiples in the public markets and the company has continued to perform well. Because of the demands of public market investors publicly traded companies must operate with greater discipline than most private companies. I don’t mean to imply that there aren’t terrifically well run private companies. Bloomberg provider of the eponymous financial information terminals generates roughly $10B annually in subscription revenues and is wildly profitable. But the demands of being a public company are stringent. Startups on the path to IPO must prepare for a year or more learning new disciplines in finance corporate communications and operations. In finance the company must develop an ability to forecast and achieve quarterly financial targets. The business must perform a thorough audit for several years in the past and implement financial controls on spending. And many of the business’ key metrics are exposed for the first time. Corporate communications must be organized and efforts coordinated to ensure statements don’t violate SEC disclosure rules for example. There also can be an emotional component to going public for a company. Unlike private companies who may perform a 409a valuation on the business every 6-12 months shares of publicly traded companies are marked to market every day. Sometimes companies bear large swings in share prices in short periods of time that increase and decrease the market cap of the business even though the core business hasn’t changed. And increasingly some public companies must wrestle with activist shareholders who according to a recent study increase a company’s focus on short term performance which can be a challenge when looking to manage a business with a long term time horizon. Incidentally this is the reason Google created a new type of share called Class C in 2014 that lacks voting rights so activists couldn’t influence the company. There can be substantial benefits to going public. The news disciplines learned can lead to a better run organization. Employee option/share liquidity rewards early employees and provides a new and enticing compensation tool for recruitment. But like moving out of the basement there are some new things to learn and some growing pains too. Published 2015-07-15,Published 2015-07-15
http://tomtunguz.com/suites-point-solutions/,The Increasing Fragmentation of SaaS,The Increasing Fragmentation of SaaS According to ChiefMarTec in 2015 there are 1875 marketing technology companies up from 947 last year. If the number of marketing software companies is any indication there is a huge expansion in the number of SaaS companies in almost every segment including sales tools engineering productivity finance and human resources. This fragmentation trend has been happening for quite some time. In the old model of software procurement companies would call one of the large software monoliths (Oracle SAP IBM etc) and negotiate an enterprisewide license for a software suite to serve the majority of their departments. These suite offerings promised simplified negotiation and procurement a single integrated platform with free data interchange across departments and one point of support. But this promise was never fulfilled. For example according to a recent study by Panorama Consulting Solutions the average ERP implementation requires 16 months to deploy and 20% of them are considered failures. The alternative which is the fragmented market of today enables teams to purchase best-of-breed point solutions try them and quickly cycle through all the different offerings until they find the best one for their needs. This change in purchasing behavior is happening broadly across SaaS. If you speak to a VP of Sales a fast-growing startup you often hear them talk about their sales stack the collection of different software their account executive views. It’s not just CRM that salespeople use anymore but sales orchestration lead generation configure price quote software and so on. The marketing team also has their proprietary software stack with marketing automation lead scoring attribution and many other categories. So does human resources: applicant tracking employee engagement goal setting… These department specific software stacks serve their customers much better than a single suite ever could because each team in each company can select precisely the products that offer the features that meet their specific needs. and if requirements should change it’s as simple as canceling a subscription and starting with another product. Data mobility enables these department software stacks to exist. While the monolithic software suite never fulfilled their promise of easy data movement across different applications point solutions do because many of them have robust APIs which allow bilateral integrations and the enterprise middleware companies like Segment and Tray and Zapier. Plus these integrations scale unlike the bespoke data exchange of suites. Integrate once with Salesforce and all customers benefit. There are of course downsides to the highly fragmented software ecosystem. It becomes more more difficult for individual vendors to differentiate in a sea of competitors. Startups may find it increasingly challenging to win a disproportionate share of the market. In addition best-of-breed solutions have to compete suites who often discount aggressively. For example every independent marketing automation company has to compete with Salesforce offering Pardot to all their customers. But these are tractable challenges in the market that values piecing together an optimal software stack. At least for the moment I expect to see further and further fragmentation in the software landscape enabled by APIs. Published 2015-07-07,Published 2015-07-07
http://tomtunguz.com/management-design-patterns/,The Missing Startup Design Pattern,The Missing Startup Design Pattern Earlier this week I chatted with a friend of mine who has founded an incredibly successful business which he and his co-founder have been scaling impressively. I asked him about his biggest learning over the past few years. He said before having started his company and having built the team he perceived management as a Band-Aid as a fix for something wrong in the organizational design communication or day-to-day operations of the company. Over time he has come to believe that manangement is the only way of growing his startup. But it’s what he said next that really resonated with me. “Management has Design Patterns.” In engineering there are an infinite number of ways of solving a problem. Some are quite clearly better than others. The best ways are codified into Design Patterns. Engineers employ design patterns to accelerate development by leveraging the work and insight of others. In addition design patterns improve team communication because the codebase adheres to standard way of doing things making the code is easy to understand. For these reasons most engineers study design patterns both in college and independently. Many keep a copy on their desks for reference. Just like engineers managers have created a set of design patterns which are called best practices. When managing a team there are an infinite number of ways to guide and influence motivate and reward that team. But some ways are clearly better than others. For those who come from engineering backgrounds it’s rare for us to have learned about these management best practices. I first began to hear about them at Google when I was an Associate PM. Each APM spoke with a management coach twice a week and I was fortunate to have a seasoned and effective coach. She gave me frameworks for delivering difficult feedback structuring groups motivating teams and obtaining team committment to drive success. Just having a mental model for how to speak with team members gave me confidence. I wasn’t a very good manager but the best practices help me become a little bit better. The most effective engineering teams leverage all the learning and tools available to them to build high quality software efficiently. Similarly the most successful startups use both engineering design patterns and management best practices to build high quality well-functioning teams to grow the business.

http://tomtunguz.com/monthly-burn-benchmarks/,How Much Cash Should Your Startup Burn?,How Much Cash Should Your Startup Burn? Bill Gurley and Fred Wilson have focused on burn rates as an important topic for startups. The immediate question that follows this commentary is: How much does the typical startup burn throughout its life? And what is a “risky” burn rate for a company? I use a rule of thumb to evaluate the burn rate of a Series A startup. I multiply the number of employees by about $10-12k depending on the location of the company. For example Bay Area salaries are higher than most other places. If a startup’s current burn rate substantially exceeds the this heuristic I ask why. But like many others this shortcut isn’t rooted in analysis. Using a basket of about 60 publicly traded consumer and SaaS companies I aggregated the net income patterns by years-since-founding. I eliminated outliers to concentrate on the patterns of the “typical” public startup. The bar chart above shows the median monthly net income by sector and years-since-founding. A few patterns emerge from the data. Consumer Companies Consumer companies tend to burn more cash in the earlier years than SaaS companies. This is likely because some consumer companies in the basket delay revenue until achieving large-scale consumer adoption. As consumer companies begin to weave their revenue models into their businesses net income patterns decline progressively through to year 10 at which point the business nears profitability. The median consumer public startup doesn’t exceed $1M in monthly burn rate at any point during its life. SaaS Companies In SaaS companies the burn rate is either equal to or smaller than consumer companies in years 2 and 3. In year 4 the paths diverge. SaaS companies presumably having achieved product market fit quickly hire large sales and marketing teams. Sales teams require a certain amount of time to learn the product the sales pitch and build a book of business to eventually achieve quota. During the intervening few months the company pays a carrying cost of the sales salaries that are not yet offset by bookings or revenue thereby depressing net income. The median public SaaS company burns $1M or less per month for the first four years. As the business scales this figure jumps to about $1.5M at which point the company goes public. Having raised additional capital and subject to additional scrutiny of public investors burn falls again to sub-$1M per month. Of course the medians don’t express the variance within the data. I’ve plotted a box plot by sector of the same data. The median values are marked by white lines in the boxes. The 25% and 75% percentile values are the edges of the boxes and the extremes of the whiskers indicate the 5% and 95% percentiles. Again I’ve omitted the outliers. Now that we’ve established some benchmarks let’s return to the question of the “risky” burn rate. There is no precise answer for every company as to what a risky burn rate and what a conservative burn rate might be. But there are a few factors to consider. First the ability of the team and the business to continue to raise capital are the most important factors. Part of this ability lies within the team and the team’s ability to position and sell the story of the business. Another component is the market’s receptivity to the story given the financial conditions of the market which is harder to gauge and difficult to predict. Second the current runway or months-of-cash remaining as compared to the timing of the next milestone. Ideally companies count 6 to 9 months of cash on their balance sheets when they attain the target milestones to raise their next round. Third the unit economics of the business matter a great deal. If the unit economics of a startup are strong that’s a great leading indicator to finance growth and increase burn. If the company hasn’t yet achieved contribution break even then it’s often prudent for the business to reduce spend until the math is proven out. One of the main responsibilities of the management team and the board is cash management and financial planning. Understanding the impact of the business’s burn rate is an essential component of this responsibility. Benchmarks like the ones above can help but should be used in conjunction with milestone planning for fundraising. Note: I analyzed net income not free cash flow for startups mostly because the data is more readily available. But for certain businesses FCF can be a better metric to evaluate true cash burn than net income. Published 2014-09-29,Published 2014-09-29
http://tomtunguz.com/so-what-if-its-a-bubble/,Why the Bubble Question Doesn't Matter,Why the Bubble Question Doesn't Matter “Is there a bubble?” is a question that seems to be asked every day. But it’s the wrong question - in fact it’s an unimportant question. Maybe there is a bubble. Maybe there isn’t. Instead of asking the question let’s just presume we are in a bubble. Then the far more important debate surfaces: given the bubble how should a team manage a startup differently? If I were to survey entrepreneurs and board members I presume I would hear something like this list: First a startup must think long term. No matter the uncertainties and the fluctuations of the market the business must survive. To survive a startup must build a differentiated product that customers want to use and buy. The company must offer the best product in the market. Second the company must manage its cash effectively. The business must achieve profitable unit economics; only invest substantial dollars in marketing efforts with positive return on investment; curtail unnecessary expenses; collect cash from customers religiously; maintain an upside and a downside plan that ensures the business enough cash to survive in the downside case. Third the startup should only hire the right people and grow the team when justified by the needs of the business and the incremental revenue possibilities. Fourth the startup must mitigate churn. Companies ought to build the best customer success organizations structure pricing plans properly plan the right product roadmap cultivate a diversified customer base and ensure customers achieve positive return on their investment. Fifth the founders must raise capital opportunistically to amass a war-chest large enough to achieve their vision; and position the business so that it can always be in a good position to raise capital or cut costs to achieve profitability quickly should the need arise. This means running an efficient go-to-market organization. In all likelihood there are other ideas that would surface from such a conversation. But reading through the list you’ll notice panic isn’t among the ideas. In fact there’s nothing crazy at all in this list. All of these activities are things great startups do anyway in any environment: think long term manage cash well build the best product hire the right team and provide customers value. No one knows if there’s a bubble or if/when our presumed bubble will pop. The best we can do is build startups using sound principles and disciplined decision-making with the aim of building sustainable defensible businesses. Whether or not we’re in a bubble shouldn’t change those core tenets. So if we’re abiding by those principles the question of are we in a bubble doesn’t really matter.

http://tomtunguz.com/salesforces-disruptor-wont-be-a-crm-company/,Salesforce’s Disruptor Won’t Be A CRM Company,Salesforce’s Disruptor Won’t Be A CRM Company For sales people social proof is one of the most powerful forms of influence as Robert Ciadini proved in his seminal book on the topic. It’s no secret that the best leads are referrals. Second best is the friend who is a customer in common: “Oh Peter chose Salesforce for his CRM. Maybe I should consider them too.” Social proof confers the trust of a relationship to the salesperson improving close rates. But social proof is entirely absent from sales software. Salesforce which generates $3B in revenue and has amassed a market cap of $25B is the most successful CRM software of our era. But neither of the two innovations Salesforce brought to market CRM delivered over the web and a bottoms-up sales process help salespeople close more business. In fact if you speak to Salesforce users many will complain the data entry slows them down. The startup that disrupts Salesforce will be worth much much more because instead of simply recording leads and sales the next CRM will create business for its customers leveraging social proof. It won’t be enough for a CRM to inform a salesperson which potential customer to call the way Salesforce’s task list operates today. This new CRM will scour the web to find potential customers discover points of social proof with potential customers increasing close rates and finally record the transactions in the system. Today Salesforce only solves the last problem which is by far the least valuable of the three. Imagine if you could log into a system each morning see a list of potential customers understand how you are connected to those people through friends of friends work colleagues college affiliations common interests. Once on the phone with a prospect you might inform them of friends who use your product or even competitors. Your close rates would skyrocket because of the social proof at your disposal. To call this software customer-relationship management would be describing only a fraction of the value such a product would create. Salesforce’s disruptor won’t be a CRM company. It will be something much much bigger. Published 2013-02-14,Published 2013-02-14
http://tomtunguz.com/employee-productivity-patterns-saas/,The Employee Productivity Patterns of Billion Dollar SaaS Companies,The Employee Productivity Patterns of Billion Dollar SaaS Companies SaaS companies are marvelous businesses. They are more predictable than most other kinds of companies and in addition they demonstrate leverage from technology. The best SaaS companies are able to build strong brands develop scalable products and hire teams to bring those products to market effectively. To show the power of the convergence of these forces I’ve analyzed the employee productivity patterns of the 50+ publicly traded SaaS companies. The chart above shows the headcount growth of the median publicly traded SaaS company from year four through year ten of the company’s life. During those six years the typical business grows from 184 to 944 employees adding about 100 each year. During those same six years the revenue productivity of those employees nearly triples from $78k in revenue per employee per year to more than $200k. The second chart shows the magic of leverage. As a SaaS company matures the business builds a strong brand which attracts more business develops internal sales and marketing processes to convince and win new customers and serves these customers with scalable technology. The multiplicative effect of headcount growth and improving productivity fuels the growth of the business. Consequently revenue increases from $14M to about $200M. There is some variance of course in these figures as we’ve analyzed in the past. Best in class companies like Salesforce and FinancialEngines are able to achieve more than $300k in revenue per employee per year but these medians serve as good benchmarks.

http://tomtunguz.com/software-enabled-marketplaces/,Free SaaS Enabled Marketplaces - A Novel Go-To-Market for Software Startups,Free SaaS Enabled Marketplaces - A Novel Go-To-Market for Software Startups Traditional software was initially sold by perpetual license. Then in the mid-00s with the advent of SaaS the market shifted to per seat per year pricing. And simultaneously freemium marketing strategies blossomed. Freemium companies provide software for free temporarily to entice users to try and use the product. Eventually these users cross a threshold and convert to a paid subscriber. This threshold can be based on number of people using the product (Expensify) number of documents signed in a month (HelloSign) or additional product features needed by users (Yammer). Today we’re seeing a new segment of the SaaS ecosystem move to free - the SaaS Enabled Marketplace (SEM). SaaS Enabled Marketplaces like Contently charge for both software (content management tools) and access to a market place (of content producers). Chris Dixon has a catch phrase for this type of business: come for the tool stay for the network. The free SaaS enabled market places (FSEM) of which Zenefits is the most prominent also build software and provide access to a market place. However unlike traditional SEMs companies FSEMs never charge for their software preferring to generate revenue from transactional or lead generation fees from their market place. Zenefits provides free benefits software to businesses and generates revenue from commissions when employers or employees buy insurance plans through the platform. This go-to-market strategy benefits FSEMs in three important ways. First good free software spreads quickly enabling rapid customer acquisition. In competitive markets or when pursuing customers that have been expensive to acquire free software creates a clear and often defensible competitive distribution advantage. Incumbents often can’t compete with free without cannibalizing their current business. Second this free software builds an important data asset. FSEMs software captures information about the user and often other key data like company size activity and growth rates which can be used to inform a market place. After all on the other side of the market place suppliers want to pursue particular types of customers. The data from the free app can also be used to prioritize the leads for the FSEM’s inside sales teams among other things. Third the software usage can be used to bootstrap a market place and develop liquidity. Once a market place has developed liquidity it’s very difficult to unseat. Most market places have winner take all dynamics meaning the business’ position is all but unassailable. But FSEMs implicitly trade great distribution and data assets for an arguably less attractive revenue model which has smaller gross margins and often less predictability. Unlike traditional SaaS companies which charge subscription fees for software and operate between 70-80% gross margins FSEMs’ primary revenue streams often are lead generation fees for providing business to the other side of a market place. These fees can range widely but often generate around 30% gross margins. Additionally transactional revenue isn’t as predictable as subscription which for SaaS companies with 12 month annual subscriptions is contractually guaranteed. FSEMs can be incredibly disruptive businesses. They can grow exceptionally quickly erect substantial defensive moats and jumpstart marketplaces. While we won’t see FSEMs in every category of SaaS because only a small subsegment of software categories can benefit from a market place where they do take hold FSEMs will be powerful forces to be reckoned with.

http://tomtunguz.com/building-a-customer-acquisition-machine/,A Framework for Maximizing Startup Marketing Effectiveness,A Framework for Maximizing Startup Marketing Effectiveness At a board meeting last week one of the VPs of Marketing I’m lucky to work with presented a brilliantly simple way of explaining the evolution of a startup’s marketing tactics. I’ve drawn a diagram of the idea above which borrows heavily from McKinsey’s 3 horizons. Startups have many different marketing options at their disposal: SEO/SEM print radio TV mail affiliate content marketing…The list goes on and on. Faced with this litany of options how does a startup maximize their marketing effectiveness? Initially a startup’s goal is to find a channel with profitable unit economics (where the cost-of-customer-acquisition is less than the gross margin over some lifetime-value estimate) with as small an investment as possible to minimize burn. To find that viable acquisition channel requires lots of testing so fast testing cycles of different advertising tactics are paramount to determining the viability of a channel. Fast iteration cycles tend to be at the bottom-of-the-funnel when potential customers are at the point of purchase. Typically when startups get started startups experiment and pursue success in direct-response advertising including cost-per-click cost-per-lead cost-per-install and other forms of performance advertising. These channels can offer quite a bit of volume and can enable a company to grow to some scale. But as the startup begins to saturate the marketing channel the unit economics of the channel stabilize or potentially worsen. Next the startup begins to expand to more and more direct response advertising channels and pursue the same strategy. At a certain point the marginal returns of continued investment in bottom-of-the-funnel customer acquisition strategies begins to winnow. Before such a point occurs the startup should move up the funnel and begin to experiment with middle-of-the-funnel tactics where potential customer leads are educated and nurtured. Moving up the funnel implies addressing a broader universe of new customers at the expense of longer customer-conversion times and a decreased ability to measure the effectiveness of a dollar of marketing spend. But having built the systems and processes to measure the effectiveness of performance advertising a startup is in a much better position to evaluate middle-of-the-funnel advertising like content marketing lifecycle-marketing and others. Last having built the middle-of-the-funnel channels and begun to measure and tune these channels then enables the startup to move to address the top-of-the-funnel to build broad awareness of the company with products like billboards radio and TV etc. Again because the startup has instrumented the middle and bottom of the funnel the impact of top-of-the-funnel can be measured to a certain extent. Said another way at its outset a startup should focus on customers who will convert in 30 days focus on those channels and master them. Once a playbook has been established then a startup should aim to reach ever broader audiences with riskier (or less measurable) channels first in the middle of the funnel and then the top of the funnel. In this way a startup can match the growth needs and the predictability needs of each type of marketing channel with the needs of the startup namely the ability to grow and also demonstrate compelling unit economics and repeatable growth the cornerstone of successful fundraising.

http://tomtunguz.com/how-to-make-pretty-charts/,How to Make Pretty Charts,"How to Make Pretty Charts When I first started writing I wondered how I could make charts like those in the Economist or in the New York Times the beautifully formatted ones. After some research I figured out how. And this post explains how you can do it too. Many data scientists use a free open-source language called R. It’s a great tool for processing data and I use R to process all the data for this blog. You can download it here. Alternatively many people use RStudio an editor which makes R much easier to use. To make these charts I use a library written by Hadley Wickham called ggplot2. ggplot2 has all kinds of charts: area line bar etc. You can see all of them here That all sounds much more complicated than it is. To make the chart above which is a point chart of random data just download RStudio create a new file and paste the code below into it. Then hit the run button and you should have it.

Mina my partner Jamie and I got to know each other about 10 years ago at Google where we were associate product managers all working in Marissa Mayer’s APM program. Since Google Mina has done some amazing things. In particular Mina was Uber’s first PM. She joined when the company numbered about 20 people and stayed through until the employee base reached many thousands. Mina introduced surge pricing built the on-boarding software for new drivers and managed the releases of the key products of the company including UberX. Needless to say Mina is an expert in product management for on-demand companies and market places. And of course she has quite a few experiences managing the stress of hyper-growth. Mina joins Jeremy Gordon former VPE of Twitter Javier Soltero founder and CEO of Acompli Andy Rubin creator of Android Arthur van Hoff co-author of Java and founder of Jaunt among many EIRs who we’ve been lucky to work with.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-part-they-dont-tell-you-about-team-building/,The Part They Don’t Tell You About Startup Team Building,The Part They Don’t Tell You About Startup Team Building At Google the director of my team repeated a management mantra to us quite often. “Manage yourself out of a job; make yourself redundant” she would say. “Empower your people and then get out of the way.” Our director was a terrific team builder. Before Google she founded a startup where she learned to build a company. When she told us her mantra she was sharing her learnings with us. Company builders sow the seeds of a team cultivate each teammate promote a leader from within and then step away after the team has become capable of running itself. They are force multipliers. Where there was nothing a self-sustaining organization has blossomed. It’s a beautiful thing. But no one talks about what happens after that process is completed. Watching company-building first-hand at a few portfolio companies I’ve listened to founders and managers explain the challenges of being in this situation. Once a leader has managed himself out of a job he has to be ready to find another. Being ready means a few things. First it means letting go ceding pride of authorship and ownership. Someone else is running the team and making the decisions. Second it means asking two introspective questions and answering them honestly: “What does the business need next?” and “What am I uniquely capable of achieving for the business?” Last it means completely changing daily priorities and a work schedule to focus on the new task at hand the one thing the business needs next that the person can uniquely provide. It’s no small change. Often the next problem is apparent and the transition is seamless easy and logical. But sometimes these transitions stress team builders enormously. Sometimes they create crises of identity or confidence: I used to run this team; now what do I do? Sadly sometimes it means finding work elsewhere. Despite the stresses created after the process is completed managing yourself out of a job is a fine way of summarizing an ethos of team building. But we have to be prepared for the sometimes difficult transition to the next project after we’ve made ourselves redundant. Published 2013-08-30,Published 2013-08-30
http://tomtunguz.com/how-close-to-2000/,How Similar is the Fundraising Environment Today to 2000?,How Similar is the Fundraising Environment Today to 2000? In Q2 2015 VC investment totaled $16.7B about a 66% of the $28B deployed in Q2 2000 according to a new report. And the trends shows no sign of stopping. A big contributor to this growth are nontraditional investors including mutual funds and hedge funds which now account for approximately 40% of dollars invested. And while the market is similar to the dotcom era in some regards it is substantially different in others. Amazingly each of the last four quarters of venture investment from Q3 2014 to Q2 2015 are in the top 10 all-time for venture capital investment. However the number of investments per quarter is about half of 2000. Combined with the chart above this implies that fewer startups are raising substantially larger rounds. It also implies that there are probably winner-take-most or similar dynamics in many different industries. Category leaders stockpile massive war chests creating a defensive moat. Sure enough the data shows that the average investment size in Q2 2015 is $14.7M exceeding the $13.1M figure of Q2 2015. In other words the typical round raised by startups has never been larger. Looking at this data by stage average series A investments and series B investments are the largest ever been at about $10M and $20M respectively adjusted for inflation. Later rounds are approaching all-time highs but have not eclipsed them yet despite about ten $1 billion plus equity raises in the last 12 to 18 months. As average investment sizes have increased and valuations with them investors have moved earlier in response. Unlike the dotcom era this time series Bs and series Cs have remained constant in number while series As have doubled since 2005. Interestingly seed round volumes have not increased substantially but this may be an artifact of the way the NVCA collects its data. When looking at the data by sector we see that consumer products and services and financial services companies raise on average the largest rounds. Financial services companies on average in Q2 raised north of $30 million. This is largely skewed by handful of outliers. Consumer products and services also reach close to $20 million. As the amount of money investors pile into startups starts to reach the levels of the dotcom era the data shows that while there are some similarities there also some meaningful differences. This time investors are pursuing series As more aggressively than they have previously likely to mitigate the increasing valuations in the market. There is also substantially more concentration in the smaller set of startups. So investors are focusing on the perceived winners of categories. Published 2015-07-16,Published 2015-07-16
http://tomtunguz.com/2014-founder-compensation-trends/,Why Series A Startup Founder CEO Equity Stakes Have Grown 40% in Five Years,Why Series A Startup Founder CEO Equity Stakes Have Grown 40% in Five Years The median equity stake of US venture-backed post-Series A CEO has increased from 15% to 21% a 40% increase in five years. This trend is also manifested in Series Bs but as the chart above shows post-Series C and D total founder/CEO equity positions have remained constant. Meanwhile the equity stakes of founding VP of Engineering and VP of Product have remained relatively constant throughout the same five year period across all stages of company. Founder stakes start high and then typically decrease over time as founding teams sell equity stakes in their company in exchange for venture capital investment and also granting shares to hire candidates and retain existing employees. As valuations have increased in Series A companies founders may be able to sell less of their company in order to raise the same amount of money. Of course investors do tend to have ownership thresholds which constrains this trend to some extent. But valuation expansion isn’t the most important trend driving this rise in founder-CEO equity stakes. If it were VPE and VPP equity stakes would also see a relative rise over time because each of the three is a founder and the reduction in dilution would benefit each proportionately. Instead I suspect the data is showing a rise in the number of single founder companies because CEO stakes are increasing but the equity positions of VPP and VPE haven’t risen in tandem. Aside from valuation the major determinant of a founder/CEO’s equity stake is the number of founders in the company. The fewer the number of founders the greater the equity stakes for each founder. There is some subset of companies within the data which only have a founding CEO. Another cohort has a founding CEO and VPE. Another group has a founding CEO VPE VPP and so on. All those cohorts are mixed in the chart and the data I use doesn’t specify the number of founders within the company. I don’t know of any data anecdotal or quantitative that shows success rate is correlated to number of founders and I wouldn’t believe such an argument. Redpoint has invested in companies with a solo founders a duo of founders and a trio founders. We’ve seen success with all these types of founding teams. Rather this increase in single-founder startups is likely a by-product of the growth in entrepreneurship in the US. Individuals enamored with an idea take it upon themselves to start a company to create the change they wish to see in the world. And that’s a very good thing.

http://tomtunguz.com/customer-segmentation/,The Importance of Segmentation for Your SaaS Startup,The Importance of Segmentation for Your SaaS Startup Are you a Barry Jill Buzz Angel or a Devil? This is the question Best Buy store managers posed each time a potential customer walked into one of its stores when the company decided to segment its customer base in 2005. Barrys are high-income family men. Jills are soccer moms. Buzzes are gadget lovers. Angels are the best most-profitable customers and buy new products at full price. Devils on the other hand erode Best Buys’ profits because they use coupons find the best deals and return products frequently. After launching this segmentation restructuring its stores to meet the needs of these segments and focusing on the profitable segments Best Buy’s revenue increased 8% an impressive figure for a retailer. As your startup scales customer segmentation can become an important tool for the entire company just like it was for Best Buy. Personas anchor product design and development marketing and sales and even customer success to tangible user archetypes. Personas define the company’s strategy of which customers to pursue and which not to. Best Buy’s segmentation unites two classic segmentation types needs-based and profitability based segmentation. The Jills Barrys and Buzzes in the Best Buy example are need-based segments. The canonical enterprise segmentation of Small Business Mid-Market and Enterprise used by many SaaS startups fits this pattern. But there is another important customer taxonomy: segmentation by profitability. Angels and Devils are profit-based divisions for Best Buy. More common in industries with little growth profitability segmentation can be a powerful tool to help startups focus on the right customers to grow more profitably. Profitability segments are first-pass filters. They answer the question which customers should I be acquiring? Which are the most profitable for the business? While they may be less attractive unprofitable customers need not be be shunned; Best Buy didn’t turn away the Devils. Instead Best Buy crafted pricing mechanisms to convert Devils into profitable customers by charging a restocking fee and upselling much higher margin products such as extended product warranties. The same idea holds for SaaS products. For the lowest price customers prioritizing sales leads tiering customer support charging for customer success may radically change the business’ cost to serve and unit profitability. Lemons become lemonade. The second-pass filter needs-based segments divide the most profitable user segments into personas for the go-to-market teams. They identify the company’s core customer define personas and enable the business focus on these customers’ needs first. Developing the right segments is critical. Wikipedia has a great list on the criteria for determining whether a segment is a useful one: is segment measurable addressable stable and consistent? But the most basic is the first. Is there enough data? Segmentation is a powerful tool to be employed by startups once the customer base becomes large enough which probably means at least a few hundred customers. At that point the business will have enough data to divide the customer base into meaningful slices. Then it’s time to analyze the data affirm the conclusions with user research and then employ the segments in product development sales and marketing. One more bit of advice on segments: choose your personas’ names wisely. A moniker like Devil doesn’t endear the customer to your business. Published 2014-12-15,Published 2014-12-15
http://tomtunguz.com/state-seed-market-q4-2014/,Why It's a Great Time to Raise a Seed Round,Why It's a Great Time to Raise a Seed Round Seed investments are booming. According to Crunchbase data the number of seed rounds in US companies has grown by 10x in 6 years from 200 per year to more than 2200 in 2013. This is driven by the expansion of the institutional seed investor and the tripling of seed stage capital available to founders. With all that capital entering the market seed round sizes have also increased. The top quartile seed rounds have expanded by 44% in 8 years and by 75% since 2008. The 75% percentile seed round in 2014 totals $1.3M. Coincidentally this seed round size maximizes a seed stage’s company odds of a follow-on Series A. The expansion in seed investments spans the top 3 states for venture capital (CA MA and NY) which collectively account for 70% of seed investment dollars raised. Today Californian seed-stage startups raise 8.2x as much in aggregate as they did in 2008. Massachusetts startups have increased their seed investment by 20x and NYC companies have raised more than 14x more seed dollars. Capital is plentiful. Startup infrastructure costs continue to plummet App stores and other novel channels of distribution are flourishing. At this point a startup’s most challenging task aside from finding the right idea is recruiting and retaining a great team. But if you needed another push to found a startup just take a look at the data. Published 2014-11-06,Published 2014-11-06
http://tomtunguz.com/class-of-2014-ipos/,The 2014 Class of SaaS IPOs,The 2014 Class of SaaS IPOs 2014 has been a great year for SaaS companies. By my count 9 of them will have gone public. Meanwhile SaaS companies in both the public and private markets continue to fetch premium valuations. To illustrate the rapid appreciation in the value of these SaaS companies I’ve plotted the share price by round of each business. The color bars in the chart represent Series A B… through to IPO. The last bar called Q414 is yesterday’s share price (if the company has already IPO’ed). A few interesting trends emerge from the data: First the two last IPOs New Relic and Hortonworks both have priced their IPO at below their last round price. On paper the investors participating in the Series F of New Relic and the Series D of Hortonworks seem to be underwater. Second once these SaaS companies trade in the public markets they pop. The median appreciation in share price from IPO to today is 52%. The average is 95%. In other words the shares of these companies are worth 50-100% more than at IPO. I’ve plotted the median share price by round below: If the same patterns hold true for New Relic and Hortonworks then the last investors in those businesses should see positive returns from their investments. I wonder if Hortonworks will see the same pop given the gross margins (35%) are substantially below SaaS norms of 65-70% but we’ll know very soon. Third the average SaaS IPO in 2014 raised 4 rounds of capital. Two companies Tableau and Veeva raised only 2. On the other side of the spectrum New Relic and Workday raised 6. The 2014 Class of SaaS IPOs show there are many different ways of building a business. New Relic and Zendesk are pure product-driven sales companies. Workday and Hortonworks deliver their products with large amounts of professional services revenue. Veeva and Tableau have demonstrated exceptional capital efficiency. If this data is any indication and of course setting aside the survivorship bias of this type of analysis SaaS should remain a very compelling place for founders to build companies and for investors to invest.

http://tomtunguz.com/two-step-value-prop/,Successful SMB SaaS Companies Have a 2 Step Value Proposition,Successful SMB SaaS Companies Have a 2 Step Value Proposition On first glance SMB SaaS companies those who sell Software-as-a-Service to small to medium businesses may seem like any other software company. But they are quite a different breed. It’s not just the sales process that differs from traditional software. The entire business has be built differently. So must the product. And typically these products have a 2 step value proposition. SMB SaaS companies sell to a radically different market than enterprise software companies. See the table below. The average traditional enterprise software company sells to firms with 3300 employees whose average payroll is $160M annually. In the US there are only 17500 of these firms. On the other hand SMB SaaS companies sell to firms with 10 employees and $400k in annual payroll. There are about 5.8M of these firms in the US. Encouragingly the market size for enterprise software is roughly equal to the market size for the SMB market: about 57M potential seats in each. Of course the true number depends on the market segment: sales HR payroll expense management etc. But these two markets require very different approaches. Company Size Firms Employees Payroll in $k Employees per Firm Payroll per Firm in $k 1 to 500 5749797 56281503 2084818973 10 363 Greater than 500 17509 58228123 2770726266 3326 158246 Source: US Census SMB SaaS companies need to reach and market to 1000 times more companies than their enterprise counterparts. Obviously this requires a new sales process. Typically this sales process leads with a product which excites users and triggers word of mouth sharing and blog posts and news articles. Direct sales aren’t profitable at this scale. Instead mass media channels must be used: press mobile app stores (iOS & Android) web app stores (Chrome Google Apps Intuit and Force). It means every customer support rep must handle hundreds to thousands of customers per year instead of tens of customers. Customer support becomes an inside sales team. They drive upsells and cross-sells instead of a sales team. In short the whole organization must be different. Even the product development cycle is different. Without enterprise customers there are no enterprise commitments. No promises to customers about releasing features on particular dates or paid upgrade cycles. It’s all subscription. Take it or leave it. If the product has to be so different what seems to be the key to success? The most successful SMB SaaS products typically offer a 2 step value proposition: an initial value proposition to the end user and a longer term value proposition to a manager/decision maker. Take one of our companies Expensify which offers simple expense reports to the end user just by scanning receipts. To the controller/VP of Finance Expensify offers better compliance with spend policies a huge challenge for most companies of any scale. Similarly Salesforce offered easier to use CRM to salespeople and better metrics for the sales manager. Yammer offers employees a better communication mechanism and their IT department compliance controls. The end user value proposition drives press and word of mouth sharing. It’s the best angle to benefit from consumer app distribution channels. But the manager value proposition drives conversion to paid accounts. So if you’re serving this market remember the one-two punch. Published 2012-04-26,Published 2012-04-26
http://tomtunguz.com/changes-in-the-rules-of-the-game/,Changes in the rules of the [startup] game,Changes in the rules of the [startup] game The famous global macro hedge fund manager George Soros once said “I don’t play the game by a particular set of rules; I look for changes in the rules of the game.” Inside the House of Money Soros' insight is equally well applied to startups. Successful startups discover and leverage changes in the rules of the game. Discovering the changes in the rules of the game is one of the hardest things about starting a company but understanding precisely the change and developing a hypothesis for exploiting the change is essential. Typically there are three types of changes in the rules of the game that startups pursue: technology discontinuities ecosystem discontinuities and behavioral discontinuities. Technology discontinuities those changes in the rules that occur as a result of new technology are often the most apparent. Clay Christensen’s smaller hard drives is the classic example. More recently big data technologies like MapReduce OpenFlow Networking enterprise grade flash storage and NoSQL databases represent fundamental advances in technology. Technology discontinuities afford opportunities first in commercializing new technologies (MapR Pure Storage BigSwitch) and second capitalizing upon them as advantages in other pre-existing markets (risk modeling in financial services and real time bidding ad tech for example). Ecosystem discontinuities arise when the costs to serve customers in a sector suddenly change dramatically. In the last five years social media and mobile app distribution have built platforms offering unparalleled access to billions of customers at a fraction of the cost of highly efficient search advertising. This fundamental change in the rules has spawned tens if not hundreds of fast growing social and mobile companies like Pinterest Kabam PocketGems and others. Ecosystem discontinuities typically offer short term customer acquisition advantages for first-movers and fast learners. Whoever can learn the new rules of the game the quickest will win. Behavioral discontinuities are the most nuanced and subtle changes in the rules of the game. They require entrepreneurs to examine and extrapolate small changes in user behavior into new opportunities and build precisely the product that enables users to say “Yes that’s exactly what I needed.” Behavior changes typically start very small and then grow quite quickly. Social networking represents a fundamental shift in communication patterns that started by satisfying two human desire curiosity and vanity and provided the substrate for a massive behavioral change. Behavioral discontinuities require a deep understanding of changing user wants and needs. These are often discovered through self-observation introspection or field research. Other discontinuities: Of course there are many other types of discontinuities. Swings in the financial markets both public and private government regulation and antitrust rulings industry consolidation and so on. And there are myriad ways uncovering these discontinuities. But common to most startups is the successful identification of a discontinuity and hypothesis for how to exploit it. Discovering the changes in the rules of the game may take years of observation or it can happen in a flash. It can happen in any number of ways. But ultimately it’s what we’re all chasing.

http://tomtunguz.com/salesforce-s-1/,Benchmarking Salesforce's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking Salesforce's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Salesforce went public more than 10 years ago. This harbinger of subscription internet delivered software created one of the most exciting waves in software and the single most valuable SaaS company today worth $37B as of this writing. If I had to choose one chart to describe Salesforce it would be the one above. Salesforce remains the fastest growing SaaS company on record. More impressively than the growth rates are the scale of the numbers. Seven years after founding the company generated $500M in revenue. No other SaaS company has come close to the same scale of achievement. Salesforce’s S-1 contains the company’s data all the way back to Salesforce’s second year since founding and we can see the revenue growth in the first few years was astounding. In terms of revenue growth rates Salesforce was maintained a greater than 100% compound annual growth rate until $51M in annual revenue. Salesforce’s averaged an $11k account at IPO across 8000 customers which is among the bottom third of SaaS companies. SMBs (less than 200 employees) contributed 40% of revenue mid-market customers (200-500 employees) contributed 30% and enterprise rounded out the last 30%. To grow this quickly Salesforce invested a significant amount in Sales & Marketing but not meaningfully more than the SaaS median. In the company’s earliest years Salesforce invested about 75-100% of revenues into sales and marketing a figure that tapers off to the 50%. Salesforce recorded impressive sales efficiency metrics of greater than 1 meaning one dollar of Sales and Marketing investment bought more than 1 dollar of revenue for years 3 through 7. This amazing sales efficiency fueled the company’s growth and minimized cash burn. And the company reached cash flow break even three years into sales having burned about $69M. Initially the company spent very little on engineering. In fact it was once among the lowest of any SaaS company. But now the company is on a steady path above the median as the company builds new products to cross sell its enormous customer base including help desk software business intelligence and marketing products. Salesforce is a unique business. Out of the gate the company grew grew grew and it’s never looked back. Compared to several newer SaaS companies Salesforce was remarkably capital efficient. The first pure play SaaS company Salesforce remains the city upon a hill. Published 2015-01-27,Published 2015-01-27
http://tomtunguz.com/content-marketing-engine/,How I Built a Performant and Measurable Content Marketing Engine,How I Built a Performant and Measurable Content Marketing Engine In almost every industry startups and venture capital included content marketing has become an essential tool for growth. Over the past four years I’ve developed infrastructure analyses and processes to help this blog grow from just a few visitors per month to nearly a hundred thousand today achieved a Twitter follower quarterly growth rate of 20% and built a mailing list of close to one thousand readers. In this post I’ve detailed are the strategies software and techniques I use. This is the architecture diagram for the blog. After developing this infrastructure the three most important conclusions I’ve reached about content marketing initiatives are: Content marketing must be tied to path-of-business systems and processes; Daily experimentation and measurement are the best ways to systematically improve performance; Content syndicated as part of the effort must be high quality genuine and relevant to the target audience. At the outset I measured the blog’s sucess with metrics like traffic growth and increased follower counts. But I’ve come to believe that to be successful content marketing must further a business goal like increasing marketing qualified leads brand building or recruiting. Therefore content marketing infrastructure can’t simply be a blogging platform and a Twitter client. The content marketing systems must tie into customer relationship systems (Salesforce) applicant tracking systems (Jobvite) customer support systems (Zendesk) or the like. My goal for the blog is to first contribute to the startup community with content then reach all the relevant entrepreneurs I can and ultimately build lasting relationships with entrepreneurs. I believe that great entrepreneurs can come from anywhere. This blog helps me find them. This is my process: Every working day I write a post. First I syndicate that post to the places entrepreneurs congregate online. Today those places are HackerNews Quibb LinkedIn and Twitter. These social channels and dark social visits generate more than 50% of the traffic to the blog. Direct navigation contributes 30% and email plus RSS account for the remainder. Second I try to respond to readers’ comments and suggestions. Inbound volumes vary by day sometimes it’s just a tweet or two. Other times I receive fifty tweets and emails. Many of these responses happen offline. The blog’s content breaks the ice during meetings and starts conversations at meetups and conferences. These interactions both digital and physical help me build audiences on Twitter LinkedIn and Quibb. But building an audience and increasing follower metrics aren’t the end goal. I want to find and meet entrepreneurs among those audiences and build relationships with them. To solve that problem I built a tool in Rails called Scour. Scour aggregates publicly available data applies some basic filters and scours each week’s new followers to surface entrepreneurs and other people in the startup ecosystem. Each week Scour combines those people into a business development list that I use to grow my network. I contact each person on the Scour list to chat or meet. After the meeting I add a few notes about each person into a CRM for people called Contactually. These details might include a funny story shared interests mutual friends and personal goals. If the person I’ve met is an entrepreneur I catalog the salient details of their business in Salesforce. Third I try to deepen and extend my relationship with people in my network and with readers by offering email subscription and RSS subscription on the blog by creating periodic follow ups in Salesforce and Contactually to schedule meetings and by nurturing those relationships as best I can. Last I analyze each step of the process to determine how well the four initiatives are performing. Each day I consult my SumAll dashboard for site traffic email deliverablity email list growth Twitter follower growth and engagement rates. Each week I’ll review changes in Twitter audience using FollowerWonk and Wildfire’s Monitor tool to benchmark growth. In addition I’ve instrumented the blog with custom Google Analytics triggers to track social sharing subscribes and internal site navigation which are analyzed each week. That data informs changes to the layout and style of the blog. Each weekend I analyze one key component of the blog’s performance. Last week I researched the impact of headers and images on engagement and bounce rates. Other areas I explore include site performance SEO content keyword analysis twitter recirculation analysis social sharing time of day analysis twitter ads analysis and many others. I code each of these projects in Ruby and R and then add them to a periodic analysis to ensure none of the conclusions change with time. Ultimately content marketing like performance marketing and brand building have to contribute to the business in a quantifiable way. By coupling content marketing to a path-of-business system and instrumenting every step of the way it’s possible to create a performant engine for growth. Published 2013-11-08,Published 2013-11-08
http://tomtunguz.com/best-metric/,The One Best Metric for Your Startup to Maximize,The One Best Metric for Your Startup to Maximize It’s not engagement. Engagement (time-on-site page views number of sessions per day) is the wrong concept because it doesn’t apply to most products. The best metric is share of habit. Engagement fails the majority of products as the best metric to optimize because maximizing engagement/time-on-site contradicts the product’s purpose. Google relentlessly whittles down the time it takes for users to complete a search. Sparrow reduces email client use. Online travel agents and e-commerce companies minimize conversion funnel duration. Expensify slashes time spent filing expenses. For other products engagement is a good metric. Facebook and Instagram and the New York Times and YouTube and other media sites do maximize time on site. The more time on site a user spends the greater the number of ad impressions and hence revenue. But all these products seek to maximize share of habit. Google Expedia Sparrow YouTube Expensify Facebook and Instagram share a goal to win 100% share of the instances their users search book travel email watch videos file expenses share with friends and take beautiful photographs. They all aim to maximize share of habit. Focusing on share of habit puts the user first. It aligns long term incentives between the product and the user because the right feature set will bring users back time and again to the product. Also winning share of habit means understanding the environment of the user - what competition for time and attention does my user face - and creating a superior experience. As a product manager for a new product or a founder of a new startup I would set my sights on winning share of habit.

http://tomtunguz.com/death-by-a-thousand-small-features/,Death by a thousand small features,Death by a thousand small features In 2010 Gaia Online started a user acquisition campaign to grow their user base. To simplify the on boarding process they launched the Big Red Button home page below. It worked. Conversion rates from the home page spiked. Simple user experiences like this big red button are effective because users understand what is expected of them. There is just one flow. But small features imperceptible innocuous features can unexpectedly alter user behavior by adding new flows. The coupon code is a great example of this: The coupon code is a universal UI element in most check out processes. It seems like a great feature. But as an ecommerce expert pointed out to me yesterday it’s a huge problem. It is a call-to-action to abandon the current cart - a worst case scenario. If a customer has a coupon code the feature works as expected and the customer enters the code and pays for their basket. But should a full-price paying consumer stumble across the coupon code the customer will say to themselves “Oh maybe I should find a coupon to get a better deal” bouncing from the site. Conversion rates plummet. The coupon code introduces a harmful user flow. And the worst part is the product prods the user to pursue this path. Every few months it’s worth evaluating user flows. Even throwaway features like coupon codes can have significant impact on user conversion rates distracting users from the ultimate goal - using your product.

http://tomtunguz.com/data-science-in-freemium-businesses/,Data science in freemium businesses,Data science in freemium businesses Freemium businesses' marketing techniques are immensely powerful. They drive large amounts of users to try a product and convert some small fraction of those to paid upending the enterprise sales model. In some sense freemium businesses are real world Monte Carlo simulations. Because of the large volume of users using the product freemium businesses can generates gigabytes of interaction data and conversion-to-paid data which makes these kinds of startups particularly well suited to data science A/B testing and regression analysis. Over the past week I’ve been trying this first hand. I’m building a Bayesian model in to predict whether an account will convert to paid for one of the companies I work with. I hope that ultimately this model will prioritize leads for an inside sales team. The process of building this model has forced me to refine my thinking about the metrics we gather the conversion to paid upgrade process and customer segments. I’m still working on this model but some of the questions I found myself asking: Are we collecting the right data to build a model? How can we supplement data about our users to give them more context for analysis? What kinds of characteristics should indicate a customer will likely upgrade? Can I validate those assumptions in the data? Do we have a good enough trigger to convert to paid system? Do our pricing plans make sense for our user base? Instead of pursuing a product centric analysis of our conversion funnel in which customer feedback and design judgement is considered this process has forced me to perform a customer centric analysis of the conversion funnel. At the very least I’ve come away with a better understanding of our customers. But I’m hopeful that this conversion to paid regression will be successful that revenues grow faster as a result and I can adopt the technique with more startups.

http://tomtunguz.com/bitcoin-investment-trends/,What's Really Happening in the World of Bitcoin Investment,What's Really Happening in the World of Bitcoin Investment In response last week’s post on The Fastest Growing Areas of Startup Investment in 2015 in which Bitcoin topped the list I received many questions about the underlying dynamics of this startup segment. Which regions? Which stages? How much is going into Bitcoin companies. Using Crunchbase data I analyzed BTC investment patterns over the past 4 years. The chart above shows that Bitcoin investment started in earnest in 2013. In 2014 total investment spiked to more than $3.5B and through June 2015 Bitcoin startup have raised more than $4B. This data implies 2015 should be the best year ever for Bitcoin investment. As for stage of investment I’ve decided that Series A and B are too vague to be meaningful to describe the stages of companies when they raise capital. Instead I created segments of investment based on round size: < $5M < $30M and so on. Early stage Bitcoin investment will likely have peaked in 2014 which saw more than 200 sub-$5M investment rounds and about 200 sub-$30M investment rounds. While sub-$5M investment rounds have fallen by 55% sub-$30M rounds have fallen by 87%. Megarounds have taken their place. Larger than $30M rounds now account for 73% of dollars invested in BTC companies. As the early wave of Bitcoin companies have matured the early winners are benefitting from a vibrant late stage investment market. In the meantime it seems early stage investors are waiting to see how those companies fare. There are many different points of view on the future of Bitcoin. In countries like Argentina Bitcoin has become a vital part of the daily economy. In the US BTC has relatively small adoption. Some point to the innovation of the blockchain and the impact this distributed secure transactional technology will bring to contracts. But it’s still early. I believe that Bitcoin will be a transformational technology. But it will take some time for the innovation to be brought to market in a way that people understand and value. At least for now though the early winners of the Bitcoin startup sector are finding later stage capital in droves while the early stage companies face a leaner environment than 2014.

http://tomtunguz.com/open-source-exits-by-license/,Which Open Source License Should Your Project Use if You Want to Raise Venture Capital?,Which Open Source License Should Your Project Use if You Want to Raise Venture Capital? When deciding to open source software one of the key questions teams must answer is the license under which they will distribute their software. There are a wide variety of different alternatives. But the three most common are GPL Apache and MIT. I was curious if there was any relationship between type of license used by startup commercializing open source software and their ability to raise capital and exit. Black Duck Software a company which scans code bases to find open source software to make sure they are properly licensed releases a survey each year of the top 20 licenses used in open source projects. License Share GPL Family 42% MIT 20% Apache 16% Developers chose the GPL family of licenses in 42% of projects compared to 20% for the MIT license and 16% for Apache. However looking at the chart above we can see that Apache projects raise a disproportionate amount of capital compared to their share of open-source projects. Apache licensed projects represent only 16% of the number of projects but they account for more than 50% of venture dollars raised to commercialize those projects. In large part this figure is driven by companies commercializing Hadoop namely Cloudera Hortonworks and MapR. The MIT license punches below its weight. Developers chose the MIT license for 20% of code repositories but commercial entities of MIT projects raised less than 1% of venture dollars. GPL licenses projects represent 42% of projects and 37% of dollars. In terms of exits including both acquisition and IPO GPL licensed projects dominate having generated more than $6 billion in liquidity compared to $2B for Apache projects. In part this could be due to the fact that the GPL license predates the Apache license by 10 years (1989 vs 2000). In fact the three largest open source acquisitions Sourcefire ($2.4B) Novell ($2.1B) MySQL ($1.0B) were all GPL licensed projects. MySQL and Novell were founded before the Apache license was written (1979 and 1995). Given the revenues being generated by the Hadoop vendors and other commercialization startups of Apache projects like Cassandra it’s very likely the next five years we will see Apache licenses is catching up to GPL licenses in exit value. While there are some substantive differences between the licenses in terms of IP rights which I won’t dive into in this post it seems that there isn’t a very strong correlation between a startup’s open source license and its ultimate success. Apache projects which on the whole are newer have raise more capital but because they are newer haven’t yet contributed substantially to returns. Ultimately the key drivers of success for startups commercializing open source projects will likely live in their ability to create defensible and sustainable business models in some fashion on free software.

http://tomtunguz.com/sales-productivity-evaluation/,A Single Report to Measure the Health of Your Startup's Sales Team,A Single Report to Measure the Health of Your Startup's Sales Team After a SaaS startup has achieved some degree of product market fit the business will likely ramp the go-to-market teams and in particular the sales team. Measuring and tracking the performance of a growing sales team is critical to the growth and financial health of a business. The report above is the most effective view of the performance of a sales team I’ve found for SaaS startups. A VP of Sales at a Redpoint portfolio company introduced this report to me and now I can’t live without it. Let me quickly describe the report. On the left the names of all the sales are listed in order of tenure. The letter after their name indicates inside sales (I) or outside sales (O) rep. The fiscal year quarter is listed across the top. The percentage within each cell conveys the fraction of quota achieved in that period. The last column contains the pipeline to quota ratio - the total qualified pipeline of the salesperson for the quarter divided by their quarterly quota. Edward Tufte master of information design would be proud of this report because it conveys at least four different things about the health of a sales team succinctly. Team Composition First the report indicates the number of the inside and outside sales reps. In this chart the letter following the names of these hypothetical sales reps indicates 4 inside sales reps and 3 outside sales reps. Team Tenure Second the report conveys the state of the sales team. The startup has five ramped sales people and two new sales people one quarter into their two quarter ramp. Past Team Performance Third the report displays the current and historical performance of the sales team across many different dimensions. The sales team in a worrisome state. Let’s walk through some analysis of individual rep performance: Only two reps exceeded their quota during their two quarter ramp (Cailin and Roberta). Most of the others missed quota substantially which raises the question: is sales on-boarding and training effective? Only one rep Roberta consistently beats quota. Sarah looks like she might be a strong performer. The jury is still out on Holden and Laurence and Sarah. It’s not clear how deep the sales bench is and how much hiring/firing the company will need to do in the next six months. Q4 2014 was a good quarter for most ramped salespeople. Why? Did the company run a sales promotion? Or did a new feature launch? The outside teams seem to outperform the inside sales teams. This could be because the product is a better fit for larger customers; or it could be because the startup hasn’t found the right profile for hiring inside sales people; or the inside sales leads aren’t good quality; or many other reasons. Nevertheless it’s worth further investigation. Finally three of five reps exceeded quota last quarter which is average. Most sales teams see about 60% of their reps achieving or exceeding quota. Next Quarter’s Numbers Fourth the Pipeline/Quota ratio provides some insight into whether the company will achieve its plan next quarter. Ideally we would see greater than 3x coverage for all the teams. Cailin blew out Q4 but Q1 doesn’t look very promising for her because she closed all her good leads in Q4 and her pipeline is thin. Same for Roberta. Holden looks to book another good quarter. But on the whole the sales team pipelines aren’t as healthy as the company might hope which means Q1 2015 bookings will probably be lower than planned. This presentation of sales team performance is the most effective I’ve seen. In a single chart a management team and a board can perform first-pass evaluations of the sales hiring and on-boarding processes the depth of the sales team the consistency of performance and the probability of the company achieving its plan next quarter.

http://tomtunguz.com/rule-of-40/,The Data Behind the Rule of 40%,The Data Behind the Rule of 40% In “The Rule of 40% for a Healthy SaaS Company” Brad Feld shared a simple rule of thumb growth investors often apply to judge the attractiveness of a $50M business. “The 40% rule is that your growth rate + your profit should add up to 40%.” I was curious if this theory were broadly true applicable for growth stage companies Brad mentioned but also early stage companies. So I calculated this metric which I’ll call the GP metric in this post for all the publicly traded SaaS companies over their lifetimes. The chart above plots the median GP metric by years since founding. I’ve added a horizontal line at 40%. The GP metric trends from 100%+ to about 30% over about 15 years. As Brad wrote growth investors apply the 40% rule to companies with $50M+ in revenue which is right around year five or six of most of these businesses to quickly figure out if the high level financial profile might be a fit for them. And the median figures in years six and later seem to support the case that the rule of 40% might be a good filter for investors in later stage companies to identify outliers because the median decreases as these businesses mature and a 40% floor would surface more attractive companies. In the early days of a company’s life though the median GP metric is substantially greater often exceeding 100%. In fact it ought to be as high as possible. Larger values imply the business is growing quickly and/or generating lots of profit. For example Workday charted the biggest GP figure in this data set of 189% in 2010 when the business grew from revenue by 252% and recorded net income of -57%. As they age many public SaaS companies haven’t been able to sustain a 40% GP metric. This chart shows the median score for each company across the number of years which they have provided data to public market investors. All of these companies are worth several hundred million to many billions of dollars. As Brad pointed out the spirit of the Rule of 40% is a good one. The Rule establishes a relationship between the growth rate and burn rate of a business and defines a healthy operating zone for a growth stage business. Consequently the Rule of 40% metric may be a solid first pass filter for a growth equity investor to determine whether a business might be a good investment candidate. But for early stage companies whose GP metric may exceed 100% or more founders should focus more on the unit economics (average revenue per customer cost of customer acquisition churn rates contribution margin) which drive the business’s top line and bottom line. Everything else will take care of itself. Published 2015-02-11,Published 2015-02-11
http://tomtunguz.com/how-big-should-your-sales-pipeline-be/,The Essential Go To Market Math for Beating Your SaaS Startup's Growth Targets,The Essential Go To Market Math for Beating Your SaaS Startup's Growth Targets How big is your SaaS startup’s sales pipeline? How big does it need to be to achieve next month’s bookings target? What is the ratio of the sales pipeline to bookings? What should it be? When asked these questions during a fundraising pitch one CEO responded with the number of demos per account executive per day to attain next month’s bookings impressively conveying his command of his business. A startup’s leadership should know the number of customers sales and marketing qualified leads to meet or exceed plan at all times. If you haven’t performed this exercise this before use the interactive worksheet below. Change any of the text boxes and the figures will update. If you’re reading this post by email please click through. Some email clients don’t allow JavaScript for security. Let’s examine a hypothetical company with a bookings plan of $250k an Average Revenue per Customer of $20k. The typical account executive at this company owns a $500k ARR quota and on average achieves 75% of quota. 20% of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) convert to Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs). And 20% of SQLs convert to customers. Monthly Bookings Target $ ARPC $ AE Quota $ Annual Quota Attainment decimal Number of AEs Required 8 MQL to SQL SQL to Customer Conversion Rates decimal Leads and Customers Required to Attain Bookings Goal Leads and Customers Required to Attain Bookings Goal Leads and Customers Required to Attain Bookings Goal Leads and Customers Required to Attain Bookings Goal MQL SQL Customers Per Rep 79 8 2 Total 625 64 13 The worksheet tells us quite a bit about this company. To attain next month’s bookings number the business needs 8 fully ramped account executives. Each of these account executives must sell two contracts. To close these two customers the company must generate 8 sales qualified leads and 79 marketing qualified leads. In total the company must generate 625 MQLs and 64 SQLs. Note I’m rounding up in each of the calculations to be conservative which is why the numbers may not divide evenly as integers. These figures should inform sales and marketing hiring plans. The company requires a certain number of account executives to close customers and a certain number of marketers or sales development reps to generate leads. The data also provide a basic estimate of marketing costs. Multiplying the lead requirements by cost per lead provides a base level estimate for marketing spend in a given period. From which a business could compute cost of customer acquisition and many other figures. All of these elements to the plan whether account executives or leads have a latency. Account executives must be hired and they must be trained. This takes time perhaps 3-4 months for very efficient sales teams. Then they must be provided leads which require time some time to produce. And of course the sales cycle introduces latency to bookings. While this worksheet doesn’t include any of those important factors they must be considered. Returning to the first set of questions the ratio of the pipeline has to be 5x the bookings target or the inverse of the SQL-to-customer ratio which is 0.2 for our hypothetical company. This makes sense. Only one in five leads will convert to a paying customer. There are often questions around what is lead. As long as you’re measuring success rate from whatever point you call a lead a lead or an SQL an SQL then the definitions don’t matter for this analysis. Last this concept can also be applied at an individual level. Different account executives will have varying conversion rates. These vary as a function individual skill experience region geography industry and other factors. Therefore the required pipeline to enable each sales person to achieve their quota is again just the inverse of their lead to close rate. Understanding the go-to-market requirements of a business is an essential skill at every stage of a SaaS company and with just a few basic measurements founders and CEOs of SaaS companies can understand precisely what the company must achieve each month to exceed its goals.

http://tomtunguz.com/diagrams/,How to Analyze Your Startup Like A VC in 15 Minutes Or Less,How to Analyze Your Startup Like A VC in 15 Minutes Or Less When I first started in venture capital five years ago I wanted to create a programmatic way to analyze companies well. My goal was to be able to step into a meeting with an entrepreneur with some kind of form that I would fill out throughout the meeting so that by the end of the meeting I might have an understanding how the startup fits into its ecosystem. It took quite a while to devise this framework and to revise it until it became useful practical and insightful. I spoke with friends who were consultants and who analyze companies for a living. I read many books on the topics of competition and strategy. Last I spoke with other investors. But in the end I chose three simple frameworks that were already well-known and which fit together on two sheets of paper: The Business Model Canvas Porter’s Five Forces and Value Chain Analysis. Each of these frameworks evaluates a different aspect of the business. The Business Model Canvas explains concisely how a business operates. Value Chain Analysis describes where the startup fits within an ecosystem and Porter’s Five Forces exposes the level of competition the startup will face. I’m sharing these in the hopes that these frameworks might benefit entrepreneurs when selecting ideas to pursue refining go-to-market strategy and pitching their businesses to investors. The Business Model Canvas The first sheet of paper is the Business Model Canvas which is a framework invented by Alexander Osterwalder in a great book called Business Model Generation. The BMC describes the key operations of a business: the Value Proposition the Key (Operating) Activities Partners Assets/Resources Customer Relationships Go-To-Market Channels Customer Segments Cost Structure and Revenue Streams. Filling out this form creates a document that captures what a business offers how it reaches which customers and how profitable it could be. The Grand Unifying Framework - Matrixing Value Chains and P5F To set the business in proper context is to understand the business environment around it. To do this I’ve matrixed the Porter’s 5 Forces Analysis and Value Chain Analysis. Combining the two yields a chart like the one below which I’ve filled out for a company I work with called Electric Imp. Electric Imp provides the infrastructure to connect all kinds of devices to the web. We sell this technology to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). I call this chart the GUF (Grand Unifying Framework). The horizontal categories denominate the value chain and the vertical categories are Porter’s Five Forces Filling out this chart accomplishes three things. First it enumerates the value chain. Second it offers a lens into the motivations of each player within the ecosystem. Third it provides visibility into which players in the ecosystem have the most power and control the dollars. Each of these three concepts is essential to understand when entering a market. What To Look For In These Analyses The GUF shows the player/column the ecosystem has the most power. The column that has lowest supplier power lowest customer power no substitutes and highest barrier to entry is the most powerful player in the ecosystem and the one that will dictate the way most other players do business. Secondly the GUF indicates how much competition exists within one part of the value chain in the competition row. Ideally there isn’t much competition and the barriers to entry are high which will mean a higher margin business. Intense competition means an efficient market and low margins. The BMC is a description of how a company goes to market. A well defined value proposition is the most critical thing. Next understanding the customers and customer segments is also quite important. Last the cost structure of the business is critical. This determines burn rate and capital requirements. For an early stage company most of the other categories including revenue model can be fuzzy. But the more detailed and fleshed out the BMC the better. Frameworks FTW Frameworks provide a structured way of thinking about things and these three help me understand startups at a deeper level. I hope these frameworks help you choose the best idea to pursue find the most effective path to market and help you to pitch your startup idea most effectively.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-capital-raises-and-ipo/,The Fundraising Patterns of Unicorn SaaS Companies,The Fundraising Patterns of Unicorn SaaS Companies Figuring out how much capital your startup may need to raise will inform lots of different strategic decisions. A startup’s growth rate is often highly correlated with the amount of capital it can invest in sales and marketing. More customers means more bookings which means more capital and so on. The chart above shows the cumulative dollars raised across a basket of more than 50 enterprise software companies. The median company raises $88M before IPO in year six. These companies typically raised $4-6M in their first and second year of existence. Then raised a Series B of about $15-20M then a Series C of about $20M and finally a growth round of about $40M. Of course the medians hide the outliers. Some companies like Veeva raised only $4.5M before IPO and others like Box have raised $571M+ so the distribution has some outliers. As the chart above shows two companies raised only one venture round before IPO and three companies have raised 8. The median company raises 4. Despite the fact that SaaS companies are building some of the most efficient business models ever newer software companies are raising more capital. Software companies founded in 1998-2001 raised $50M before IPO. On the other hand companies founded between 2010-2013 have raised three times that amount at more than $150M. This increase in venture dollars is enabling companies to sustain larger market caps at IPO. Software companies are growing at faster rates than they have in the past on average needing half the amount of time to reach $50M in revenue because of the availability of large amounts of capital. The capital invested in enterprise startups in megarounds rounds of greater than $50M has exploded in the last 5 years from under $250M to greater than $4B in 2014. In 2009 there were 4 megarounds. In 2014 there were 38. Meanwhile the average size of a megaround has increased from $71M to 113M over the same time period. Megaround frequency and size have both grown substantially over the past five years. It’s precisely this capital that is inflating the total dollars raised figures of newer companies and fueling them to grow faster. Software companies’ fundraising patterns have changed dramatically over the last sixteen years. Though the number of rounds before IPO hasn’t changed materially round sizes and total dollars invested have ballooned. This cash enables startups to grow faster in the same period of time as their predecessors and increasing their market caps at IPO. Published 2015-01-22,Published 2015-01-22
http://tomtunguz.com/signaling-risk-data/,The Optimal Seed Round Construction to Maximize Series A Success,The Optimal Seed Round Construction to Maximize Series A Success image credit: Svjetlana Tepavcevic Is it better to raise your startup’s seed round from only angel investors or is it better to include a VC or two? Several founders on the precipice of launching their seed fundraising processes have asked me this question. It’s a very difficult one to answer hypothetically because there are many different variables to balance. For example VCs may invest larger sums than angel investors. The imprimatur of a VC’s investment in a company might help convince potential customers and recruits. But some might argue their money brings potential signaling risk. So I’ve tried to answer the complex question using Crunchbase data from 2009 to today. Below I compare and contrast the fundraising histories of about 3700 startups that have raised seeds. About 1 ⁄3 of these startups raised exclusively from “angels.” I’m using the word angels broadly; it includes individual investors incubators and accelerators. The other 2/3s raised from a combination of sources but include at least one VC. The typical seed round with VCs has 1.6 VCs involved. I’ve filtered the data to look only at VCs who have invested in at least 50 companies during the past 5 years to ensure we’re only looking at truly active market participants. Metric Angel Seeds VC Seeds Series A Success Rate 33% 54% Mean Seed Raised $M 1.3 1.6 Median Seed Raised $M 1.2 1.5 Mean Series A Raised $M 7.3 7.4 Median Series A Raised $M 5.3 6.0 This data surfaces three observations: Startups with at least one VC in their seed round raise Series As 64% more often than do angel-backed startups. I can’t prove causation i.e. that having a VC involved is the cause of this increase because of the limitations of the data. But I believe the next observation sheds some light onto this trend. VC-backed seed rounds are 23% larger on average which is statistically significant to greater than 99% confidence. This makes sense. VCs typically invest from larger funds and are more willing to invest more dollars in seed rounds. And we’ve previously shown that larger seed rounds correlate to higehr follow on rates for Series As. A longer runway enables startups to experiment more and ideally become larger more attractive investments for Series A investors. Curiously there is no statistically significant difference in the size of Series A rounds between the two categories of startups. Successful angel-seeded companies raise just as much money as VC-seeded companies. In other words a great entrepreneur can come from anywhere. To further prove the point I’ve charted the distributions of Series As below. Angel seeds are in blue and VC seeds are in red. They are in fact identical. Now to dig into the signaling risk question. The table below contrasts the financing histories of VC-backed seeds as a whole with the 351 companies in the data set who raised their Series A from a VC participating in their seed. Metric Insider VC Leads A All VC Seeds Mean Seed Raised $M 1.6 1.6 Median Seed Raised $M 1.5 1.5 Mean Series A Raised $M 7.2 7.4 Median Series A Raised $M 5.8 6.0 This time there are two important conclusions: Insider VCs lead Series As in about 26% of their seeds. The remaining 28% of seed-financed startups who raised As accepted terms from new investors. In other words an equal amount of startups raise Series As from VC insiders as outsiders. Startups who raise Series As from outsider VCs fare just as well as those who raise from an insider VC. Round sizes are nearly identical both in the seed and A mean and median. Furthere there’s no statistically signficant difference across any of the metrics. In other words the presence of a VC investor in the seed round doesn’t seem to impact a startup’s ability to raise a Series A at market terms. Raising larger seed rounds improve the odds that a startup will be able to raise a series A. It’s easier to raise larger rounds from VCs than angels simply because of fund size differences but the source of the capital whether angel incubator or early stage VC doesn’t meaningfully impact a startup’s ability to raise a Series A at a market price. Nor does raising a Series A from a VC insider. Published 2014-06-12,Published 2014-06-12
http://tomtunguz.com/a-letter-to-the-editor/,A Letter to the Editor,A Letter to the Editor Writing on the web is undergoing a renaissance. What started in the late 90s as mass-market adoption of blogging has given way to high production quality curated magazines. Despite all the innovation in blogging there’s one part of the magazine that hasn’t been reinvented: the Letter to the Editor. If you’ve ever read the Economist you might have breezed past this section. Two pages long and full of small quips and challenges the Letter to the Editor section has its own culture. Each letter starts with “SIR –” a relic of the magazine’s roots that I adore. Every major publication has such a section. But the blogging magazines like Svbtle Medium LinkedIn and the Magazine lack it. Over the past few weeks I’ve been asking successful bloggers like Chris Dixon and Andy Chen about the keys to their growth. Among other responses both highlighted community. But not just any community - one that engages in thoughtful discourse. Just look to one of Dixon’s most successful posts one on ecommerce in which many of the top ecommerce startup CEOs responded with their thoughts. The democratized blog platforms of the 90s solved the problem of communication between author and reader with comments. Today commenting is out of vogue because it leads to two problems: spam and vitriolic anger. You might argue no one reads these comments and they have no impact but a study published in Science proves the opinions carried in the comments meaningfully impact readers' perception of what they read. Kicking discussions to forums like HackerNews or Twitter is an interim hack but it decreases the value of the magazine’s platform by sapping readership. Whether on-site or off-site comments aren’t the right communication vector. Instead a redesigned curated section for Letters to the Editor or one step further Letters to the Author might cultivate a reading community much more effectively than the commenting platforms in use today. It would be a place for discussions like the one between Dixon and Jason Goldberg to occur all of the time. As the writing renaissance blossoms the key to its long term success is fostering the exchange between readers and authors. We don’t yet have the proper tools engender thoughtful productive argument and exploration. But I’m hopeful that as part of the blog’s reinvention the re-imagining of the letter to the editor will draw an audience’s deeper engagement with these new magazines.

http://tomtunguz.com/advice-frameworks/,The Best Advice I've Ever Received,The Best Advice I've Ever Received “Advice is one person’s experience generalized” an entrepreneur told me once. “It’s a single point of view with all kinds of survivorship and attribution bias. Advice can be a terribly dangerous thing because it can be used as a shortcut for thinking.” When I asked how he responded to requests for advice because as a successful entrepreneur he was often solicited for it he replied that he first shared the structure and the framework he used to look at the problem. Only after discussing that did he reveal the details about he and his team had arrived at a decision. Each time someone asks for advice I remember that conversation and the wisdom that entrepreneur shared with me. And I wonder whether what I’m about to say is as helpful as the little piece of paper tucked into a fortune cookie an out-of-context recommendation that can be easily misinterpreted. When I reflect on the best advice I’ve received in my life it has never been the counsel that provided an immediate point-of-view on an answer. Rather it was the guidance that started as a single probing question that I couldn’t answer immediately a question that invited me to look upon the puzzle with a new perspective and demanded deeper thought. A little Buddhist Koan. I suppose that’s why I gravitate to frameworks and data when I write.

http://tomtunguz.com/service-now-churn/,How an $11B SaaS Company Measures Churn,How an $11B SaaS Company Measures Churn As I prepared the S-1 analysis for ServiceNow the third largest public SaaS company in the world I came across a section in their latest annual report called Key Factors Affecting Our Performance in which the company describes the two ways they evaluate churn. One is common but another is unusual. Below I’ve quoted their definitions. Upsell rate. To grow our business it is important for us to generate additional sales from existing customers which we refer to as our upsell rate. We calculate our upsell rate as the annualized contract value or ACV of upsells net of losses during the period divided by our total ACV signed during the period. The upsell rate was 36% 31% and 30% for the years ended December 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively. Our upsells are primarily derived by an increase in the number of seat licenses purchased by our customers and are also derived from the addition of other subscription services. Renewal rate. We calculate our renewal rate by subtracting our attrition rate from 100%. Our attrition rate for a period is equal to the ACV from lost customers divided by the total ACV from all customers that renewed during the period and from all lost customers… Our renewal rate was 97% 96% and 97% for the years ended December 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively. The Upsell rate is the calculation of the dollar retention or negative net churn figure and is commonly used by SaaS startups. While it’s a great metric using upsell rate alone to judge the health of the business can lead to false conclusions. For example if one massive customer buys more seats the upsell rate will look great at better than 100%. But if the company is losing 10% of the rest of its customer base each month the startup is in trouble. So in addition to dollar retention startups will often calculate unit retention as a way of seeing past the effects of large customers on dollar retention. But the unit figure has some problems particularly if a startup has a very diverse customer base with lots of smaller customers who will churn at very high rates and depress the unit retention. ServiceNow’s renewal rate is a great replacement for unit renewal. It’s a metric of revenue retention that doesn’t allow large customer upsells to mask customer churn and it conveys the health of the broad base of the business. As described above to calculate renewal rate use this formula: Renewal_Rate = 100% - Lost_ACV/(Lost_ACV + Total_Renewed_ACV) where ACV is annual contract value. Consider adding renewal rate to your SaaS startup’s key metrics. It’s another terrific diagnostic tool to understand the health of your customer base. Published 2015-06-10,Published 2015-06-10
http://tomtunguz.com/data-science-demystified/,Using Data to Demystify Data Science,Using Data to Demystify Data Science While the phrase data scientist may be growing exponentially in its usage and the number of data scientists job requisitions following a similar trend the definition of the term is hard to pin down precisely. I wasn’t sure I could define it well until I watched a talk by Hilary Mason former chief scientist at Bitly called Dirty Secrets of Data Science at a NYC meetup. During the presentation she highlighted a chart created by the Data Community DC team that demystifies term data scientist. Using a survey the DCDC team recorded the major activities of 250 people calling themselves data scientists. Once collected the team bucketed the activities (business learning & big data math programming and stats) and named four different behavioral segments of data scientist: data businessperson data creative data engineer and data researcher. Each of these roles emphasizes different skills. The data businessperson focuses on answering business questions such as forecasting the revenue for the business overt next year. Data creatives create data exploration experiences like ones Amanda Cox and her team built at the NYTimes. The data engineer erects the infrastructure to answer questions for the business e.g. Hadoop. Data researchers model data and develop algorithms to predict important things including which movie a consumer will want to see next what ad should be displayed to a particular user at a particular time and how much discount a user should be given to maximize loyalty. The diversity of these examples makes clear the day-to-day work of people calling themselves data scientists varies widely across five disciplines. Unfortunately the word data scientist conflates all five types of work. For startups this ambiguity makes hiring the right kind of data scientist a challenge. Most founders would likely point to the data businessperson. But the next question is what data infrastructure will that person need to perform their analyses? And so is a data engineer required to build that infrastructure? Or will an existing engineer support them? Computer science has formalized refined roles for Ops Back End Engineers Front End Engineers UX Designers UI Designers and Product Managers. It seems to me the same process will happen with data scientists as we discover and uncover the different key roles and functions they serve in startups. DCDC’s analysis is a great first step at defining those roles and creating a lexicon for distinguishing among them. Published 2014-01-22,Published 2014-01-22
http://tomtunguz.com/the-irl-era/,Design’s New Frontier: The IRL Era,Design’s New Frontier: The IRL Era When the neologism was popularized in 2004 by Tim O'Reilly the words Web 2.0 captured a desire for the web to become interactive. It was a description of a movement towards social media and engaging users on the web. But more than an idea it carried a design aesthetic which focused on the user user experience and engagement. After all users wouldn’t participate on a hostile site. We’re no longer in the Web 2.0 age - look no further than the Google Trends data to prove the point - but the relentless pursuit of the best user experience lives on in a new era the IRL (in real life) era. The IRL era is all about mating technology and the real world. IRL means paying for a coffee with a mobile phone that never leaves your pocket (Square) or pressing a button on an app to order a taxi pickup (Uber) or checking into a flight using a mobile barcode (Passbook) or unlocking your home’s front door with a button (Lockitron) or scanning an in-store barcode to find an item cheaper on the web and buying it with 1-click (Amazon) or changing your commute route because of a bad accident (Google Now). When backend software meets the real world through a mobile phone that’s an IRL experience. The payments systems are in place the integrations with airlines and taxis and inventory systems and physical things like locks exist. IRL apps require radical simplicity in their design. Otherwise they simply won’t be used. As a result these apps are single purpose and do just one thing well. Because they are the bridge between a physical and a digital world IRL apps also require a mastery of many different skills: radically simple mobile design backend and API integrations mobile application development ability business development for key partnerships and mobile app distribution to reach users. In Web 2.0 web pages and social interactions on the internet became accessible - and that was a pretty big wave. But the possibilities for engaging users IRL where they spend the majority of their time are so much larger. Published 2013-04-26,Published 2013-04-26
http://tomtunguz.com/branding/,Why Branding Is the Next Essential Startup Competency,Why Branding Is the Next Essential Startup Competency How much is the most valuable brand in the world Coca-Cola worth? $77.8B. That’s 45% of the company’s market cap. Often times winners create advantages in a market through brands. These brands evoke emotions within consumers: feelings of trust (Visa) of aspiration (Nike) of adventure (RedBull). And if the brand is strong enough it replaces the generic term: tissues/Kleenex internet search/Google glass cleaner/Windex. In Silicon Valley we tend to believe that better products win markets. It’s atypical to overhear a conversation at Blue Bottle Coffee or at YCombinator about brand building - brand attributes values positioning. Instead our exchanges focus more on technology and more recently design. But over the next several years marketing branding and positioning all under-appreciated disciplines in the valley will become markedly more important. As barriers to entry continue to fall driven by cloud technologies competition among startups will increase and the startups that reach their target customer bases with the best messaging building the most effective brands will win. We know storytelling will be the differentiator. Look at every commodity industry to see the value of branding. Nike makes running shoes. Kleenex manufactures tissues. But they each sell something else - they sell an idea. Nike sells excellence: “Just Do it.” Kleenex sells “taking care of family.” It’s logical that cash conscious startups should limit their investment to measurable marketing tactics. But as startups scale and as technologies commodify faster and faster branding building investments should become a key part of the marketing efforts of the business. Ultimately the brand may become half the value of the company and the true differentiator in the market place. That’s nothing to sneeze at. Published 2013-03-13,Published 2013-03-13
http://tomtunguz.com/the-venture-fund-of-the-future/,The VC Firm of the Future,The VC Firm of the Future The venture capital fund of the future will perform the same tasks as the venture funds of today: help portfolio companies evaluate new investment opportunities and build networks of other investors potential hires and founders. But to succeed over the next 25 years venture capital firms must increase the scale and sophistication of each of these duties by order of magnitude through technology. In the five years I’ve worked in the venture business I have witnessed tremendous change in the industry driven by intensifying competition for returns. The concentration of returns IPO and M&A markets fuels VC rivals to vie aggressively for the opportunity to invest in hyper-growth startups. One company’s initial public offering Facebook provided 77% of returns from venture backed IPOs in 2012. In the same year 10% of the acquisitions generated 50% of the proceeds in the M&A market. Despite a decrease in the total number of active funds competition has never been as fierce in the venture industry as today. To triumph in this market I believe venture capitalists must do three things. First they must create continuous information asymmetries. Second they must convince entrepreneurs they are the right partner. Third they must employ technologies to benefit their portfolio companies. In the same way hedge funds scour data sources for insight on investments in the public markets venture funds of the future will deploy technology to programmatically discover evaluate and prioritize up-and-coming startups for partners to pursue. There has never been more data collected on startups than today. Whether it’s iOS app store rankings web traffic growth LinkedIn profiles Twitter followers job listings Crunchbase financing history the list of data-rich sources stretches to the floor. Processing that data is the key to creating consistent information asymmetries. Having created that information asymmetry the VC of the future will be positioned to win the investment opportunity. The venture industry has transitioned from brand building through exclusivity to an era of marketing through accessibility. The venture fund of the future must contribute to the daily conversations of founders and entrepreneurs and foster the startup community. Those conversations occur on blogs Twitter LinkedIn HackerNews Quibb and a litany of other sites. By actively participating in the discussions venture capitalists build rapport and demonstrate expertise which are critical in an era of fierce competition. Once committed partners venture capital firms will use technology to further the success of their portfolio companies. This technology will take many forms including fostering internal communities providing competitive intelligence sharing recruiting tools and accessing preferred legal recruiting or marketing help. In short the emphasis in the words financial services will shift from financial raising and investing capital to service. The firms that embrace technology to find entrepreneurs at the right time engage them and assist them in achieving the success of their dreams will be the VC firms of the future.

http://tomtunguz.com/price-demand-curves-pmf/,Using Price & Demand Curves to Inform Startup Product Roadmaps,Using Price & Demand Curves to Inform Startup Product Roadmaps The traditional theoretical price demand curve is often drawn like this. The chart makes two points: there is some relationship between price and demand / revenue opportunity and customer segments underpin that relationship. Each segment demands different products to satisfy different needs and presents a different revenue/profit opportunity. Even if the details are very hazy price demand curves are useful tools to inform product strategy and prioritization. To make PD curves useful requires marketing research. It means identifying customer segments estimating the the demand of each segment quantifying the investment required to build the right product and uncovering the costs of acquiring and servicing customers within that segment. After all that there’s also a process of testing various price points to get a better sense of price elasticity. All of these are useful in the process of establishing product market fit. In most cases the demand curve is not a straight line. Sometimes the demand curve can be parabolic. Sometimes it has kinks. Sometimes the curve comprises ten segments and other times just three. Let’s look at a sketch of a freemium demand curve. Expensify initially offered a free product. Faced with skepticism from customers about the trustworthiness of entirely free product Expensify launched a $5 pricing plan and then the demand for the product grew substantially. By establishing even a very modest price Expensify engendered trust and credibility with its customers who became willing to submit credit card details shifting the demand curve and creating a revenue opportunity. Expensify’s example highlights another important point: demand curves aren’t static. They change with the introduction of new features sales efforts in educating the market and entry of competitors among other factors. Below is a hypothetical SaaS company’s price/demand curve evolving over time. The company begins with an SMB focused product which elicits no demand from Enterprise customers. After launching a management product with single-sign on features auditing and other features desired by the enterprise market the demand curve matures to the one on the right. Price/demand curves are very simple models of customer ecosystem but they are good frameworks for discussing a startup’s product evolution particularly in more established markets. With a little bit of work they can be used to compare the revenue opportunities afforded by different customer segments and answer the question of which product/feature does the company build next.

http://tomtunguz.com/private-public-market-disparity-ramifications/,The Gamble of the Private IPO,The Gamble of the Private IPO In a post earlier this week Josh Kopelman coined the term Private IPO to describe patterns in the runaway late stage financing market. In addition to the points Josh makes about the dangers of stale valuations there is another important and related implication for founders. When entrepreneurs pursue a Private IPO as the ultimate round before they go public they make an implicit bet about the growth rate of their businesses: company revenues will more than double before a public IPO. If the bet doesn’t pan out then the IPO is a down round - a fund raise at a lower share price than the last private round. This phenomenon isn’t uncommon. In fact 25% of 2014 IPOs were down rounds according to an analysis by Ben Narasin and Jeremy Abelson. Why is this the case? There is a substantial difference between the multiples investors pay in the private and the public markets. Internal Redpoint analysis concludes many private growth rounds occur at about twice the forward multiples of the public markets. Let’s make this more concrete. Suppose a company raises a Private IPO at 20x Enterprise Value / Forward Revenue multiple (close to the top of the private markets). When the company files for Public IPO it will more than likely trade at somewhere in the 10x EV/FR multiple range the industry average today for fast growth software companies. At half the forward multiple the company must double revenues to be worth the same. This multiple disparity is very much a new phenomenon in the last few years. Some historical context: in the past private markets paid smaller multiples than the public markets. After all investors bear substantially more risk investing in startups than established businesses. Today private market investors’ optimism has inverted the multiple curve and earlier investors are valuing businesses at substantially larger multiples. This inverted multiple curve has created an investor risk bubble. Alarmingly in the last year the difference between private and public multiples has widened. While private multiples have remained constant public software multiples halved. This multiple disparity creates a situation wherein entrepreneurs must make the implicit bet mentioned above. With each decrease in public market multiples the growth requirement becomes larger. These Private IPOs and substantial growth rounds are terrific financial products for entrepreneurs. They enable founders to grow their businesses to massive scale through a far less taxing fundraising process than Public IPOs. But it’s important to reconcile the differences between public and private market multiples when considering valuations and weigh the risks of the implicit bet a team makes on its growth rate when raising a Private IPO.

http://tomtunguz.com/1b_ma_events/,How Many Unicorns Sell Each Year?,How Many Unicorns Sell Each Year? How many companies sell each year for $1B or more? In the last ten years on average 2.5 US venture backed IT companies are acquired for $1B+. In the last ten years a total of 20 companies have sold themselves for greater than $1B. Over the past 20 years that trend has been relatively constant with the exception of the euphoria in 1999 and 2000. The typical unicorn acquisition generates $1.9B in proceeds. Though there is quite a bit of variance in the trend because the numbers of companies are relatively small we cannot say that the typical large acquisition is increasing in size. It seems relatively constant around $2B. Each year for the past decade about $6.4B of total proceeds are generated from the sales of these companies. A greater than $1B acquisition event is an enormous event for the acquiring company. Often times such an acquisition demands a significant amount of cash and stock as a fraction of total assets of the acquiring company. These are big bold bets. As the aperture of innovation widens - we’re seeing new financial services companies new logistics companies etc - the possibility of more $1B+ M&A increases because old world companies must evolve or become dinousaurs. So there is some reason to believe the M&A activity should increase. Additionally large tech companies have huge piles of cash on their balance sheets. How the richest segment M&A market will evolve is anyone’s guess. If the past is any indication we’ll see 2-3 $1B+ acquisitions each year yielding $10B in proceeds annually.

http://tomtunguz.com/urgent-vs-important/,Startup Best Practices 5 - Effectiveness not Productivity,Startup Best Practices 5 - Effectiveness not Productivity Like many others during my work day I fall into the firefighting trap a time mis-allocation problem that leaves me focusing on urgent but not necessarily important tasks. Firefighting is addictive because it’s fast-paced nonstop and fun. But firefighting is exhausting and leaves me feeling as if I haven’t made progress toward my goals. In addition firefighting inhibits effective time allocation. A week can pass and I find that the non-urgent but important projects like preparing for a board meeting and researching a new sector like Bitcoin have been starved for time. Or I look up and realize I’ve been spending most of my time on urgent but not-important things like returning huge volumes of email. Last week I came across an issue of Harvard Business Review called “Find Your Focus: Getting Things Done the Smart Way.” The issue is worth reading in its entirety because it reprints all the research of management effectiveness to grace an HBS page in the past ten years or so. Most of the content is available on the web for free. In the issue the authors focus exclusively on being effective not productive. It’s a semantic difference perhaps but an important one. One article in particular resonated with me. Called “Making the Most of Slow Time” the article highlights a framework Steven Covey created called the Prioritization Matrix which I’ve reprinted here. The idea underpinning the PM is to stop at each point when starting a task and asking is this urgent and is it important? If so then complete the task. If not then either delegate the task if it can be done by someone else dump the task because it’s neither important nor urgent or schedule a time to handle the non-urgent but important task. Asking this simple question helps prioritize the urgent and important tasks and ensures that the non-urgent but important tasks like board meeting preparation have time allocated to them. Since coming across the Bullet Journal six months ago I’ve become an adopter of the note-taking technique and it’s helped me keep organized. In 2014 I’m going to resolve to append Us and Is to each task in the bullet journal in the hopes I’ll be more effective. Published 2014-01-02,Published 2014-01-02
http://tomtunguz.com/growth-rates-of-public-saas-companies/,How Quickly Does a SaaS Startup Have to Grow to Go Public?,How Quickly Does a SaaS Startup Have to Grow to Go Public? At the time of the IPO the median Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company generates $100M in revenue creates $2.6M in profit and holds $85M in cash on the balance sheet. A company in this position typically raises $107M in its IPO and trades at 11x revenue for a $1.1B market cap. The path to getting there is revealing. Below is a chart showing the median revenue ramp of the 41 publicly traded SaaS companies by year since founding. In year 3 the median revenue is $11M. In year 4 the revenue figures more than double to $25M and then again to $55M. Note the $11M number in year 3 is somewhat skewed by extraordinarily fast-growing companies. I’ve used data from public filings in this analysis and of the 20 companies profiled with data available in this time frame only 5 of them (Veeva Marin LogMeIn SuccessFactors and DealerTrack) grew fast enough to IPO within a time period that would have forced them to disclose their year 3 revenues. By year four the sample size doubles to nine. To see the trend in greater detail click here. This chart shows the median growth rates of public SaaS companies by year since founding. 220% growth in year 3 and then about 110% growth for the next two years and then halving once more for the next four years. As for profitability the public SaaS companies in the data set spent 86% of revenue in Year 2 and 167% of revenue in year 3 before falling to the mid-fifties and reaching near-profitability in year 6. Of course there is a substantial variance hidden within these summary statistics. For example about 1 ⁄3 of the companies in the data set waited more than ten years to file their S-1s. Two waited 18 years. But the figures do provide a rough sense of the magnitude of revenue and the pace of growth needed to take a SaaS company public. Published 2014-03-13,Published 2014-03-13
http://tomtunguz.com/show-tell-customize/,Startup Best Practices 18 - Collaborating with Your Customer During Your Sales Process,Startup Best Practices 18 - Collaborating with Your Customer During Your Sales Process In sales processes showing a product is always better than talking about a product. Better still is co-customizing the product with the customer during the sales pitch. This customization could be as simple as integrations or changing colors. There’s no better way for customers to understand a product imagine how it would fit their needs and become committed to the purchase than customizing their instance during the sales process. I’ve watched this brilliant sales tactic fuel tremendous growth at Looker a fast growing analytics company. At Looker we call this technique co-development. Co-development has accelerated sales processes and maximized customer success. Here’s how it works. Each Looker instance must be configured to connect to a database be informed of the data schema and map the customer’s key metrics. As early as the first sales meeting with a prospective customer Looker schedules a 60 minute call with a data analyst. During those 60 minutes they co-develop these mappings and metrics. Within the first five or ten minutes the data analyst sees her data in Looker and quite tangibly understands the power of the product. As the meeting continues the data analyst will continue to learn and manipulate Looker so that by the end of the hour she will have the first version of a customized Looker for her business. There are three reasons co-customization accelerates sales cycles and mitigates churn risk. First co-customization provides instant gratification by minimizing the time to utility.. With co-development at Looker customers visualize their own metrics presented with all the nuances of the business known to the data analyst in the first hour of the sales pitch. The buyer’s expertise is incorporated into their version of the product immediately. Most SaaS sales processes have shifted from education to execution sales so buyers understand their needs before speaking to an account executive. Sales teams employing co-customization start the sales process with their product accelerating sales execution by showing rather than telling. Second co-customization best equips the internal champion to win internal approval for a purchase. The data analyst’s initial intent to purchase is quickly converted into a tangible shareable interactive product using real data. What could be more compelling as an internal sales tool? Just try it. Other internal customers of the product can tinker and test and the data analyst is empowered to assuage questions along the way. In addition the analysts initial effort induces a degree of commitment to the product - after all it’s the analysts code that is powering Looker already for the company. Third customers train themselves through the sales process. From the beginning to the end of the sales cycle data analysts become proficient in Looker relying on help during the sales process to ramp their understanding of the product. By the end of the sales process and implementation the customer’s data team has been using Looker long enough to support their internal stakeholders. This on-boarding minimizes churn. Whether you call it co-customization or co-development the idea of collaborating with a customer through a sales process to customize a SaaS product to a customer’s needs accelerates sales and maximizes customer success. Customers feel the responsiveness of the vendor understand how the product will fit into their organization and educate themselves through the process. Not every product is a good match for this type of sales tactic. But for the companies whose unit economics can justify the investment co-customization can be a powerful growth technique.

http://tomtunguz.com/public-correction-impact-saas/,The Impact of the Stock Market on SaaS Valuations in 2015,The Impact of the Stock Market on SaaS Valuations in 2015 The public markets are down more than 10% from their highs in the last few months. Public SaaS companies have been particularly hard hit. The chart above shows the enterprise value of publicly traded SaaS companies. Many of them are down substantially more than 10%. Let’s dig in a bit more. While there are five companies who currently sit at their all time highs as of August 21 more than 90% of the SaaS companies are below at a median decline of 40%. Apigee is down 80% and MobileIron has lost more than 60%. The impact to SaaS valuations in the public markets is broad and most of these names which have benefitted from better than average multiples are seeing the downside of those aggressive valuations in the form of larger than typical corrections. It’s not that the fundamentals of these businesses have changed broadly; rather public market investors view newly minted public software companies with more caution The chart above shows the Enterprise Value to Forward Revenue Multiple over the last two years. The dispersion in multiples in late 2013 when Xero topped 20x has become more concentrated recently. Nearly all companies now trade at less than 10x forward revenues and the median has dropped in August by 16%. Zooming into the median we see that August’s figure is 5.2 EV to Forward Revenue is tied for the third lowest in the last 24 months. One interpretation of forward multiple: investors are decreasingly confident in the ability of SaaS companies’ to achieve their projections. This is likely informed by the turmoil in China and the recently increasing volatility of the US stock market. Paraphrasing Burton Malkiel’s seminal book Wall Street prices are somewhat of a random walk - and so we shouldn’t extract extreme conclusions from the perturbations of the stock market. But there has been a material correction in the valuation of public SaaS/software companies in the past few months. It’s hard not to wonder when the realities of the public market will begin to influence the private markets. Published 2015-08-24,Published 2015-08-24
http://tomtunguz.com/record-fundraising-year/,The Coming Wave of Venture Capital and What It Means for Your Startup,The Coming Wave of Venture Capital and What It Means for Your Startup Through the first six months of 2014 VCs have raised about as much as all of 2013. If this pace of fund raising continues 2014 would mark the biggest year for VCs since 2001 when the industry raised about $38B. This new money hasn’t yet hit the startup fundraising market in earnest as the chart above shows. The second quarter of 2014 is the sixteenth largest by capital deployed sinced 1995 making it a top quartile quarter but to break into the top five that figure would need to triple. Nevertheless we will see a spike in the next six months as firms begin investing from new funds. Which startup sectors should expect to benefit from this surfeit of capital? Each quarter the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters gather data on the VC industry. I’ve used this data to draw the long term investment trends across the US venture capital industry. The chart above depicts the VC sector investment trends within this data and compares the share of VC dollars raised by entrepreneurs in particular sectors each quarter. Consumer startups have been raising between 15-20% of dollars for the past few years and that share seems to be on the rise. But make no mistake; software investments are the real story. VCs have doubled their allocations to software compared to five years ago. This shift to software has been at the expense of Infrastructure investments which saw their heyday in the 2000 era when the nervous system of the internet was built and scaled. Health startups have garnered a persistent share of about 20% of dollars. Meanwhile Energy investment has collapsed plagued by capital intensive projects with very long success horizons. Which rounds should become easier to raise? The NVCA’s data on share of investment dollars by stage is plotted above. Keep in mind the total number of investments has remained relatively constant at roughly 350 per quarter over the past few years. In that relatively calm environment there has been a marked shift to Early Stage/Series As investments on a dollars and number basis at the expense of Expansion Stage/Series Bs. Later Stage/Growth Investments seem to be relatively constant. It’s hard to predict whether the doubling of dollars into VC bank account will translate into a consistent pattern of investment both by stage. Some of the funds raised may be dedicated to a particular stage for example and will skew the results in the future. But if past trends are any indication and with twice the capital entering the market in 2014 the market for early stage software and consumer investments should be quite strong over the next 12-18 months provided the public market remains steady.

I watched Urbanize a documentary describing urban design and the affordances cities must make to cultivate vibrant communities. The words of urban designers echoed many of the challenges faced by networks as they grow. First both must balance growth and community. Growing a city from 1M to 10M is like adding 900 semi-close friends to your top 100. All of a sudden the community has a different vibe - each person recognizes fewer and fewer other people (it’s an n-squared problem after all). It’s challenging to maintain warmth and the closeness of a tight knit small town. This is the tension urban designers and product managers must manage. Second the most appealing cities have wonderful inviting public parks and squares eg the Mall in Washington or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Social networks also need public places for groups to assemble and for voices to be heard to enact change or draw attention to causes. Third citizens of cities and networks demand a sense of security. In Durban where crime rates soared at nighttime the government built tall buildings along a common path with lots of light and the path became a safe place. In social networks the community also policies activities and members using the report spam flags to shine light on offenders. Of course cultivating social networks and cities are quite different. But perhaps the practice of community product management and urban design share some common principles. Published 2012-09-11,Published 2012-09-11
http://tomtunguz.com/three-minutes/,The 3 Minute Technique for Brainstorming Your Startup's Product Roadmap,The 3 Minute Technique for Brainstorming Your Startup's Product Roadmap Recently I met a startup founder who explained a technique for building his product roadmap in a novel way. “We research what our users are doing three minutes before they start using our product and the three minutes after.” I like the idea because it is a simple and ingenious mechanism for brainstorming product ideas and this type of product development exploration evokes empathy from a product team which is a the first step of the Stanford d.School and IDEO’s Design Thinking Processes. The 3 minute techniques surfaces three potentially interesting avenues for a product’s future development. First it helps a product team explore how the product’s scope might expand to include the tasks a user currently performs immediately before or after using the current product. Broadening a product’s feature set to include adjacent activities should increase engagement and ultimately retention. Second the 3 minutes technique should reveal the users’ mindset at the point of using a product which has implications for design. Great product design is telepathic. The secret to telepathy is empathy. Is the user in a rush? Does the user have a particular task to complete when logging into the product? How can the product rise to anticipate the needs of the user in this mindset? Third this technique reveals the cues that trigger a user to log-in. To be successful products must change user behavior. Understanding which of hundreds of potential triggers like summary emails push notifications an internal workflow process a particular time of day or week is critically important key to enticing users to return to the product time and again. I’m curious to know if you have other techniques like the 3 minute technique for exploring user workflows building empathy and developing a product roadmap to anticipate user needs. Let me know in the comments. Published 2014-06-17,Published 2014-06-17
http://tomtunguz.com/breaking-down-a-typical-vcstartup-diligence-process/,Breaking Down a Typical VC/Startup Diligence Process,Breaking Down a Typical VC/Startup Diligence Process Below is my general outline for a typical diligence process. First meeting When I’m meeting a startup for the first time my goal is to understand as much about the business and team as I can. Founders/Team: How do the founders know each other? How do they interact with each other? Are they passionate? How qualified are they? What would it be like to work with them? Business: In some form I walk through the Business Model Generation framework: value proposition key activities key partners major assets channels of distribution customer segments cost structure and revenue streams. Is the problem worth solving and if the startup succeeds how valuable would it be? Go to market: Can the company articulate their value proposition simply? Can the team explain how they will go to market? Do they have a good understanding of the competition? The angle: What secret what insight has the founding team made that the rest of the market hasn’t yet realized? What discontinuity in the market can they leverage to win large share? After the first meeting After a startup has left and I’m “doing diligence” I want to test some of the assertions made by the company. Market Size Validation: The first thing is to verify market size and whether it foots with the data the company presented. Then I try to dig deeper into the nuances of the market. How concentrated is the market? What kinds of moves are the incumbents making and how they change the market? How might a startup disrupt this market? Pitch-it-myself test: I stop a few partners in the office and give them the pitch to test their reactions. I do the same with my wife. In a sense I’m getting their cursory opinions and some skewed market feedback but I’m also testing the pitch the go-to-market and the top level attractiveness of the company. It helps me think through a lot of the business and test my assumptions. Six degrees of separation. I look up the founders on LinkedIn send a few emails for references and then wait to hear back on some initial reference calls. Second and third meetings Follow up meetings are dedicated to metrics and the future. Pipeline: Let’s get to brass tacks and some numbers. How many customers/users? How often are they using it? What are CAQ LTV and churn metrics? How do those compare with industry benchmarks? Product roadmap: I know it’s early and hard to forecast but I’m looking to be convinced the founder has a good sense of where the company is going and why. Financing plan: What are the major buckets of expenditures? How do they change over time? Is the revenue plan reasonable? What are the key metrics for the business? Industry: I’ll call a few friends in the industry who can help me better understand the dynamics in the sector. Additional meetings/Full partner meeting At this point I’m really interested and I’m trying to understand the investment risks better. Key issues analysis: After a founder has met several partners I gather questions and dig deeper to answer them as best I can. If I don’t have the material to answer the questions I diligence some more: data reference calls and more meetings. After the term sheet: After the term sheet is signed the lawyers step in. Legal diligence: I’m interested in learning how well formed the company is if there are skeletons in the closet like fired co-founders or large debts or consultants who are owed shares or pending lawsuits. I’m also curious to see how a founder negotiates (though this comes through after the term sheet has been issued). Each fund raising process is unique. Sometimes investors will have deep experience in a sector or know the team very well both of which can accelerate the process significantly. But I hope this general outline sheds light on the key steps and questions answered in the fund raising process. Published 2013-04-02,Published 2013-04-02

http://tomtunguz.com/the-trinity-of-product-design/,The trinity of product design,The trinity of product design Yesterday I watched as a friend of mine created an Expensify account for his startup. He was trying the product for the first time. I took notes without saying much. The experience reminded me of the hours I spent in Google’s usability labs watching people use our AdSense Demographic Targeting beta product. In those sessions I remember feeling a sense of excitement followed by frustration - even disillusionment. Often the product confused users. And I had only one person to blame: myself. The Three Customer Types It was challenging to meet the needs of three user segments in our user base: new users occasional users and power users. New users need to be educated to use the product in their first visit in a straightforward way without being educated. Instead it should feel like an invitation - an enticement. Occasional users may return to the product infrequently. They remember certain functions but forget others. Sometimes they needed to be reminded or assisted. Power users want to maximize productivity minimize time and use a much broader set of functionality. Progressive UIs We tried building an AdWords UI that would progressively reveal features as the customer evolved showing more sophisticated features over time. After all AdWords is a tremendously deep product offering all sorts of targeting budgeting and other options. But maintaining separate UIs for different customer segments is a luxury only very profitable companies can afford. And one whose tepid success ultimately questioned the worthiness of the endeavor. A more elegant solution Instead of treating each of these groups differently we can view these three groups as just one segment. Ultimately each of these user segments wants the same thing: to move the application quickly and achieve a goal. They want the product to perform the way they expect and react thoughtlessly. They expect features to be logically grouped and located. They want the product to focus them - not distract them. Great products are like forks. It’s hard to tell where your hand stops and the fork begins. In the same way you can look at a fork and deduce its use great products don’t need training manuals or video guides because they are intuitive. Looking at your product for the first time every time This became my mantra: look at my product for the first time every time. It meant spending a lot of time in the usability lab. But it was a simplifying assumption that helped solve the problem for the three user segments. The core features had to be simple and straightforward. The power user features needed to be in places power users expected them to be. I’m not sure any product I built ever lived up to these aspirations but I do believe they were the right goals.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-market-update/,What's Happening to the SaaS Market?,What's Happening to the SaaS Market? What a difference three weeks make! Since I wrote “The Correction in SaaS Company Valuations” SaaS company valuations have continued to fall. As a basket SaaS companies have fallen 33% from their highs (median) wiping all the gains for the last year. To make that point more explicit below I’ve charted the total value of public SaaS companies over the last ten months. In that time period the aggreggate enterprise value has fallen from greater than $150B to $117B today. And these share price decreases have been distributed across all the basket of SaaS companies. Below is the distribution of share price changes from the 10-month highs which doesn’t quite follow a uniform distribution but shows that only one stock is currently at its 10 month high. The others are off on average about 30%. It would be hard to claim the underlying businesses have worsened since February. To my knowledge none of these SaaS companies growth trajectories have changed nor has the business environment entered a less fruitful period. Netsuite Marketo ServiceNow have each announced better than consensus earnings. Why is the correction happening then? I believe it’s a reversion to the mean. Public institutional investors are rotating from growth stocks to value stocks because growth stocks multiples have far exceeded long term norms. Let’s look at the ratio of Total Enterprise Value (TEV) to Next-Twelve Months’ (NTM) Revenue during the past ten months. The chart below shows that data. The ratio grew from 6x to 8x before falling to 5.3x in April. Let’s put those figures into historical context. Over ten years the median TEV/NTM Revenue the blue line has been 4.9x the black line far below the 7-8x of recent months. During the financial crisis that number fell but a year later SaaS companies suddenly began to appreciate dramatically in value. Throughout these past ten years and despite the fact that the basket of stocks has changed the median has been 4.9x. At their lowest point in 2009 the basket reached 2.8x. I think it’s unlikely we touch the lows marking the financial crash. Because the publicly traded SaaS companies continue to grow and because the economic environment is relatively stable I’d argue the multiples will revert to right around the median in the 4-5x range. This data supports Jason Lemkin’s contention that SaaS valuations could fall by up to 50% if the public and private markets move in tandem. There are a few important implications of these corrections much of which Jason touches on in his post: Private market valuations for SaaS companies will likely decrease for most companies in the short term and the sizes of the rounds raised will follow suit. Because cash will become more expensive some companies may choose to pursue slower growth lower burn rate models. Some startups may face valuation-to-revenue mismatches when/if they need to raise follow on rounds. But there will still be a class of outliers which are able to command premium valuations and multiples when raising capital because the market opportunities afforded to certain SaaS categories are so massive that the disruptive capability of these companies will remain prized in the market. M&A prices may decline but I’m not sure M&A activity will fall. The stocks of public SaaS companies have fallen in value so their purchasing power and willingness-to-pay has diminished. But the cash balances of Microsoft ($87B) Oracle($37B) HP($14B) IBM ($10B) and SAP ($5B) haven’t changed. These behemoths will continue to purchase growth in strategic sectors through M&A. This reversion to the mean is a healthy evolution of the SaaS market. Multiples couldn’t expand forever and instead of a run-up and a collapse we’re observing a large orderly market correction in the public markets.

http://tomtunguz.com/fundraising-history-saas-publics/,The Financing Trends of Billion Dollar SaaS Companies,The Financing Trends of Billion Dollar SaaS Companies One of the cloud’s great promise has been cost-reduction and for a while we’ve chanted a mantra that startups require less capital than before to get started and ultimately succeed. As the number of publicly traded SaaS companies has grown with time it’s possible today to examine whether those statements are proven in the data at least for those 41 publicly traded companies. I’ve gathered the financing histories of the 41 publicly traded SaaS companies and adjusted them for inflation. The chart above shows the amount of capital raised in millions of 2014 dollars by each publicly traded SaaS company before going public. Click on the image to see a bigger copy. The blue vertical line is the median across this data set $70M. The median doesn’t tell the story because the variance across the different companies is enormous. At the top end of the range Box has raised more than $400M. At the bottom end Veeva raised only $4M - a 100x disparity. So it’s clear there isn’t just one way to build a hugely valuable SaaS company. There’s more to the story however. The table below compares the financing patterns of SaaS companies over time in cohorts of 4 years. The first row contains data from IPOs between 1998-2002 the second bucket contains data from IPOs between 2002-2006 and so on. These figures are inflation adjusted and are in 2014 dollars. IPO Cohort Median VC$ Raised Median # of Rounds Median Round Size $M Median IPO Size Number 1998 42 2.5 17 97 2 2002 71 3.0 24 86 7 2006 66 4.0 16 122 13 2010 101 4.5 22 137 18 From this table we can identify five key trends: The number of SaaS IPOs has more than doubled in the past 12 years. t The number of rounds of financing each company raises before IPO has nearly doubled from 2.5 to 4.5 i.e. Series B/C to Series D/E. These figures exclude seeds which I’ve defined as rounds less than $1.5M. The total amount of cash raised before IPO has doubled from the ‘98 cohort adjusted for inflation. The median round sizes across the life of the company have remained relatively constant. IPO offerings have increased by about 40% in size In other words the typical round size for SaaS companies hasn’t changed materially over the past 16 years but the number of rounds has doubled which has doubled the amount of capital a startup raises in aggregate before IPO. At least on the surface the data indicates SaaS companies aren’t more efficient. That pattern may be driven by an increasingly friendly financing environment or because of increased capital needs of the business or many other reasons. So the next question to answer is capital efficiency. In a future analysis I’ll calculate the ratio of revenue dollars to VC dollars invested to get a sense of the reality of cloud capital efficiency per revenue dollar.

http://tomtunguz.com/performance-customer-success-management/,Building a Performant Customer Success Organization,Building a Performant Customer Success Organization Customer Success is a relatively new discipline in the Software-as-a-Service world. Consequently there are many unanswered questions about how best to build and manage great Customer Success teams for SaaS companies. Because the financial impact of a great CS team is compounded monthly and can meaningfully increase the growth and decrease the cash needs of SaaS startups it’s critical for CS leaders to get it right. Last night I attended a dinner with many heads of Customer Success from prominent valley SaaS companies. We spoke for quite a while about the best way to structure and motivate Customer Success teams to balance customer care and account growth. One VP of Customer Success described an innovative approach to managing this balancing act. The diagram above entitled the “Performance CSM Sales Motion” captures her team’s sales motion. First the sales team engages and signs either a pilot or full contract with a customer. Second an account manager tiered by customer size engages that customer through the initial deployment. As time passes and the customer’s usage of the product grows a third person becomes involved: the up-salesperson. Around the time of the customer’s renewal period the up-salesperson begins a new sales process to grow the account and the account manager disengages during that process. Ideally the up-selling process is successful and then the motion repeats. The account manager ensures a happy and successful customer and the up-salesperson intervenes again when product usage spikes and during renewal times. If not the account manager picks up the account and the up-sales process is tried again later. To enable this type of sales motion this VP of Customer Success structured her team differently than most Customer Success organizations I’ve seen. Traditional Customer Success Management depicted above has the quota-carrying salesperson transferring a post-sales customer to a non-quota carrying customer success manager who is responsible for account management ad account growth. Some companies do create a small up-sell quota for the CSM perhaps 10-15% of their compensation. But many do not. The Performance CSM model adds a third person belonging to a third team the Up-Salesperson on the Up-Sales team. The Up Sales Person carries a quota and is compensated with a sales structure while the CS Manager is salaried. By splitting the responsibility of customer care/happiness from up-selling responsibility this VP of Customer Success has been able to build a team that both satisfies customers and grows accounts effectively. Also the Up-Sales team is structured and managed in an identical way to the Sales and the CS team which could be by region or by product/solution or customer account value. This is important because it builds strong relationships across departments since the same Sales Up-Sales and CS members work together and provides a consistent experience for customers. As the number of SaaS companies increases and their sophistication in serving customers deepens I expect to see refinement of the Customer Success model. Today there aren’t many wide-spread best practices. But techniques like the Performance CSM model are big steps in that direction. Published 2014-07-31,Published 2014-07-31
http://tomtunguz.com/best-of-2013/,Year in review: Best of 2012,Year in review: Best of 2012 About three years ago I started journaling my startup education by blogging. In retrospect blogging has been one of the most rewarding activities for me as an investor. Blogging helps me some observe changes in the start-up ecosystem communicate trends primarily through data while strengthening and building relationships. It’s been more gratifying than I could have hoped. Over the past year quite a bit has happened on this blog. I’ve tried to write a post every working day on both tactical topics for startups like fundraising and management and macro/strategic subjects like the fund raising market and trends in mobile. During that time a small community has grown around the blog for which I’m very grateful. Traffic on the blog has grown from about 2000 visitors per month in January to about 30000 visitors per month in December. I find it hard to believe the growth. It’s all thanks to you bold entrepreneurs and intrepid founders who continue to chase big ideas tackle challenging problems dare to dream of disruption and innovation - and provide an unending supply of inspiration. Also this blog wouldn’t be possible without the love support and editing of my beautiful wife. Thank you all for making 2012 a memorable year.

http://tomtunguz.com/revenue-per-employee-trends/,Benchmarking SaaS Startup Efficiency with Revenue per Employee Metrics,Benchmarking SaaS Startup Efficiency with Revenue per Employee Metrics In the past we have benchmarked the revenue per employee of large publicly traded SaaS companies and determined that the average is about $200k of revenue per person. But that analysis examined revenue per employee that only one point in time. As Jesse Hulsing pointed out to me examining this figure over five years reveals quite a bit about the health of the business. Jesse was kind enough to provide data on a handful of category defining enterprise companies which I’ve used in this analysis. High-growth companies scale their teams very quickly. In fact the companies in the sample set grew their teams by 56% annually over five years which nets out to about 8.5x growth from 204 employees to 1750 employees on the median. Despite the massive growth of these organizations the best companies are able to maintain or even accelerate their revenue per employee. In fact increases in revenue per employee as a company scales is an incredibly positive sign of the health of the business. It indicates that the company is achieving economies of scale. Those economies of scale may exist as a consequence of a strong brand monopoly-like characteristics within their market segment improving sales efficiency increases in contract size better rates of customer upsells etc. But in all cases it’s a hallmark of a company whose economics are improving with time. In the chart above Business Objects a business intelligence company sets the benchmark. It’s the fastest revenue per employee growth recording 18.6% over the five year period. At the bottom of the list Tableau and QlikTech two other business intelligence companies have maintained their revenue per employee despite their high growth. All the companies on this list are exceptional because on the median they have grown their revenues 77% per year for five years while maintaining or growing their revenue per employee. A potentially unhealthy business would see revenue per employee contraction over time meaning the business becomes less efficient with scale. Looking at these trends on an annual basis we can see that for nearly all the companies in the sample set revenue per employee has been steadily increasing. Revenue per employee is a lagging indicator of success. Only after the company has hired and grown their team can they understand the marginal impact of additional people on their revenue results. But it serves as a great longitudinal measuring stick to understand the increasing or decreasing efficiency of the business. Published 2014-10-16,Published 2014-10-16
http://tomtunguz.com/how-to-measure-the-success-of-a-blog/,How To Measure the Success of a Blog,How To Measure the Success of a Blog I often wonder about how to measure the success of this blog. While there are many tools to measure page views and visitors the absolute number of readers is probably the worst measure because it’s a false idol. Feedburner subscribers retweets time on site aren’t much better because they don’t measure the true performance of a blog - what fraction of an audience the blog reaches. In order for content marketing and blogs to be effective the writing must have a target audience in mind. By focusing on that audience bloggers build a brand in a scalable and cost-effective way. So engaging the very highest fractions of that audience possible is the best metric of success. For example this blog targets startup founders managers and employees. I journal my education and thoughts in the hopes that others benefit from these learnings. In exchange I’m trying to build recognition within the startup ecosystem. Each morning I’d like to log into an analytics dashboard that showed me the fraction of entrepreneurs and startup employees I reached the day before. Alas there is no such tool. But there should be because this need is common across all commercial blogs. Expensify and Stripe use blogs to recruit engineers and others to work for them. OkCupid and Mint used wit and data to attract singles and penny-pinchers. Axial leverages data and financial market trends to engage bankers . None of these companies can measure their reach within their target audience. At this point identity systems have become sophisticated enough to uniquely identify visitors. LinkedIn with a real identity platform and a content distribution system is best positioned to provide these kinds of insights. Elsewhere privacy concerns abound and until publishers and users can resolve this problem in some way blogging measurement remains in the dark.

http://tomtunguz.com/seed-investment-market-2015/,The Seed Investment Market in 2015,The Seed Investment Market in 2015 The seed stage investment market feels like it’s changing quickly. Last year and the year before the institutional seed investor came to the fore. These firms raised between $5 and $75M to invest in seed stage companies. In addition VCs have been participating in the seed stage market as well making 2013 a banner year for seed investment. Startups raised 132% more in seed rounds than in 2012. But what of 2014? And what does it mean for 2015? Year Number Total Invested $M Average Round Size $k 2013 1531 1255 820 2014 1265 1272 1006 2014 saw 18% fewer investments but an equal amount of investment at $1.3B. Interestingly the average round size increased by 25%. The table above uses Crunchbase data as a proxy for the seed market. It includes only US technology companies. The larger round sizes shouldn’t be much of a surprise. Round sizes have increased in most fundraising stages likely because 2014 was a decade high year for VC fundraising. Also we’ve correlated larger seed rounds with greater Series A successin the past. Great companies attract more capital and great companies raise enough to ensure they can achieve the right milestones for the next round. As for 2015 the data indicates seed investors are concentrating their investments in fewer deals but willing to invest more. Roughly 2-3 years have passed since VCs and newer institutional seed investors have aggressively pursued seed investments. And consequently investors have seen successes and failures both of which inform their investment strategy. In addition as Sam Altman pointed out yesterday the dynamics of the M&A market feel like they are changing: anecdotally it seems talent acquisitions are down at least 2-3x from a year ago — Sam Altman (@sama) March 2 2015 If true (I wish I had the data to prove it) this trend alters seed investment math quite a bit because companies which don’t work out won’t return capital to investors. This is perhaps another reason to concentrate more dollars in fewer companies. If seed rounds continue to expand as I expect it will the $2-3M seed round will become increasingly common and eventually revive the old-school Series As that have been replaced by $7-10M Series As of the past year years. A rung on fundraising’s Jacob’s Ladder will flip. Given the at least decade high volumes of capital in the seed market the 2015 seed market should be just as strong as the 2014 and 2013 seed markets. Larger rounds will likely be the norm providing startups more time to prove out milestones and raise the next round of financing. On the other hand what that next round will be called by the end of 2015 whether it will be a Series A or Series B is impossible to predict. – A note about the analysis. Crunchbase data accuracy increases with time as more funding announcements are made and more seed investment details are revealed. Crunchbase data in the previous quarter underestimates seed rounds by about 45% and by about 20% for the quarter before. I adjusted February 2015 Crunchbase data in this way to create the 2014 analysis. Published 2015-03-02,Published 2015-03-02
http://tomtunguz.com/fundraising-competitive-advantage/,Why Skillful Fundraising is a Huge Competitive Advantage,Why Skillful Fundraising is a Huge Competitive Advantage During their fundraising processes founders often tell me “I’d really like to get back to building the business.” I’m certain it’s true. Every founder surely would certainly rather be building their product and company than fundraising. Nevertheless a founder skilled in fundraising can create enormous leverage for their business and develop unassailable competitive advantages. This is why it’s critical for early stage founders to invest time to perfect their pitches. Let’s suppose we have two founders who operate identical and competing businesses. One of these two founders who started a business called Turbo raises capital better than the other by 15%. This deftness manifests as 15% larger rounds. So over the life of the company Turbo business raises 15% more than Standard. That may not seem like much but the chart above demonstrates that compounding this 15% advantage over six years results in a 50% larger business for the more skillful founder of Turbo. I’ve assumed both businesses start at $1M in ARR and then grow by 300% 200% 100% 100% 75% and 75% for those six years. Turbo has a cheaper cost of capital. Suffering the same dilution as its competition Turbo raises more money in each round. Consequently the business can invest more dollars than Standard to hire additional salespeople who close more customers deploy incremental dollars in marketing to build a brand faster hire more engineers to develop the product a little bit faster. All of these small advantages intensify over time propelling Turbo to become the dominant player in the market. In SaaS these types of scenarios - where two or more companies compete directly for the same buyers - are common. Often there isn’t substantial technology differentiation among competitors which amplifies the importance of difference in fundraising skill. A bigger balance sheet translates into a fundamental and often insurmountable competitive advantage. Not captured in the scenario above is the fact that over time Turbo will be perceived by the market as the winner. As the perceived runner-up Standard will be hampered in fundraising processes. Investors will ask themselves do we want to invest in second place in this market? This perception will accelerate the compounding benefit of the market leader. If attending seven years of YC Demo Days has taught me anything it’s that the skill of pitching can be learnt. Though it may not be a favorite pastime of many founders fundraising is a critical skill for CEOs and well worth the investment of practice external help with pitch design and sales training. The advantage of a smaller cost of capital can compound over time to catapult a company to market dominance particularly in markets where technology isn’t the basis of differentiation.

http://tomtunguz.com/mega-round-trends/,Are VC Mega-Rounds the New Normal?,Are VC Mega-Rounds the New Normal? Each morning’s news seems to bring another fund-raising announcement of ever larger scale. Just a few months ago Pure Storage raised $150M in the largest ever venture investment in a storage company. These record financings certainly generate significant press interest. But how representative of the fund raising environment are these mega-rounds? The chart above breaks down fund-raising activity in US tech companies using Crunchbase data. Each chart shows the number of rounds raised bucketed by size from $0 to $5M and up to $150M to $200M from 2005 to 2013. Each bucket has grown over the past 8 years and most of them steadily. But there are a few outliers. $75M investments spiked in 2013. $150M and $200M investments have been relatively stable over the past four years. In addition to looking at gross numbers let’s compare the growth rates from 2009 to 2013 of each of these buckets. The data proves what impressions from press suggested: the number of mega-rounds has increased by 150%-200% in the past four years. $30M-$50M and $150-$200M rounds rounds are 1.5x more common in 2013 as 2009 and $75-100M rounds have doubled during this time frame. The smaller presumably earlier stage investments are growing at a good clip too - about 50%. Interestingly the number of rounds has a 0.977 R^2 value to dollars raised meaning investors are pushing more and more capital through the ecosystem at effectively the same growth rates as the ones in the chart above. All of this is good news for entrepreneurs. There is more capital flowing through the ecosystem than four years ago. Additionally there are investors that are increasingly willing to invest IPO-sized chunks of capital into private companies enabling them to grow more potentially acquire other companies and avoid the costs of going public until later. Needless to say it’s boom times. Published 2014-03-19,Published 2014-03-19
http://tomtunguz.com/data-science-types/,Which of the Five Types of Data Science Does Your Startup Need?,Which of the Five Types of Data Science Does Your Startup Need? Credit: O'Reilly Startups you are doing data science wrong. That’s the title of a post penned by Ryan Weald in GigaOm this week. Weald echoes DJ Patil’s idea: “product-focused data science is different than the current business intelligence style of data science.” Weald points to a different model of data scientist an engineer not a statistician who can perform queries and based upon some insights improve the product with a few code changes and a push to git. I like Weald’s post but disagree on one point. I don’t think there is one type of data scientist but five. Quantitative exploratory data scientists tend to have PhDs and use theory to understand behavior. I count Hal Varian Chief Economist at Google and Redpoint’s own Jamie Davidson among them. Varian’s team researches the advertiser dynamics within the ads auction and compares those dynamics to theoretical auction models like the Vickery auction. By combining theory and exploratory research these data scientists improve products. Operational data scientists often work in the finance sales or operations teams at Google. In the AdSense ops team where I started we had a star data analyst who each week would discuss our team’s performance: our email response times the satisfaction scores of our publishers and changes in publisher behavior by segment. His work provided a feedback loop to improve the team’s tactics and efficiency. Only infrequently were these insights used to influence product. Product data scientists tend to belong to product management or engineering. This is the group of data scientists Weald writes about. PMs and engineers sift through logs and analysis tools to understand the way users interact a product and leverage that knowledge to refine the product. At Google the ads quality team analyzed user clicks data to improve ad targeting. Marketing data scientists segment the user base evaluate the performance of advertising campaigns match product features to customer segments and design content marketing campaigns. The marketing data scientist creates awareness and leads for the sales team helping generate revenue. Research data scientists create insights as a product. Nate Silver is arguably the most famous of them. Silver’s work doesn’t influence a product; the analysis is the product itself. Sometimes the data science leads to a thought leadership whitepaper or a blog post or a financial report. It’s rarer for startups to employ research scientists because the output isn’t tied to revenue. But larger companies like Google do think tanks do financial institutions do. These five types of data scientists span almost every department of knowledge work. Sometime in the past thirty years data science became inextricable from the day-to-day operation of these teams. Product marketing eng sales all use data to make decisions. These teams use data to identify understand and implement feedback loops and to reinforce the behavior a company desires. To talk about data scientists might be too myopic. Your startup may need a research data scientist or one with a PhD. Or it may need an engineer with an understanding of basic statistics who can work up and down the Rails stack. Or another type all together. Like any role when hiring or recruiting a data scientist it’s important to identify what the key problems facing the business and the relevant skills the right candidate will need to solve those challenges.

http://tomtunguz.com/activity-based-pricing/,Activity Based Pricing: When Is It The Right Choice for Your Startup?,Activity Based Pricing: When Is It The Right Choice for Your Startup? Pricing is taxation. A pricing plan taxes some element of a product’s use. For a startup choosing what to tax and how to tax it can be one of the most perplexing decisions because the tradeoffs between usage and revenue aren’t always clear. Activity based pricing or usage based pricing is one of the more common pricing plans in utility computing and software these days. Need to spin up another server immediately? Did another user sign up to use this software? No problem - we will just add it to your bill. ABP offers a few advantages namely easy trial/low cost of failure aligning cost with use and transparent pricing. The low cost of failure increases product trial rates. Also the transparent and simple pricing builds trust with the buyer. These two advantages combine to reduce the need for sales intervention to convert a customer to paid. But activity based pricing does confer some costs. First churn measurement is complicated. If a customer uses a product every third month a standard monthly churn calculation will show the account churning and reactivating constantly skewing the measurement. Second building a sales team compensation plan for ABP is difficult because the value of the account can’t be measured at point of sale. Third capacity planning can be challenging because a startup has reduced visibility into maximum capacity requirements. Last ABP does ask the customer to make a new purchasing decision every billing period instead of signing up for a year or some longer period of time. Every decision carries trade offs. ABP tends to foster account growth at the expense of revenue maximization and predictability. Therefore it’s common to see ABP at a product launch ($10 per active user per month) and then a slow trend toward standard pre-purchase licensing agreement either based on seats or capacity ($120 per user per year). Some examples: Amazon Web Services has created a hybrid of the two: a spot market for instances charged with ABP and a pre-purchase market where capacity can be bought for discounts of about 50%. Salesforce started as ABP before moving to annual seat contracts when churn rates became significant and revenue predictability faltered. Understanding the trade-offs of ABP and taxing the right things with your pricing plan is the key to balancing growth and revenue predictability. Published 2013-04-23,Published 2013-04-23
http://tomtunguz.com/take-it-to-the-limit/,Take Your Startup to the Limit,Take Your Startup to the Limit I learned to drive a car at age 19 on a warm Santiago de Chile night in an unusual way. A friend named Jose Pedro resolved to teach me after dinner at his apartment suprised to learn I didn’t know how. It was past two am and without anyone on the streets it would be safe he assured me. As we sat in the car he showed me how to manage the three pedals and the gear shift and explained the how the clutch worked. Then the lesson started. Jose Pedro instructed me to put the car into first accelerate gently then into second then into third and then floor it - max the car out. Once we hit top speed in his black Fiat coupe with the tachometer reaching deep into the red numbers and the apartment buildings whizzing past he yelled “¡Frena en seco!” - slam on the brakes. The car pitched forward the seat belts cut into our shoulders the tires squealed and left long trails behind us. My heart pounding in my ears my fingers hurt as a I unclenched the steering wheel. Immediately he turned to me and said “Now you know the limits of the car. Everything else should be easy. Just drive within those extremes and you’ll be fine.” I often reminisce about this story when I look at financial plans of startups. The same idea holds: it’s important to understand the limits of a startup in both the acceleration and deceleration cases. When a startup is growing very quickly the people the resources and the business will be put under enormous stress. And some point quicker than expected the limiting factor of growth will become apparent. Sometimes that limiting factor is cash; the company needs to raise money to seize its opportunity by hiring the right team staffing sales and customer success. Other times engineering scalability constrains growth. The product isn’t yet built to handle scale. Yet others a startup might be hampered by its sales funnel. More leads are needed to achieve plan. Often through financial modeling and introspection startups can anticipate this limiting factor and plan to mitigate it early. That’s the acceleration part. And founders will have to do this again and again and again. Because each time a limiting factor is managed another one pops up. A startup should be prepared to handle the deceleration case for example when it hasn’t discovered product market fit is running out of cash or suffering from a degrading macroeconomic environment. The company should understand how fast it can slow its growth to reach cash flow break even and profitability while still remaining in control of its business. This might imply reducing marketing spend curtailing hiring accelerating cash collections cutting expenses. What would that look like? Does the company have enough capital to sustain deceleration? Understanding the limits of your startup and operating within them is critical to ensuring long term success. Published 2015-07-20,Published 2015-07-20
http://tomtunguz.com/exploiting-your-startups-strength/,Discovering Honing and Exploiting Your Startup’s Strengths,Discovering Honing and Exploiting Your Startup’s Strengths To be truly successful I believe startups should determine which of the four core disciplines is their strength: product engineering marketing and sales - and focus focus focus on leveraging that advantage in the market. Product driven startups - At their outset Twitter Pinterest and Instagram were exploratory products driven by their respective creators Jack Dorsey Ben Silbermann and Kevin Systrom who were each product managers building a product of their own vision. The key innovations were the creation of new social environments. Engineering driven startups - Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed a new search algorithm at Google. The key innovations were engineering driven: relevancy precision vs recall response time. Marketing/customer acquisition driven startups - Mark Pincus founder of Zynga reconstructed well known games of chance and developed sophisticated marketing techniques to win market share in a commodity market. The key innovations were customer acquisition retention and revenue maximization through social engineering. Sales driven startups - SolarWinds an Austin based company selling network management software created a new incredibly profitable sales model to the segment. Even today they have 50% EBITDA margins. The key innovations were inside sales productivity and efficiency innovations. In the case of each of the companies above the focus of the company was on crafting honing and exploiting one particular advantage. Of course all of these companies as they grew developed competencies in the other disciplines as they must over time. But I believe what made them successful was continuing to focus on their strengths and becoming best in the business at that one particular discipline. Published 2013-01-23,Published 2013-01-23
http://tomtunguz.com/why-how-what/,Startup Best Practices 15 - Start With the Why,Startup Best Practices 15 - Start With the Why “People don’t buy what you do they buy why you do it.” This line from Simon Sinek’s TED talk captures the power of a values based marketing campaign. Simon contrasts feature-based marketing - start with what the company is selling continue to how they do it and finishes with why - to value based campaigns which reverse the story-telling order. Values campaigns start with the why. Starting with why is a simple but powerful framework for startups to develop a unique marketing message particularly in a competitive marketplace. Starting with why focuses on values which are difficult to emulate not features which can be copied. Without question product differentiation matters but it may not suffice in a world where “Customers generally speaking see significantly less difference between us and the competition than we do ourselves. It’s not that they think most suppliers are particularly bad on brand product or service. It’s just that [customers] don’t think [suppliers are] particularly different.” Source: CEB Apple embodies starting with why. No surprise then that Apple owns the most powerful brand in technology. There’s no better example than the 1997 Think Different campaign whose narrative embraces a set of values and in so doing inspires us: Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do. Which other computer company embraces rebels? And how many millions identify with that espirit? And once Apple has done it it’s impossible for any competitor to copy the strategy without being regarded as a pretender. Similarly inside each Moleskine notebook a small embossed card tells the buyer that a nearly identical journal captured the creative genius of Vincent van Gogh Pablo Picasso and Ernest Hemingway. No other notebook can claim that. That card has mooted the traditional competitive axes of cost size and paper quality. There are many other eminent consumer brands who start with why like Virgin and Nike. While there are fewer in enterprise software some do exist. Salesforce’s iconoclastic “No Software” moniker tops the list. As Marc Benioff describes in this blog post he started with why: A brand is a company’s most important asset. A company can’t “own” its facts. If the company’s facts (speed price quality) are superior to the competition any good competitor will duplicate them or worse improve upon them as soon as possible. What a company can own however is a personality. We own NO SOFTWARE—not because we are the only one doing it but because we were the first to think it was important to customers. By consistently delivering an attitude that is future focused and pioneering we have created a personality. Starting with why is the Challenger Sale the most effective sales technique in a different form. The challenger sale provokes prospective customers to think differently about what they are buying to focus on something other than features namely values. And that marketing and positioning when well executed uniquely positions a company to win by creating an unreplicable advantage. This marketing technique applies to competition hiring fund raising and every important sales process for a startup. It’s an invaluable skill to master. Published 2015-07-12,Published 2015-07-12
http://tomtunguz.com/it-market-caps/,The Average Value of a Tech Company is Decreasing,The Average Value of a Tech Company is Decreasing On the heels of last week’s post about the Health of the Public Technology Market Felix Salmon asked the thought-provoking question above. Despite the 68x growth in the value of technology market caps since 1980 are newer average technology companies worth less? Surprisingly yes. The average public tech company value has falled by more than 2/3rds from $4.3B in the early 80s to $1.4B today as measured in 2014 dollars. Why is this the case? The industry has fragmented and players are pursuing smaller and smaller market opportunities decreasing company size. The first technology companies were industry creators monopolizing transistors and mainframes. In 1981 IBM was worth about $100B in 2012 dollars and represented 76% of global IT market cap across 28 companies. Total domination. As the industry grew by orders of magnitude the typical tech company pursued smaller market opportunities with less market power commanding lower revenues and consequently smaller valuations. So the average tech company began to look much more like the average publicly traded company than the monolithic forefathers of the industry. Today the average publicly traded tech company is about 60% smaller than the average company on the Nasdaq. The data supports this theory. The chart below shows the distribution of IT market caps over time. These publicly traded companies’ market caps fall into a normal distribution clustered around $1.4B. I suspect this trend will continue until significant consolidation takes place which is quite likely. Microsoft has $80B in cash; Apple Google and Cisco each have $50B. With all that cash and growth paramount in importance tech M&A in both private and public companies should be quite vibrant over the next few years. Published 2014-01-16,Published 2014-01-16
http://tomtunguz.com/value-proposition-diagram-redux/,Nailing Your Startup's Value Proposition,Nailing Your Startup's Value Proposition What are the pains and aspirations of your customer? Does your product truly solve your customers problems? And fulfill its promise of doing something in a better way? Most startups wrestle with these questions at their outset when they are in the customer discovery and customer validation phases of the lean startup cycle. But all startups should reevaluate these questions periodically. After all a company’s customers evolve with time and so do their jobs. The product-market fit assumptions that held true six months or year ago or three years ago may no longer be valid. It can be challenging to succinctly communicate a startup’s value proposition even to people who are intimately familiar with a company or sector. In this sequel to Business Model Generation called Value Proposition Design Alex Osterwalder and his team have published a value proposition diagram that solves the problem of articulating the match between customers needs and a startups product. The diagram reproduced above identifies the three key parts of serving the customer well: the details of the customer’s current task the pains of accomplishing this duty and the aspirations of the customer of what could be done better. These three areas form the basis of customer discovery. For a startup to attain product-market-fit the startup’s value proposition should neatly map to these needs. First the product must accomplish the majority of the customer’s job. Second the product should eliminate the customer’s pain. Last the product has to enable the customer to do more than they could they could before. It might sound basic but these core ideas can get lost in the fray of rapid iteration of a product particularly during the early phases of lean startup development when a team generates a huge number of ideas. Or the neat product-market-fit may erode over time as the customer and the ecosystem mature. Whatever stage a company may be in the business needs a mechanism to communicate how the product solves the needs of the customer to each team: product marketing engineering and sales. This ensures that sales pitches product development and positioning all point in the same direction: the right one to solve the customer’s problems and build a successful company.

http://tomtunguz.com/b2d-go-to-market/,The Go-To-Market Challenges of B2D Companies,The Go-To-Market Challenges of B2D Companies Last week I spent some time at HeavyBit the community for developer focused companies in SoMa chatting with a few companies reaching scale. Across a handful of meetings a recurring theme surfaced for these B2D (business-to-developer companies). How should their sales and marketing apparatuses be built? Do the field sales models of infrastructure companies or the inside sales models of software companies apply when the initial user is a developer? B2D companies are a special breed. They often begin as very small development projects sometimes open-source with a kernel of developers building a product to service their own needs which gains some momentum and begins to grow. In this sense B2D companies are similar to pure consumer companies. The product’s initial traction derives from word-of-mouth marketing whether through forums news sites conferences github or Apache project pages. Sometimes the momentum around a B2D product engendered by its community becomes so massive and generates such inertia that the company is catapulted into a revenues without much commercialization effort. The founding team just has to hold on. Examples include Github whose online repositories became the de facto standard seemingly overnight or Twilio* whose telephony API grew through the startup community and is now all but ubiquitous or Stripe* whose aloof culture has enshrouded the company in a mystique which attracts developers in hordes. But at some point in their lifecycles B2D companies typically adopt the B2B go-to-market strategies SaaS companies seem to have perfected in the past few years: inside and outside sales teams demand generation marketing teams and customer success teams. The metrics of cost-of-customer-acquisition funnel conversion rates upsell and cross-sell effectivess net churn rates and lifetime value apply equally well to B2D companies as their SaaS cousins. The transition is demanded by larger customers who allured by the innovation offered by new developer technologies knock on the door with much fatter wallets but commensurately higher expectations for service features and support. To satisfy their needs a B2D company must respond and change. They must learn to serve businesses. In addition measuring funnels and establishing more predictable revenue patterns becomes important for managing expenses determining hiring plans and raising capital. A handful of B2D companies have coupled B2C efforts with the B2B strategy at launch. NewRelic and AppDynamics have melded these skills to dominate Application Performance Monitoring. Cloudera MapR* and Horton launched with sales teams to capture the seemingly endless demand for Hadoop support. Others like Heroku* start as purely B2D and several years later assemble sales and marketing teams to move up-market. The addition of B2B go-to-market methods to a B2C company can be challenging. For some teams it feels like selling out. The original magic that made the company great has left or something like that. Managing culture and employee sentiment during this transition is one of the biggest challenges for management teams. But it’s the right kind of growing pain. Because in order for the beautiful technology that initially started a movement to truly change the world and achieve its intended vision a bridge has to be built from the authors of the technology to the rest of the market. That bridge is the sales and marketing teams who discover inform educate and convince thousands of potential customers of the magic. To truly change the world B2D companies must use every tool at their disposal both in the B2C toolkit as well as the B2B. (*) Disclosure: Redpoint are investors in these companies.

http://tomtunguz.com/four-challenges-facing-customer-success-teams/,The 4 Challenges Facing Customer Success Teams in SaaS Startups,The 4 Challenges Facing Customer Success Teams in SaaS Startups Yesterday I spoke on a panel at the Gainsight Pulse conference with Aaron Ross the author of Predictable Revenue Jason Lemkin of Storm Ventures who authors SaaStr and Brian Stafford a customer success expert from McKinsey. It was great fun to be on the panel and discuss how customer success is transforming SaaS companies by increasing revenue growth decreasing capital needs building better products and consequently retaining more customers. I’ve embedded my slides below. Many customer success leaders were present and I had a great time chatting with a few to understand the state of the market. To summarize the zeitgeist customer success leaders in the session and throughout the conference voiced four challenges/problem/questions they face today: education justification attribution and team structure. Gainsight Pulse Presentation by Tom Tunguz Customer success (CS) within SaaS startups is a relatively new idea. Consequently the benefits of CS aren’t widely appreciated within the ecosystem which means in many companies customer success teams must educate management teams about the impact they can effect on an organization. This can be a long process. The most salient misunderstanding about CS is that customer success is a revenue generating team not a cost-center. In addition to mitigating churn CS teams increase account revenue which in many SaaS companies can grow to be multiples of the first year’s customer value. By dramatically increasing CLV CS teams can actually generate as much more or more revenue than sales teams over the life of a customer. Part and parcel of the education process is justification. Customer success teams must justify the investment of building a CS team often at the expense of headcount in another team. Constrained by headcount budgets and burn requirements startup leadership teams often must choose between hiring an additional sales person or investing in a customer success person for example. Because the early and fast revenue growth of early stage startups can mask churn and because the impact of a customer success team is most often seen during renewal windows which can be many months away arguing for additional CS headcount at the expense of immediate revenue generating salespeople is an uphill battle. Once granted approval to build the CS team a customer success manager must decide the structure of the team including reporting lines compensation and collaboration with other departments. I believe CS teams should have a say in the types of customers sales teams pursue because CS teams often own renewal rates and a key part of customer retention is sourcing the right customers at the top of the funnel. A customer success leader must also craft a compensation plan to incent the team to retain customers and grow accounts in the right way for the business. Key to creating the right compensation plan is measuring the success of the team…which is the fourth challenge. Last the CS team must measure its performance which raises the question how to properly attribute the efforts of different teams to growth in a customer’s value. In the words of an audience member “What are the best ways for a CS team to measure its impact on the renewal or upsell rate?” Attribution is a challenge faced by marketing and sales teams already. It’s no surprise that CS teams should also wrestle with this idea. I suggested AB testing though I’m certain there are much better methods. Though well known to other industries characterized by slow market growth and intense competition including financial services and carriers customer success is relatively new for fast-growth SaaS companies. Despite the initial challenges facing customer success teams I’m excited about the innovations to come in customer success in the next few years. Companies at the forefront of customer success will benefit disproportionately from their investment with faster growth happier customers and better capital efficiency.

In a very kind gesture Ivan Kirigin submitted this blog (and Intercom.io’s blog) to answer the question posed by Disqus What is the best content marketing campaign you have seen and why? I’m honored by his comment. In response David Fleck head of revenue at Disqus asked whether the blog has ever led to an investment and whether that’s the right KPI for it. I haven’t yet found a startup through the blog that Redpoint eventually invested in but I’m hopeful it will one day. But this blog has helped me compete for investments. Ex Post Facto is my place to share how I think about products and markets and startups. In a recent competitive fundraising process a founder came across the blog and read about product design philosophy and how build a sales team. The ideas resonated with him. Without spending weeks getting to know each other he knew how I would think about his business and that gave him and his team confidence that we would work well together. Naturally I was over the moon when he told me that. I’ve thought quite a bit about how to measure the success of this blog. A while back I wrote that I would like to measure “the fraction of entrepreneurs and startup employees I reached the day before.” But my thinking has evolved a bit. Recently I read a post about Adam Rifkin’s research into building networks and communities and the last few paragraphs resonated with me. There are lots of ways to measure success for the blog but ultimately the best measure is the value it brings to the community. In particular I want this blog to help the startup community and the best way to do that is by contributing honest writing that provokes conversation and debate helps founders solve problems and points to areas of opportunity. That’s why I try to fashion this blog as a journal of my learning. When I write I’m writing the thoughts I would want to read if I were an entrepreneur starting a business.

http://tomtunguz.com/one-percent-improvements/,The Right Kind of Mania,The Right Kind of Mania In 76 years the British cycling team have recorded only one gold medal. In 2002 pushed by new head coach named Sir Dave Brailsford the team implemented philosophy of continuous incremental improvement. And the results were astounding. In the last two Summer Olympics the British cycling team has won seven of a possible 10 gold medals at each event a remarkable transformation. But it wasn’t a 1% improvement on any arbitrary metric. Rather the team identified the top factors performance and focused on single-digit improvements in those. There were three: strategy human performance and continuous improvement. and the team spent years refining strategy unique to each race optimizing the diet and training of each athlete and experimenting experimenting experimenting. I’m not sure the three core focuses of the British Cycling team translate to startups. But I’m quite certain the notion of incremental improvement is a common ingredient for great success. If the software as a service model has taught us anything it is the power of compounding returns. We certainly see the effect of compounding in the impact of customer success on a business and content marketing. And I can tell you from an investor’s point of view that a little advantage at the outset of the company can mean a world of difference when it comes to raising capital to grow your business. What’s more the evolution of traditional marketing into growth hacking is evidence at the best customer acquisition efforts are those which pursue experimentation in the name of consistent incremental improvement. In my experience the very best companies are the most disciplined ones who consistently create experiments to test their ideas and pursue constant incremental improvement. We did this constantly at Google and over time the advertising technology we built and the search technology other teams built became incredibly dominant because of the relentless focus on improvement. It takes a certain kind of mania to focus relentlessly on incremental improvements. And while in the day-to-day combat can be easy to lose perspective on the overall impact that a few basis points of improvement and a quarter might make as the British cycling team proved the summation of all those pennies in the end yields incredible outcomes.

http://tomtunguz.com/progress-principle/,Why Managing For Progress is So Important,Why Managing For Progress is So Important In 2011 a team of researchers from Stanford and Harvard led by Teresa Amabile collected daily work journals from more than 250 people at large and small companies in a variety of roles. In each journal entry an employee described one work event that stood out that day. Over the course of a few months the study received more than 12000 responses. From all this data the team revealed a critical ingredient to be a great manager: managing for progress. To be happy and be fulfilled at work people want to feel they are advancing getting things done and making an impact. But it’s not enough to simply to receive a pat on the back and a word of encouragement. Rather we respond much more positively to feedback from the work itself. When we have achieved a goal like closing a sale writing code that passes the test harness and is pushed to production releasing a new feature that a million users touch every day our happiness at work blooms. The best managers craft roles and assign projects that position their teammates to see and feel the result of their work directly. Without this direct or near-direct feedback it’s easy to feel like we’re all cogs in a machine and the work we complete disappears into the ether. Even if these are small wins these tasks create a sense of momentum progress and fulfillment. Of course every person in every company will face setbacks. The ratio of wins to setbacks governs how happy and consequently how productive team members are. Understanding the impact of loss aversion at work is important to maximizing employee happiness. Loss aversion a theory proposed by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman shows losing $100 decreases happiness more than a $100 gift increases happiness. Similarly a setback at work diminishes employee happiness more than twice as much as a win increases it. To feel great at work the authors argue employees need twice as many wins as losses even if those wins are very small. I bet the precise ratio doesn’t matter all that much it’s more the general feeling of more wins than losses. The research opened my eyes to the importance in crafting a role in the right way and also underscoring the importance of managing employee’s win vs setback rate to make sure teams are performing well. After all progress is the antidote to burnout. Published 2015-02-06,Published 2015-02-06
http://tomtunguz.com/how-much-pay-salespeople/,How Much Should You Pay Your SaaS Startup's Sales People?,How Much Should You Pay Your SaaS Startup's Sales People? How much should your startup pay its sales people? According to Pacific Crest’s Annual SaaS survey 9% of a sales rep’s annual contract value. This figure doesn’t vary much on whether your startup’s salespeople are inside reps or outside/field sales reps. The table below computes the effective salary + commission of a sales reps as a function of average contract value and an estimated quota. The quota is an estimate based on deal velocity how many deals a salesperson must close each year to attain quota. ACV 25k 50k 100k 250k 500k ARR Quota 600k 700k 800k 900k 1M Deals to Attain Quota 24 14 8 3.6 2 1.2 Annual Commission at 9% of ACV 54k 63k 72k 81k 90k 108k Total Annual Comp (50/50) 108k 126k 144k 162k 216k Let’s walk through it. The first row shows the annual contract value (ACV) followed by an estimated quota. Dividing the quota by the ACV yields the number of deals closed per year. This is a sanity check to make sure that sales reps don’t have an unreasonable number of expected customers to find. It’s rare to see salespeople consistently close more than 2 deals per month (unless the company has exceptional product/market fit). Note we’re not discounting these figures by quota attainment figures which is typically 80% purely to simplify the calculations. Next we calculate the annual commission at 9% of ACV and assume that commission is 50% of total compensation - so we double the commission to figure the take home pay excluding benefits of a salesperson attaining quota. Why is there such consistency across companies in the 9% figure? It has to do with ensuring the salesperson’s efforts which are to generate revenue for the business more than adequately cover their costs and the costs of the rest of the company. If we assume the 9% is only half of the total compensation then the sales rep truly costs about 18% for take-home pay adding 15k for benefits per year likely increases that figure to more than 20%. The remaining 80% must cover the marketing spend customer success team and sales development costs - in other words the fundamental unit plus product and engineering costs. When planning your startup’s sales commission plan for next year consider using these benchmarks. Published 2015-10-21,Published 2015-10-21
http://tomtunguz.com/box-s-1-updated/,Benchmarking Box's Updated S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking Box's Updated S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Box is a 1000+ person company providing collaboration and document sharing software. We had previously analyzed the business when the company filed their first S-1. Yesterday the company filed an updated version of their S-1. In the past two quarters some of the key financial characteristics trajectory have improved materially. In the next seven or so charts we’ll explore how the Box business has evolved. We will explore revenue growth average revenue per customer sales efficiency payback periods net income gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots I’ve used New Relic’s colors as a consistent legend. Box company data is powder blue median values are black and other company values are gray. While the company took a little longer to hit its stride than most Box is growing revenues incredibly quickly. In the last months the company will have grown more than 111% and astounding figure for company generating more than $120M in revenue. The median publicly traded SaaS company achieves those growth rates at $13M in revenue and is unable to sustain them past $35M in trailing twelve months revenue. This extraordinary growth is readily apparent in this chart. In year six Box was relatively close to the median four total revenue that in the last 12 to 18 months the company has clearly pulled away and demonstrated exceptional revenue growth. File sharing products are viral. When one user adopts Box to share files eventually many other users within a company will want to share files similarly to collaborate. This behavior engenders best-in-class account revenue expansion. Box reported greater than 30% annual account growth for each of the previous three years. To compare I’ve plotted New Relic’s account growth by year. Box been able to sustain greater than 30% negative net churn figure while New Relic’s has been declining each year at about 9%. In short this behavior is a massive and incredibly valuable engine of revenue growth for the business. Box took six years to reach $50M in revenue and is among great company including Hubspot Demandware Splunk and ServiceNow. But as we’ve seen in the previous charts Box’s initial ramp was slower followed by meteoric revenue growth. In order to achieve this growth Box has invested a huge amount of capital. In fact the business has outspent almost every other company to achieve their revenue. However in the last year the business has reduced its investment and decreased their burn rate. When the company filed their first S-1 the company reported net income as a percent of revenue at -191%. This figure has dropped by 30% to -136% in the last year to about $168M. To achieve this cost reduction Box reduced its investment in sales and marketing by 19% from 169% of revenue to about 138% of revenue. At this pace the company is still far above the norm. The tradeoff is that the company is also growing at 10x the rate of the median. As a result of a decrease in sales and marketing investment Box’s sales efficiency a measure of how much revenue a dollar in sales and marketing yields has doubled from 0.27 to 0.54 which is about 36% less than the median. This is a good sign for the business especially when considering the average account expansion pattern noted above. In addition to relative sales and marketing expense reductions the business reduced its investment in engineering as a percentage of revenue from 50%+ to 37% in the last twelve months. While this figure is substantially above companies of a similar age it’s consistent with companies in their fifth year who on average are growing as quickly as Box. Box’s gross margins are 10 percentage points better than the median at 79% and continue to rise as the company grows. Higher gross margins enable the company to invest more in customer acquisition and point to a business with increasing efficiencies. The average customer pays Box about $5000 per year. Given the number of free accounts this measure is likely a bit misleading. The largest customer has more than 95000 seats and is likely worth more than $1M but unfortunately we don’t have a distribution of customer account size or other proxy to get a better sense. Overall Box has dramatically changed its investment strategy in sales & marketing and engineering investment likely through a decrease in hiring to reveal a very special business underneath. The company has best-in-class negative net churn improving sales efficiency and exceptional revenue growth. Some may still point to much higher than median losses but this objection will likely disappear with time. The company is proving an ability to cut costs by 30% improve efficiency 50% and still grow revenue 111% annually. Published 2014-12-11,Published 2014-12-11
http://tomtunguz.com/telling-stories-with-data/,An Exceptional Story with Exceptional Data,An Exceptional Story with Exceptional Data Benjamin Morris a writer for arguably the best computational journalism publication fivethirtyeight published “Lionel Messi is Impossible” which describes in words statistics and charts why Lionel Messi is one of the greatest players in the world. Even if you’re not a soccer/football fan the article is worth reading because it’s one of the finest examples of synthesizing data and a story to convey a point I’ve read in a very long time. Data is one of the most powerful ingredients to supporting a point of view. It’s one of the reasons I publish data analysis on this blog. But data alone isn’t enough - not nearly enough - to be compelling. The story woven from the data makes an article or post or argument successful not the other way around. Morris’ article is superb for three reasons. First each chart succinctly conveys a single point. The charts are simple but the analysis underpinning them is not. Achieving that simplicity from complexity isn’t easy. Second and fortunately so the data present a very clear and consistent story. Each plot depicts Messi’s exceptional performance as a striker compared to his peers. Without such an exceptional career and statistics this story would have been far less compelling. In other words the data clearly supports the narrative. Third Morris openly discusses the blind spots of each analysis and has anticipated the readers’ questions himself which is a terrific way of managing doubt. Two thirds of the way through the article for example Morris changes the analysis from Messi the individual to Messi the team player. “By this point it should be evident that Messi has at least a little bit of skill. But there’s still heavy lifting to do: We have to show that he actually makes his team better.” Simply put “Lionel Messi Is Impossible” is a terrific example of great computational journalism. And I’m hopeful that this kind of thinking presenting and story-telling will become much more common both in the press but also within companies and startups. There are a huge number of ways to deploy this skill within companies: whittling user stories and personas from data to improve product design carving insights from sales and marketing performance data to illustrate best practices and distilling the success of customers into white papers and sales collateral. We’re just at the beginning of sophisticated data-supported story-telling. But it’s a trend that is improving the way we communicate and support our arguments. Instead of telling and opining and pontificating we’re showing and exhibiting and revealing which is ultimately a more powerful way to tell a story. Published 2014-07-02,Published 2014-07-02
http://tomtunguz.com/blind-data-decision-making/,How to Combat Inaccurate Data and Faulty Statistics When Making Decisions,How to Combat Inaccurate Data and Faulty Statistics When Making Decisions When presented with figures and numbers and statistics it’s easy to take the conclusions as fact. Numbers in a spreadsheet carry a finality a exactitude that belies how inaccurate they can be. In 2005 Stanford professor Johannes Ioannidis turned the world of research and statistics on its head. He published “Why Most Published Research Findings Are False.” Ioannidis’ paper cast doubt on decades of research. More than 75% of experimental results published in the world’s best journals couldn’t be replicated. The conclusions were results of bad experimental design biases in the data and statistical tools used incorrectly. A crisis of truth ripped through the research community. For the first time in about 90 years researchers and statisticians are re-evaluating their methods. One of the major problems with data analysis are the imperfect methods we use. Every student in a statistics class has come across p-values. Despite taking 3 statistics courses in college I found them impossible to understand each time because their interpretation isn’t intuitive. P-value measures how often a result will happen by chance. But p-values doesn’t answer the question to the answer most people care about: what are the odds the hypothesis about the data is correct? In addition to dissolving faith in the research process bad data encourages wrong decision-making. In most cases bad data is worse than no data at all. This is as much true for the research community as for startup management teams. Because of the tendency to believe numbers as fact and the high rates of error of the methods we use data has to be the start of the decision making process not the end. As Richard Royall professor of stats at Johns Hopkins says when faced with data it’s critical to ask three questions: What does the data imply? What do I believe? What should I do considering both?

http://tomtunguz.com/iot-business-model-innovation/,One of the Best Business Opportunities in the Next Decade,One of the Best Business Opportunities in the Next Decade The real promise of the Internet of Things isn’t simply linking millions of devices together just like the real innovation of the web wasn’t networking a bunch of computers. Instead the true and still unrealized potential of IoT is to transform business models; it’s enabling companies to sell products in entirely new and better ways that benefit both the company and the customer. Around the turn of the millennium startups began using the web browser to deliver their products to consumers and companies. Soon afterwards instead of paying a one-time fixed price to use the software customers subscribed to access the software. You can’t buy Quicken or Quickbooks on a CD for one fixed payment anymore. Now it’s a subscription. Though the difference may seem slight this evolution of business model has several immense and crucial advantages that apply both to Internet businesses and the Internet of Things. First companies can forecast their revenues much more accurately because customers commit to paying for a specified period of time. Second management teams can plan with greater precision hence they are emboldened to sustain higher growth rates increasing the value of their business. Third subscription companies often require less capital to grow because many customers pay up-front for 12 months’ worth of service which provides the company negative working capital. Effectively the company borrows money from its customers at less than zero interest to finance its growth. In short subscription business models empower tremendous growth with terrific capital efficiency. Similar to the Internet IoT enables offline companies to evolve their business models from transactional revenue to subscription revenue. That’s why it’s such a big deal. The Internet of Things has the potential to alter the way companies spend trillions of dollars. GE which has positioned itself as a leader in this transition aims to convert its airplane turbine business from selling aircraft engines at a fixed cost with maintenance fees to selling hours of flight time. In other words instead of buying one engine and a service contract a major airline would buy 100000 flight hours from GE with a guaranteed level of engine uptime. GE benefits for the three reasons outlined above. Airlines benefit by winning greater predictability fewer delays and consequently greater profitability. To enable this transformation GE must instrument their turbines with sensors relay the data from the sensors to GE data centers process this data predict when engines will fail and service them before-hand. They call this new business model the Industrial Internet. Clearly the Industrial Internet concept applies to almost every part of the offline world from copy machines to MRI scanners from gas pipelines to off-shore drilling rigs. Like the potential of the internet the promise of the Internet of Things will take a while to materialize. To ask a huge multinational to transform their business model on-the-fly isn’t easy. Of course startups pursuing opportunities in the Industrial Internet will accelerate this pace of change. But we’re talking about changing the way the biggest industries do business. Patience is a requirement. Nevertheless IoT isn’t a buzzword. It’s not a passing trend a fad or a transient meme. IoT is a fundamental reinvention of the way the largest industries do business which makes it one of the best business opportunities of the next decade. Published 2014-10-30,Published 2014-10-30
http://tomtunguz.com/trends-in-acquisition-market/,Trends in the Startup Acquisition Market,Trends in the Startup Acquisition Market See an updated version of this post: Trends in the Startup Acquisition Market in 2015 The venture-backed startup IPO market has remained strong over the past five quarters with 20 or more IPOs in each of those quarters. I was curious how the strength of the IPO market has impacted the acquisition market. In particular how the number and value of startup acquisitions has changed and more specifically whether there are any trends in the sizes of acquisitions. To get a better sense of these trends I’ve analyzed the Crunchbase acquisition data for US tech companies over the last 4.5 years. Looking only at disclosed acquisitions I bucketed the past four years’ worth of acquisition by size: from $0-50M $50-100M $100M-500M and $500M+ and graphed the trends across those buckets. If you’re curious the share of disclosed vs non-disclosed acquisitions has remained relatively constant over this period at about 80% of transaction values not disclosed. The chart at the top of the post shows the number of acquisitions remained relatively stable through 2012. But in 2013 activity increased across the board and in the case of greater than $500M transactions the number doubled. Six months into 2014 the number of the largest acquisitions (32) already exceeds figures from 2010-2012 (average of 18) indicating the trend of a growing number of large acquisitions is continuing. As the total number of large acquisitions has increased so has the average and median value of the largest acquisitions. In 2014 the average large acquisition totaled $6.6B and the median reached $1.7B. The median is 50% greater than the previous four years. In other words the big are getting bigger. I suspect the cause is the rise of growth capital the delay of startup IPOs and consequently the substantially larger size of the largest acquisition targets. Aside from >500M bucket the typical value of an acquisition has remained relatively constant. The startup M&A market is healthy and stable in the sub-$500m range and the M&A activity in the largest segments is vigorous and increasing moving very much in stride with the IPO market.

Left to its own devices the mob will augment accessorize spam degrade and noisify whatever they have access to until it loses beauty and function and becomes something else. Seth Godin Given the noise and misinformation disseminated on Twitter both during the election and the Sandy disaster I’ve been wondering how Godin’s thoughts apply to new information networks: blogs and feeds. Sifting the feed in search of the truth There is an undeniable early movement toward editorially curated publishing. The Twitter founders have launched the most visible response. Medium a low volume high quality content site is a direct (and opposite) reaction to the high volume noisy Twitter feed. Content proliferation is governed by its half-life In addition to volume reduction Medium axes another dimension: time. Medium places no dates on its posts. Instead Medium uses a voting system to judge and display the quality of a particular post. Blogging has used time as the primary dimension for relevance. The posts a visitor should read are the most recent - so the assumption goes. Feeds are no different. In fact time is the most prevalent quality metric in social products but it shouldn’t be because much of the best content on the web is evergreen. Content’s half-life is the amount of time required for content to reach half of its lifetime viewership. Relying on time as a proxy for quality accelerates this half-life. The decrease in content’s lifespan makes writing long-form content less worthwhile despite it’s much greater intrinsic value. After all longer content typically has deeper thought at its root. Jump on the bandwagon Medium is not alone. Svbtle the platform I write for is also fostering curated blogging. Arguably Quora led this trend by focusing on questions. Branch is surfacing debates. Marco Arment’s The Magazine is yet another example. If these efforts succeed I think we will build the internet into a much better library - a library not made of scraps of paper but of deep and lasting thought - new Alexandria.

http://tomtunguz.com/hometown-investment/,The Importance of Hometown Investors for Startups,The Importance of Hometown Investors for Startups I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man I’d sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town He’d tousle my hair and say son take a good look around. This is your hometown My Hometown by Bruce Springsteen Hometown investors the local group of angels and VCs within a startup community are an essential part of startup ecosystems. They can be great connectors providers of advice and most importantly suppliers of the venture capital to enable startups to grow. I was curious if hometown investment patterns differ across the 10 major cities in the US. I’m defining hometown investment is the share of dollars raised by a startup contributed by investors based in the startup’s hometown. For example a NYC startup that raises a $1.5M seed from New York investors and then a $5M A from Boston investors would have a 23% hometown investor share. Using Crunchbase data I calculated the hometown share in the 10 major startup cities in the US over the past 4 years. The chart above shows the fraction of hometown dollars by city and by fundraising stage for Series A B C and Seed. I had to make some assumptions about the data particularly in the case of multi-investor rounds because of the granularity of the Crunchbase data so there is some error rate I can’t control for in the data. But the data is interesting despite the higher error rate. The data exposes three tiers of hometown investor behavior: Tier Cities % Hometown Investment 1 San Francisco 53% 2 Austin Boston Chicago New York Washington 24% 3 Atlanta Denver Los Angeles Portland San Diego Seattle 11% Not surprisingly San Francisco Bay Area which is the largest startup market has the highest hometown investment share at greater than 50%. In other words 50 cents of every dollar raised by San Francisco-based startups is invested by San Francisco investors. In the second tier of hometown investor cities 24 cents of every dollar are hometown dollars and for the third tier it’s 11 cents. It’s important to note that the discrepancy in hometown investor share increases as a company raises later rounds. In the seed stage hometown investors exhibit similar investment rates somewhere between 15-25%. But as the round size increases even at the A institutional VCs with larger fund sizes skew the data to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. Though we don’t have direct knowledge of the fundraising processes of each of these companies which makes it impossible to compare the length and difficulty of each process it’s fair to presume companies based in the Bay Area travel less to raise their rounds compared to other founders in other cities. Nevertheless at the outset it’s the hometown investors in each of these cities that provides the capital to get startups off the ground and they seem to be contributing equally across most of the major startup cities in the US.

http://tomtunguz.com/kenny-van-zant-office-hours-notes/,3 Go-to-Market Insights from Kenny van Zant at SaaS Office Hours,3 Go-to-Market Insights from Kenny van Zant at SaaS Office Hours Last night SaaS Office Hours hosted go-to-market guru Kenny van Zant. Kenny is a serial entrepreneur started his career as founder and COO at BroadJump a broadband software company that grew to $100M in bookings. He was awarded the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2002. After BroadJump Kenny built the go to market organization at Solarwinds a $4B market cap infrastructure software company and Asana a fast-growing productivity company both of which exemplify a unique go-to-market approach Flywheel Model brilliantly. As Kenny told us last night that experience of selling enterprise software quarter by quarter pushed him to develop and discover businesses that have flywheel effect that generate revenue even on weekends when no one is working because there is a huge amount of momentum in the customer acquisition strategies. Like flywheels in engines which capture energy and release it to deliver consistent output even when power isn’t consistent Flywheel Business Models deliver consistent and accelerating customer acquisition even when salespeople and marketers aren’t working. These are three of the key points Kenny made last night during our wide-ranging conversation. Freemium is a great go to market strategy but only if the business meets several characteristics. First the company has to be a product driven company not a sales driven company. Second the number of potential users must number in the millions because the conversion rates for freemium businesses are often in the single-digit percentages. To be able to generate meaningful revenue the addressable market size must be quite large. Third the time to value for user should be on the longer side. Freemium products benefit from very long trial periods and use mechanisms aside from time limits to convert users into paid. fourth the initial user is not the ultimate buyer of the software. Providing software for free to users maximizes distribution and increases the odds of closing the ultimate purchaser. Last the company must be well-capitalized because flywheel business models require patience and time to achieve exponential growth. Friction in a sales process is useful. Friction can be a terrific tool to help prequalify customers. In traditional sales-driven SaaS models sales development teams and account executives perform this function. In flywheel models the product and on-boarding flows must do this. Friction forces potential customers to jump through a few hoops in order to use the product. Those users with strong initial intent and ultimately good product market fit will push through some friction at the outset. Users whose intent isn’t strong enough to overcome the friction probably work great customers anyway and would have become customer support/success headaches. At each stage in a startup it’s important to figure out exactly the characteristics of the total universe of customers that are addressable by a product and focus exclusively on those. most out of slots with minimum viable products and so will be able to address only 5 to 10% of the addressable market with that minimum viable product. Over time as the product team enriches the offering more and more of the market becomes addressable. But at each step there should be friction to ensure that the right customer segments are the ones prequalifying themselves into the product. Match pricing complexity with the sophistication of your buyer. How many pricing plans should a product have? Some companies adopt simple pricing plans with three or four alternatives and highlight the most popular. Other companies offer super complex highly customizable price plans. For example startups selling software to marketers who are pressed for time offer simple pricing plans. On your hand startups selling to IT operations teams who are technical and sophisticated buyers of many different types of technology and who manage custom environments can go to market with far more sophisticated pricing plans. Heroku’s marketplace is a great example of this. Each engineer can choose precisely the size sophistication and number of databases required for each project. There are few people who have built and advised as many flywheel businesses is Kenny and who have the go to market sophistication he does. A huge thanks to Kenny for sharing his insights last night. Thank you Kenny! Published 2015-11-05,Published 2015-11-05
http://tomtunguz.com/the-consumer-forces-shaping-enterprise-innovation/,The consumer forces shaping enterprise innovation,The consumer forces shaping enterprise innovation The first mobile phones were purchased by corporations and given to employees. Thirty years ago most people used computers at work but not at home. Most of the innovation flowed from the enterprise into the home. Today it’s very much the opposite. The big trends in enterprise trace the opposite movement both at the software layer and the device layer: consumerization of IT means using consumer channels to acquire customers and bring your own device (BYOD) means 66% of employees bring their own devices to work. Even in infrastructure many of the big data technologies driving increases in IT spending like Hadoop and Cassandra were developed by consumer internet companies (Google Yahoo Facebook Amazon etc). This trend makes a great investment thesis: find all the advances in consumer technologies and bring them into the enterprise. I think this force will be the major driver of innovation for enterprise software for the next while. Published 2012-10-17,Published 2012-10-17
http://tomtunguz.com/consumer-dominance-megaround/,Why Consumer Startups Dominate the Megaround Market,Why Consumer Startups Dominate the Megaround Market If there’s one notion that will define the decade early 2010s in startupland it’s the Megaround the investments of greater than $40M in private companies. Historically startups needed to trade on public exchanges to access sums of money from $40M to several billion. But today the private markets are providing this capital. These billions of dollars which amount to about half of all venture investment skew substantially towards consumer investments. The green bar chart above compares how private investors allocate their dollars. Consumer startups fetch 50% of megaround dollars. Software companies collect 40% then 7% for Infrastructure and 4% for Finance. Let’s contrast these figures with the total US venture investment market. Overall Software startups win about 60% of dollars compared to 30% for Consumer and the remaining two categories account for the remainder. Why do consumer companies command three times as much capital on a relative basis in the later stage private markets than in the market broadly? It’s because the market caps for public consumer startups are 5x larger than their software counterparts. The chart above plots the median market cap for IPOs since 2012 by industry. In the past 3 years 8 US VC-backed IT consumer companies have gone public and have achieved a $2.5B median market cap ($2.2B if we exclude Facebook). This compares to $400M for software companies of which there were 32. Though there are some very large software companies (Workday $15B; ServiceNow $12B; Splunk $9B) 14 of the recent IPOs are worth less than $400M as of this writing. One could argue there is a sample bias in the data set. Many of the most attractive companies prefer to raise in the private markets rather than the publics. But given how much the private markets seem to favor consumer companies this bias should depress the consumer figures more than the enterprise ones. In consumer megarounds logistics companies including Uber Lyft Postmates and Shyp collectively have raised more than $7.1B in the last 24 months. Uber accounts for an astonishing $6.1B of that $7.1B. Social media companies like Pinterest and Snapchat follow closely behind. Then AirBnB dominates travel having raised more than $1B in the last few years. And so on. In software companies selling to IT have raised the most capital then marketing then HR which is close consistent with software outcomes.. Surprisingly Sales focused companies trail at the bottom of the list. I suspect this is the consequence of Salesforce’s dominance in the category. In summary consumer startups raise the near-super-majority of late stage venture dollars. Allured by the promise of 5x larger IPOs megaround investors pursue these companies aggressively.

A cursory glance at the plunging lines in most of these names might send you into a panic only to tweet in alarm that the bottom is falling out of the SaaS market. Chicken little. Chicken little. The problem with the chart above is the y-axis. In the chart above the data isn’t presented with the right perspective. The y-axis should go to zero at the bottom. Below is a chart that accurately shows the trends. Far less alarming. Nevertheless there seems to be a correction impacting the public SaaS market. The median SaaS stock has fallen 23% from its high over the past 9 months. Every stock but LogMeIn has fallen in that period. Notably Rally Software has fallen by 54% and Jive by about 56%. Despite this recent downward pressure these SaaS companies have actually increased their value in the trailing nine month period by 21% on average. Additionally SaaS companies still command a 9x Enterprise Value-to-Revenue multiple likely one of the most generous multiples of most sectors in the market. Whether this correction is a short term aberration or long-term repricing is challenging to say. Regardless SaaS companies are still darlings of the public markets.

http://tomtunguz.com/feedback-loops/,Mastering Feedback Loops in Startups,Mastering Feedback Loops in Startups Feedback loops are essential components of every person’s role within a startup. The most recent and celebrated feedback loop is the viral coefficient or k-factor which Facebook applications optimize to grow their user bases. The [k-factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-factor_(marketing) a borrowed concept from the study of biological viruses measures the rate at which an application spreads through the network. But feedback loops don’t solely exist within marketing. For product teams there is consumer feedback and user engagement metrics. For engineering teams there’s technical performance. For sales teams there are quotas lifetime customer value and productivity per rep metrics. For marketing there’s k-factor paid marketing payback period net promoter score and others. When we measure startups and businesses we’re trying to detect when a sustainable positive feedback loop has been established and then pour as much gasoline into the growth engine as possible. At some k-factor a Facebook app can achieve exponential growth results. Such growth is created when a large number of people invite friends to an app and a big-enough percentage of invitees convert to active users. The same principle holds true for a sales team. If a salesperson sells 10 times more in software than their monthly salary a startup should hire as many salespeople as quickly as possible. If a product can catalyze an evangelical user base to drive more customers then a startup should reinvest in the product and champion their evangelists. At a certain efficiency feedback loops are powerful engines of growth. It stands to reason then that examining and optimizing each of these feedback loops is the keys to successful growth. When evaluating loops consider three main characteristics: (i) the feedback latency or the time it takes to receive feedback (ii) the feedback potency or strength of the feedback loop and (iii) the feedback efficiency or amplification. Obviously the best feedback loops exhibit the shortest latencies the highest potencies at the best efficiences; i.e. grow the business quickly in a very short period of time without much investment. But there aren’t very many of those! Viral loops tend to be have short latences. So do paid customer acquisition channels. Because of the relatively instant feedback afforded by these channels we tend to invest more frequently in these loops. On the other hand internal culture building content marketing community building and brand building have very long feedback latencies. It can take years for the dividends these investments to outstrip costs. But that doesn’t mean investing in long feedback loops isn’t worth the effort. Branding culture and word of mouth are some of the most valuable assets a company can build and investment in these long latency initiatives requires dedication and perseverance. Over the course of several years the goal of a startup’s management team is to forge repeatable processes to grow the business. The best processes create and feed positive feedback loops. Take the time to enumerate the most important feedback loops in your business. Prioritize them measure their latencies potencies and efficiencies fine tune them and repeat. Above all don’t be afraid if some of those loops are longer latency than others.

In addition to preparing our goals for our teams and our businesses we should prepare goals for ourselves. Oftentimes it’s easy to let the company’s ambitions drive our OKRs. But there’s something more to consider. In 1999 Peter Drucker the greatest management thinker of the twentieth century wrote short book called Managing Oneself. In it he stresses a critical idea: There is no return to the old answer of doing what you are told or assigned to do. Knowledge workers in particular have to learn to ask a question that has not been asked before: What should my contribution be? To answer it they must address three distinct elements: What does the situation require? Given my strengths my way of performing and my values how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And finally what results have to be achieved to make a difference? The last two questions are the most important: how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done? And what results have to be achieved to make a difference? At the intersection of those two concepts lies a plan for an exceptional year. Before leaping into 2016 take some time to reflect on how to make the greatest contribution by aligning your strengths your values and the needs of your team.

If you’ve ever harvested crops on Farmville or raised an army in Dragons of Atlantis you’ve experienced an aspirational product. The same is true if you’ve signed up to use a freemium CRM expense reporting tool or note taking app. Freemium SaaS businesses like free-to-play gaming companies seek to build a large funnel extract data from the free users and leverage that data to increase the conversion and retention of users into long-term paying customers. In the recent golden age of free-to-play gaming the leading companies developed playbooks to measure and maximize motivation. Many of these techniques apply directly to freemium SaaS products. This presentation from HoneyTracks a gaming analytics company describes gamer lifecycle management and many of the learnings are applicable to SaaS companies. Below are the three slides I found most compelling. First in gaming like SaaS better retention creates dramatically more value for the company. Although retention data is the last to be generated by the user it should be the first metric analyzed by a product team. Growing quickly through viral or paid channels is foolish if the product can’t retain users. Measuring retention is a science but maximizing it is art. Different techniques include on-boarding tutorials customer success teams lifecycle and drip marketing campaigns product/customer discovery. Second there are different metrics for each stage of product development. Initially these are engagement metrics. Next acquisition metrics. Then monetization. The sequence is critical to maximize the leverage from the funnel. More importantly recognizing different metrics are important at each stages helps a startup focus and prioritize product and engineering initiatives. This focus should help improve those metrics. Third is a list of the top six metrics for measuring retention a tactical roadmap for getting started. When you want to encourage your users to update their contact database this week think Mercury Melons.

We started building our teams with a simple functional structure: product managers working as a product team account managers working as an account team and so forth for engineering sales marketing customer support QA and partnerships. But we hit a wall quickly… Companies can be organized in many different ways that cluster into three themes determined by reporting structure. In functional organizations product managers report to product management directors who report to product managment VPs and then to the CEO. Apple is functionally organized. Product or Division based organizations appoint a leader of a particular product and everyone who works on that product regardless of team reports to the general manager. GE and Cisco are organized this way to manage their vast product portfolios. Last matrixed organizations ask employees to report to both a functional manager and a product general manager. Google is a good example. Most startups begin as functional organizations grouped by engineering product marketing and sales. As the startup grows it might move into either a product organization because the company would like the scale the number of products or into a matrixed organization. There are benefits and drawbacks to both to consider when thinking about your startup’s org chart. But organizational design doesn’t stop at structure. In the 1980s Jay Galbraith developed the Galbraith Star and simultaneously McKinsey published the 7S Framework. Both frameworks outline the components in addition to structure necessary to create vibrant companies. Galbraith’s Star enumerates five components: structure strategy people reward systems and internal network design. McKinsey’s 7S adds style and company goals to the mix. All of these ideas influence the other. A change in strategy requires new talent new reward systems and new company goals. People spans recruiting training and development. The company must decide the skills and the values of the people they need to be successful. Reward Systems involve compensation structures like bonus and option programs in addition to recognition like the Google Founder’s Award. Internal network design involves designing the way people in the company will collaborate communicate and make decisions. How does data flow through an organization? Whose decision is required to start or stop a project? There isn’t anything prescriptive in these frameworks. Rather these frameworks ensure teams consider all the different components of organizational design when deciding to restructure their companies as they grow. Remember to consider these other important factors as you evolve your startup’s organizational design. Published 2015-12-10,Published 2015-12-10
http://tomtunguz.com/5-pricing-mistakes/,5 Mistakes SaaS Startups Often Make with Pricing,5 Mistakes SaaS Startups Often Make with Pricing The purpose of a price is to tax usage of a product. That’s how companies generate revenue. Discovering how to tax a product properly is a perpetual challenge. It’s a moving target and so it requires an ongoing discovery process as the company and market evolve together. These are some mistakes I’ve noticed. Complex or unintuitive pricing model. A good pricing model appears simple and logical to the customer. It may be complex behind the scenes with different prices for varying customer sizes product complexity and add ons but the tax align itself to the customer’s perception of ROI clearly. Customers have their own unit of measure. Often for applications it’s people - hence a pricing model by seats. Other times for infrastructure it’s bytes for storage or cycles for compute. But mixing these models by charging for a people-based product in units like bytes. A pricing model for Slack that charged based on the number of bytes sent by the team in a month works conceptually but is intangible hard to understand and also impossible to predict the ultimate cost for the buyer. Move to annual prepay too late. Salesforce popularized the annual prepay idea and for good reason. Annual prepay generates cash flow to accelerate growth. Customers effectively lend the startup money to grow. It can be intimidating to push a customer toward annual prepay or to demand it from an account executive especially when a startup is young and the product immature. But it’s worth pushing as early as possible. Your startup will grow faster and need less capital to grow. Employ static pricing. The optimal price for a subscription product is the one that maximizes the revenue on the supply/demand curve. But unlike the charts my Economics professor drew on the blackboard startup price demand curves aren’t static. They change with time. In fact the marketing team exists to improve the demand curve by building a brand developing reference customers building strong return on investment case studies building the lead funnel. As a startup becomes better known the demand for the product increases lifting the price demand curve and with it the optimal price point. These effects can be dramatic. For example Box’s revenue has grown from a few hundred to a few million dollars per year. Fail to embed concessions in the proposal. When selling to mid-market companies who buy software with purchase orders not credit cards startups will need to survive the procurement gauntlet. Procurement teams are often compensated on their success negotiating lower prices from vendors. Structuring proposals with this in mind is key to achieving the ultimate price target for your product. Using the wrong price discovery questions. When asking a customer or potential customer how much they are willing to pay for a product the customer will almost never be forthright. And for good reason - it’s against their economic interest to reveal their maximum willingness to pay. It’s much easier to ask a customer to think about relative price. How much is the customer willing to pay compared to another product? In the sales SaaS world buyers think of the cost of new tools as a function of the cost of a Salesforce seat. 10-20% of a Salesforce seat for a productivity tool seems reasonable. But is this new lead generation product equally as valuable as Salesforce? Pricing is a moving target and found should view it as an ongoing product discovery process. Pricing should be re-evaluated regularly. Monthly at the very beginning stages of commercialization and then less frequently as the company approaches a the local maximum when a product matures and the company establishes itself as a leader. Beware of the pitfalls above and you’ll reach that optimal pricing mechanism faster. Published 2015-10-15,Published 2015-10-15
http://tomtunguz.com/seamless-mobile-payment-experiences/,The Two Characteristics of Seamless Mobile Payment Experiences,The Two Characteristics of Seamless Mobile Payment Experiences Paying for an Uber is a breeze. I step out of the car and go on my way. Behind the scenes Uber has identified me recorded my fare added a gratuity and sent me a digital receipt that I can easily forward to Expensify. That’s the way I want all my payments to be. Paying for Uber with a mobile phone is less work than using a credit card which is the biggest competitor for share of wallet of in-person payments. As one of my partners likes to say credit cards are fast convenient and easy. We’re all pretty quick on the draw for our wallets. Uber’s payment system works so well because it has two key attributes: high frequency of use and a priori identity verification. Frequency of use is important because I can justify the friction of entering payment credentials once because I can amortize that cost over many transactions to justify the time savings. A priori identity/payment verification means that a merchant knows who I am and trusts that I will pay. This is a fraud protection measure. Uber knows who I am and how I’ll pay when I request a cab. The same is true for when I pay a bill at an OpenTable restaurant. But Walgreen’s doesn’t yet have the technology to verify my identity in the same way. As a result I can’t walk in to a Walgreen’s scan a few items at the self-check out and walk out without being arrested for theft. It might be a few decade or so before the credit card is a relic left to collect dust in my back pocket or desk drawer. But in cases like Uber that I use often and with whom I share my identity the credit card has already been relegated to an afterthought. Published 2013-10-15,Published 2013-10-15
http://tomtunguz.com/mindfulness/,Are You Present?,Are You Present? Last week I was chatting with an old friend who after I told her how busy and ragged I sometimes felt she asked me “Are you present?” To which I immediately replied “At work?” And she laughed and said “I meant at home but I have my answer!” The conversation reminded me of a man at Google named Chade-Meng Tan. In Building 42 of the Mountain View Campus which is the main building in the center of the headquarters there used to be a poster on the wall of Chade-Meng with many world leaders including several presidents and the Dalai Lama among others. Chade-Meng distinguished himself by developing a mindfulness class at Google that has become massively oversubscribed with an endless waiting list. The demand for his class proves two things. First Chade-Meng is a wonderful teacher. Second many of us are searching for calmness and mindfulness. The end of a year is a good time to reflect on being present. Chade-Meng has a wonderful video with an opening Buddhist parable about emotions: A man rides on a horse when he comes along a peasant. The peasant asks the rider “Rider where are you going?” And the rider says “I don’t know. Ask the horse.” I hope to be more mindful in 2016. Published 2015-12-10,Published 2015-12-10
http://tomtunguz.com/four-kinds-of-social-capital/,The Four Kinds of Social Capital that Matter When Building Products,The Four Kinds of Social Capital that Matter When Building Products Though the term k-factor a measure of the vitality of an application has waned in popularity since Facebook’s sheep-throwing glory days the idea of spreading a product through referrals lives on. We all know a good referral mechanism when we see one. Dropbox’s invite-a-friend feature which awards free storage for both the inviter and the invited is the canonical example and resulted in torrid growth for the company. In April 2010 Dropbox users sent 2.8M referral emails. It’s these kinds of referrals those that align the incentives of both parties and ones that are natural to the product that seem to work the best. But what theory which frameworks can help a startup think through the rich mechanisms for creating social sharing features that feel right? I believe it’s social capital. The notion of social capital is a relatively new one. First coined by a Frenchman in the 1890s social capital reached prominence only 100 years later when economists began to use it as a framework for understanding how people made decisions. They reasoned that it’s impossible to model human decisions’ without understanding the social fabric in which people live. The best resource I found that summarizes the current state of social capital research is a doctoral paper written by Eleonora Lollo. In that paper the Eleonora drew the chart above which captures the 4 types of Social Capital. They are: Bonding Capital - used among family and close friends to reinforce existing close relationships. People with these relationships respect a common hierarchy contact each other frequently and share common values. I think bonding capital is the hardest to create online at least for now because it deals with our most intimate relationships. Geni and Ancestry services that enable users to map their family tree demonstrate the use of bonding capital best. Bridging Capital - used among acquaintances to become closer to people. Facebook leverages bridging capital. When new acquaintances meet they connect and they seek to increase the frequency of their interactions prim aryl through the news feed to build more mutual bridging capital and ultimately a friendship. Bridging capital knows no notion of hierarchy within a group. All friends are equal in standing. Instead it relies on homogeneity of the people interacting and increasing frequency of contact. Linking Capital - used among members of voluntary organizations including employees of the same company. Yammer and LinkedIn ask their users to expend linking capital. The hierarchy underpinning the relationships in linking capital is critical to manage because it can alter the social dynamics quite a bit. At Yammer asking an employee to share the service with their boss is much more demanding than asking an employee to share with a peer. LinkedIn’s invitation mechanism has the same seniority dynamic at play. Identifying Capital - used among groups with a shared belief most often political or idealogical. Kickstarter uses identifying capital to grow. One person creates a solution to problem finds an audience that identifies with the problem and rallies the community to raise the capital to bring the solution to life. Some services may ask users to expend multiple types of capital. At Facebook’s outset when it restricted friend networks within colleges users expended bridging capital. As Facebook relaxed those constraints the new friend behavior emerged leading to linking capital creation. Now Facebook can also be a place for people of similar political beliefs to congregate a place to exchange identifying capital. At its core creating a successful viral growth mechanism or a referral mechanism for a product means understanding the types of social capital that will be exchanged when one user invites a potential new user. The study of social capital and its applications is still relatively new and novel but the framework described by Eleonora in her thesis is a valuable tool to design the social interactions and invitation mechanisms of all kinds of products.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-new-marketplaces/,The New Market Places,The New Market Places One of the most important trends in the Internet at the moment is unbundling. Entrepreneurs are picking apart Craigslist and eBay vertical by vertical. At the same time other entrepreneurs have replicated the core functions and features of Facebook and LinkedIn creating hugely valuable companies. But simply calling this trend unbundling doesn’t do the movement justice particularly in the transactional web. The trend is more fundamental. Craigslist and eBay are the canonical internet market places. Craigslist is synonymous with internet classifieds. eBay coupled a payments system to the listings model enabling user-to-user transactions at scale. Both eBay and Craigslist exposed the buyer to the seller in a transparent way. They avoid arbitrating or regulating disputes as much as possible and push as much of the negotiation and price discovery as possible to the buyer and seller. For this eBay charges 10% of gross merchandise value. Both companies provide large amounts of liquidity a little bit of advice and take a relatively small stake of the transaction value. But the newest market places don’t operate this way. The newest market places don’t look like market places at all. Instead they operate more like agencies or stores. The new market places emphasize simplicity over transparency. Simplicity in price discovery; simplicity in quality; simplicity in customer support and service. In exchange these new market places tend to extract much larger fractions of the transaction upwards of 20%. Here’s a table showing the evolution in a few of the categories: Category Listings Transaction Service Vacation Rental HomeAway AirBnB OneFineStay Used Electronics Craigslist eBay Glyde Gazelle Clothing Craigslist Poshmark ThredUp Transportation Yellow Pages Hailo Uber Labor Craigslist ? TaskRabbit In these new market places the supplier doesn’t hang his own shingle. The brand of the provider is enshrouded by the service. Uber drivers are free agents but customers don’t know which limousine service they work for. ThredUp doesn’t reveal the identity of its clothing suppliers to buyers only their location. Guests at a OneFineStay resort may never know the owner of the house. Unlike the eBay and Craigslist models buyers don’t need to know these identities because the company provides customer support and service on their behalf. This unified service model provides a higher-quality more consistent and more satisfying experience. This is done in the name of driving more liquidity through the market place. More volume means more business for everyone. I expect the web will continue to move in this direction. Consumers benefit from better experiences. Market places benefit from substantially larger margin. The only question is for suppliers who operate at lower margins which they trade for outsourced support and service.

http://tomtunguz.com/maximum-viable-churn/,The Maximum Viable Churn Rate for a Startup,The Maximum Viable Churn Rate for a Startup An entrepreneur asked me the question what is the maximum viable churn for a startup? Within that question a few others are embedded. How should a founder think about trading off efforts to grow revenue and mitigate churn? What is the impact of account growth on net churn? Startups must walk a tight-rope to balance growth churn and cash. Below is the framework I use for working through maximum viable churn. Startups with higher churn chew through more capital to maintain the same growth rate. Let’s compare four scenarios of a SaaS company with $1000 annual customer revenue a 0.8 sales efficiency metric implied cost-of-customer-acquisition of $1250 and 3000 customers generating $3M in annual revenue. Monthly Churn 2% 3% 4% 5% Annual Churn 22% 31% 39 % 46% Churned Customers 646 918 1162 1379 CAC Spend to Recoup in $M 0.8 1.2 1.5 1.7 The greater the churn the more capital is required for the business just to maintain its revenue. In the case of the 5% monthly churn the business would need to reinvest 60% of its total revenues $1.7M this year to keep revenue flat from year to year. The 2% monthly churn scenario requires less-than-half the capital. This makes sense because churn is a measure of how efficient a company is at retaining customer revenue. Since churn is directly tied to burn rate and the startup’s runway the maximum viable churn rate for a business is the churn rate that enables the company to grow the fastest while raising the next round of capital at an attractive valuation. To me that means targeting 18 to 24 months of runway post-Series A. Let’s take a hypothetical SaaS company at a $2.5M annual run rate which raises a $6M Series A at 10x its ARR for a $25M post. Assuming the company would like to raise the next round at $50M post the company would need to double its revenue. A 5% annual churn rate wouldn’t work because the company would need to invest about $1.7M to sustain its revenues and another $3.75M to double its customers totaling more than the $5M raised just for customer acquisition. At 1% monthly churn the company could invest $0.8M to maintain its revenue and another $3.75M to add another 3000 customers for a total investment of $4.6M and within budget of the raise ignoring for a moment the other costs of the startup. In practice churn rates vary by customer segment. Startups serving SMBs tend to operate with higher monthly churn somewhere between 2.5% and 5%+ because SMBs go out of business with greater frequency and tend to be acquired and managed through less retentive channels e.g. self-service. In the mid-market which I’d define by average customer revenue of between $10k and $250k loosely speaking the churn rates I’ve seen are between 1% and 2% per month. Enterprise companies those with customers paying more than $250k per year are typically closer to 1%. As the spend per customer grows startups can afford to invest significantly more in retaining the customer hence the improving rates. The other dynamic at play that isn’t immediately apparent is the growth of customer accounts. In the mid-market and the enterprise account growth from cross-sales and up-sales are common. Best-in-class companies are able to grow accounts by 3% to 4% per month. This account growth offsets churn. A company churning accounts at 3% but growing existing customers at 3% will have a net 1.2% annualized revenue churn compared to 31% without account growth. Because retaining existing customers is less expensive than finding new ones investing in customer success to grow accounts is a far more cost- effective way of mitigating churn than increasing customer acquisition spend. The maximum viable churn for a company depends on the company’s runway and the rate at which the startup can grow accounts through up-sell and cross-sell. It goes without saying that less churn is always better but estimating an upper-bound for churn can be helpful for financial modeling and internal prioritization of customer success efforts.

http://tomtunguz.com/round-size-trends/,The Unexpected and Uneven Evolution of the Startup Fundraising Market,The Unexpected and Uneven Evolution of the Startup Fundraising Market I started working in venture capital three months before Lehman imploded. After the bankruptcy the fundraising market contracted as investors internalized the new normal of the public markets. Over the past six years the fundraising markets flipped from quite bearish to mildly bullish to extremely bullish. Or at least that’s the way it feels to me. I’ve often struggled to convey the magnitude of the change and its unevenness. So I thought I could do it with data. Above I’ve plotted the mean and median investment amounts for Series As Bs and Cs from 2006 to through September of 2014 in the US as reported by Crunchbase data. The data reveals three trends. First the Series A market has remained stable throughout the eight year period. In fact the median Series A in 2006 equals the median in 2014: $5M. Second Series C sizes have ballooned. The median C round is 2014 is twice as large as the median 2009. Series Bs grew by 60% in the same period. Third the difference between the mean and the median also has become greater in later stage rounds. The Series C mean differs from the median has increased by 160%. Series A only about 14%. We’ll explore the causes of this trend by examining the fundraising patterns by quartile. Before we do let’s look at a summary table of the data. The table below shows the Median Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of round sizes from 2006 to September 2014 the 75% Percentile CAGR the total percentage change in median round size since 2006 and the median round size in 2014. Round Median CAGR 75th Percentile CAGR Change since '06 Median in '14 A 2.0% 1.0% 6.7% 6.3 B 3.6% 5.2% 42.9% 15.9 C 7.4% 8.4% 75.7% 26.2 When looking at median CAGR over this eight year period inflation becomes an important consideration. The consumer price index (CPI) a measure of inflation grew at 2.1% annually implying Series A sizes are growing at the rate of inflation. Meanwhile Series Bs are growing slightly faster and Series Cs have been experiencing much faster growth. Comparing the Median CAGR to the 75th Percentile CAGR we can see that most Series A sizes have grown slower than inflation. Meanwhile top Series B and Series C companies’ round sizes are growing faster than the median. Here’s the data plotted to provide a better sense of the trends. I’ve plotted above the 25th 50th and 75th quartiles for each of the rounds over the same eight year period. The 75th percentile Series A companies raise as much today as eight years ago. But in the Series B this cohort raises 25% more and in the Series C 75% more. These trends are similar but muted for the 50th percentile startups and flat for the 25th percentile companies. The amount of capital raised by VCs in 2014 is on track to double the capital raised in 2013. This data indicates this additional capital seems doesn’t inflate Series As. Rather startups with momentum in the Series B and in particular the Series C are able to raise substantially larger rounds than in the past. The fundraising market’s evolution from bear to bull has been rapid and uneven. Individual Series A companies don’t benefit in the form of larger round sizes nearly as much from the flood of venture capital as later stage companies do. But they do benefit from an increasing number of Series As. As the chart above shows the share of investment dollars in Series As has increased by at least 50% from about 30% to about 60% in the same time period. Meanwhile the total number of Series Bs and Series Cs has fallen during the same period but the companies that do raise command twice the capital as before. Published 2014-10-08,Published 2014-10-08
http://tomtunguz.com/consumer-market-changes/,The Current State of the Consumer Internet Market,The Current State of the Consumer Internet Market Last week we reviewed the state of the public SaaS market and observed the average company had lost 33% of its value from their highs. How have newly public consumer companies fared in the same environment and what does that mean for the tech industry broadly? I created a basket of most of the venture-backed consumer IPOs since 2010 and added bellwethers Facebook and Google. Above is a chart of these companies enterprise value (market cap minus cash) over the past six months. In that time period the average public consumer company has fallen 25%. But this fall isn’t broadly distributed across categories. I bucketed each of the names into 8 categories: social real estate media gaming financial ecommerce consumer services and ad tech. Social real estate and gaming have seen the biggest gains while financial and ad tech companies have suffered the biggest losses. Social has been powered by Facebook’s growth driven by their phenomenal mobile ad success which is offsetting Twitter’s decline. Both Trulia and Zillow have made gains in the public markets making real estate one of the only two entirely positive categories. Gaming includes only Zynga and traces that stocks growth in the past six months. I didn’t include King because the company has too few data points. The financial category suffered because of Green Dot’s implosion to negative enterprise value! and also because Xoom has declined in line with the market. BrightCove and RocketFuel have both lost > 25% from their highs and pushed the ad tech category lower. Below is a chart showing the difference from peak enterprise value by stock. The red line is the median loss across all names. Boingo and Zulily don’t show bars because they are currently at their six month highs. The consumer market hasn’t seen as significant compression as the internet names. Part of this difference is the enterprise-value-to-revenue multiples never reached the same highs as SaaS companies. The median EV-to-next-twelve-month revenue multiple across consumer today is 3.5 30% lower than of the current SaaS market so there was less room for the stocks to fall. But there is a correction nonetheless and that correction has impacted different categories of companies differently. Some of these changes are company specific particularly in the case of the financial sector. But I suspect there are broader themes too: eg positive ones for real estate and negative ones for ad tech. Overall we’re seeing a broad correction in public tech valuations.

http://tomtunguz.com/done-deals/,Lessons from Interviews of Pre-Eminent VCs in 2000,Lessons from Interviews of Pre-Eminent VCs in 2000 In 2008 when I started working at Redpoint I knew very little about how the venture business worked and before I started at the firm I wanted to prepare by learning as much as I could about the industry. Unfortunately not much was written about venture capital at the time. In fact I found only two books: a textbook on private equity and venture capital by HBS professor Joshua Lerner and an out-of-print collection of 32 VC interviews called “Done Deals” published in September 2000. I bought a second-hand copy on Amazon and read it cover to cover. This past weekend I opened Done Deals again for the first time since I started at Redpoint some six years later. It was surreal to read the interviews again because some of the quotes particularly the ones about competition aptly describe today’s environment. And other statements are pure anachronisms. I’ve copied my favorites below. Bob Kagle Benchmark I was at TVI for 12 years. In early 1995 we decided as a group not to raise another fund together. It was a collective decision in which we in some sense decided to declare victory because the partnership had been tremendously successful…I think at one point in time we had 25 companies each with a $250M market cap. Corrected for inflation the $250M in market cap is about $375M in 2014 dollars. While those 25 companies’ valuations may still not seem that enormous in today’s environment the key difference is fund size. TVI’s funds were much smaller that the multi-hundred million dollar funds typical of institutional investors today. Louis Borders of Borders Books is launching a company by the name of Web Van. If you think of groceries and drugs and general merchandise that are brought to your door in two hours you’ll have the idea. ..It’s a business when Web orders is an absolutely pivotal enabling technology. It’s like deja vu all over again with the number of local delivery companies. The only difference is today we might replace the word Web with mobile. Ann Winblad Hummer Winblad In the early 90’s we took companies public only if they had four or five quarters of profit with 20% growth per quarter in revenue and earnings. Several of our companies were the first in the 1990s with billion dollar market caps. What a difference 15 years make. Most of today’s IPOs are substantially larger and more sophisticated companies larger than in the late 90s. The typical 90s venture backed IPO generated $20M in trailing twelve months’ revenue compared to the roughly $75-$100M today. One key difference is in the public markets which seem to prefer management teams to operate their businesses with negative net income to grow faster. By mid-1999 $300M was being invested in Internet companies each week. Just to put this in comparison to the beginning of the dot-com bubble in Q2 2014 VCs invested $208M per week in internet companies. By my estimates VCs are investing less than 1 ⁄3 of of the roughly $100B deployed in 2000. Mitch Kapor Accel The business plan that Sevin Rosen had invested in projected first-year revenues of $8 to $10M. My first plan was $3M to $4M but I raised the estimates. We actually did $53M in revenue in the first year. In 1983 dollars! And then we tripled that in ‘84. Mitch Kapor founded Lotus. Reading through the book now I have a much greater appreciation for the rate of revenue growth Lotus at launch. I don’t know of any company since that has achieved that growth rate or first year revenues. Don Valentine Sequoia A lot has changed in the venture business since we first began. The nature of deal-making has changed as has pricing. People are willing to pay higher prices because they feel that the public markets and company buyers are willing to pay more. The business is much more competitive and people are constantly bidding against each other. Just as true now as back then. John Doerr By 1990 Intuit had one million happy customers and revenues of $33M. Then Scott [Cook] decided it was time to take Intuit to the next level…KP invested $4.7M for 12% of Intuit… our $4.7M never went to the company’s bank account but purchased shares directly from the company’s founders. The terms at which a software company raised capital back then were completely different. Intuit would generate $122M three years later growing at least 90% per year with $14M in net income. The company raised $5M at $40M post or just about 1x revenues compared to today’s SaaS companies which trade at 6-10x revenues Reid Dennis IVP In 1952 to 1953 I was the only person working in the financial district of San Francisco who was trained as an electrical engineer. Learning about the industry through the words of the investors who have seen it through decades is fascinating. Today there’s much more written about the industry: more statistics more bloggers more books. And that collective history will only serve to benefit entrepreneurs and investors alike.

http://tomtunguz.com/management-feedback-loops/,Ruthlessness and Grit in Startups,Ruthlessness and Grit in Startups Startups are in a state of perpetual change. During a startup’s first few years of establishing product market and winning the first set of customers this state of change is obvious. But as a startup scales the company must adapt by learning and reinventing. Whether it’s building the processes to grow the team creating new sales and marketing initiatives to pursue adjacent customers developing customer success teams or handling an unforseen crisis this process of reacting to the market and evolving the company happens at every level in each function. How does a startup team steel itself to persevere through the ups and downs? Through combination of ruthlessness and grit. I’m not using ruthlessness in the totalitarian sense but in an introspective brutally honest sense. Founder/CEO of Constant Contact Gail Goodman said it best You have to face yourself. You have to be unbelievably ruthless about what’s working and what’s not working. As CEO you will have to change hundreds of times to face the different challenges in the different stages your business will go through. As a startup grows each role within the company will change dramatically through the arc of the business. To persist through those changes the company and market demand of a team requires grit a subject that Carol Dweck a researcher at Stanford has studied extensively. In her words Grit is the disposition to pursue very long-term goals with passion and perseverance. And I want to emphasize the stamina quality of grit. Grit is sticking with things over the long term and then working very hard at it. And the key to grit is mindset. Dweck observed two different mindsets in her research: a fixed mindset and a growth mindset. A fixed mindset implies a belief that intelligence is static; people are born talented and gifted and those characteristics are immutable. A growth mindset holds that one’s ability to learn can be improved with effort. Our ability to learn can change with time and that the problems we face are puzzles opportunities to learn rather than tools to reinforce intelligence. In other words the mind has a plasticity a flexibility an ability to evolve. I’ve reproduced a graphic contrasting the two mental models below: My mental model for a startup team’s successful evolution is a feedback loop of ruthless honesty and growing through grit.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-user-firestorm/,The Bewildered User at the Center of the Legal Firestorm,The Bewildered User at the Center of the Legal Firestorm Reading TechMeme and HackerNews this morning you’ll find more stories about legal issues relating to technology than stories about innovation: the PRISM affair the DoJ’s suit against Apple for anticompetitive ebook pricing Samsung’s win of a sales injunction banning iPhones and iPads Chinese hacking of US assets patent trolling and reform and so on. It’s frustrating. But this isn’t a trend that will reverse its course. In the center of this firestorm is the user and his data bewildered by the scale and magnitude of these confrontations. Given the upheaval happening at the intersection of technology and government the best thing we can do as a society is to educate the electorate and actively participate in the creation of legislation and regulation of the tech industry and work to create laws that reflect the values of the people. But when 28% of Americans don’t use the internet and 32% lack broadband access and our elected officials lack the depth of knowledge to grok tech we have to start with computer literacy. Only then will we able to move in the right direction. And in the short term it has to be tech community that takes the initiative because we have the most to lose.

http://tomtunguz.com/churn-fallacies/,Why Everything I Thought I Knew About Churn Is Wrong,Why Everything I Thought I Knew About Churn Is Wrong Churn is one of the most important metrics for businesses. Churn dictates customer lifetime lifetime value (CLV) customer acquisition spend and customer success spending. In short churn is pivotal number to evaluate a startup’s business both for founders/management teams and investors. Unfortunately accurately measuring churn rates/lifetime value is more complex than I initially thought. I was researching the topic after Ryan Shank asked me how best to calculate an average customer’s lifetime value. The more I dug into the math the deeper the rabbit hole went. Most companies calculate lifetime value with this formula: monthly_revenue x 1/monthly_churn_rate And that formula makes sense as this Snowplow presentation explains and this Wikipedia on geometric series entry shows. The problem is there are three major assumptions in the formula: The churn rate from month to month is consistent The churn rate from customer to customer is consistent The business’s offering is consistent (pricing competitive dynamics) None of these hold true for most businesses. In practice Custora found LTV estimates can be more than 2x greater than reality. Let’s look at why this happens. I’ve modeled four different types of customer retention curves below each with the same 3.5% average monthly churn but with wildly different customer behaviors. I’ve seen businesses with all four types of churn characteristics from gaming companies to SaaS companies to ecommerce subscription companies. Annual Renewals: 1.5% of these customers churn each month and at each 12 month period when it’s time to renew a big contract another 25% churn. Cliff: in the first month 70% of customers churn. In the second month 22% of customers churn. Then only 1% of customers churn each month. Constant: a steady 3.5% monthly churn per month. Declining: churn starts at zero and increases 0.25% each month. Below is a chart showing the percentage of a cohort retained over time under each model. Click to enlarge it. But here’s the money graph: the customer lifetime value under each of the models assuming a $50 per month fee for across 3 years. The three models are relatively consistent and vary by about 25%. The last one the cliff is 75% lower. Given all this variance if you’re looking for a simple way of calculating LTV more conservatively you might change the formula above to monthly_revenue x 1/monthly_churn_rate x 0.75 and haircut the estimate by 25% or 30%. A slightly better approach would be to perform this analysis by customer segment. First it requires understanding the customer base and their behaviors. How many segments in the customer base exist? What is each customer segment’s churn curve (are they cliff customers or constant customers? And what fraction of does each segment represent? But as the Custora data shows the best way to calculate churn requires a lot more math using Bayesian modeling. There are some great papers explaining this approach like this one from UCLA. Churn rates and LTV are challenging to predict with accuracy and while rules of thumb like the formulas above may be reasonable guidelines it’s important to be aware of their tendency to overestimate lifetime value as Jason Cohen explains here. Because a 2x overestimate of customer lifetime can radically change a startup’s unit economics deeply understanding churn behaviors is crucial to making a startup’s business model viable.

http://tomtunguz.com/fertile-ma-market/,The Acquisition Environment for Startups in 2015,The Acquisition Environment for Startups in 2015 Growth is king in today’s public markets. Most of the SaaS IPOs we’ve analyzed have traded growth for profitability and they have been rewarded handsomely for it. For the large tech companies this trend is no different. The public market prizes growth. Some public tech companies sustain growth through internal efforts but many use their cash reserves to acquire fast-growing startups. These public market cash reserves total $430B or so across the top 250 or so public tech companies a massive war chest that will fuel startup M&A in 2015. Let’s break down this cash by sector: as the chart above shows B2B software and Consumer Hardware companies each posses about $100B. Semiconductor Infrastructure and Consumer Web companies’ cash reserves total more than $65B each. In short there’s a lot of capital available across sectors. I Not surprisingly this capital isn’t evenly distributed. In fact cash follows a power law. The top 25% of tech companies by market cap control $276B or 66% of all the cash. These companies have market caps of $17.1B+. The next quartile of companies those with market caps of greater than $7.4B and less than $17.1B control $154B or about 36%. The smallest companies in the data set control about $22B. I Public companies use cash for many different things including share buybacks investments in their own businesses insurance working capital and so on. But the sheer scale of cash on the balance sheets of IT companies and the huge pressures from the public market for growth indicates that there should be plenty of startup M&A activity across many sectors in 2015.

http://tomtunguz.com/perpetual-freeloader/,Confessions of a Perpetual Freeloader: When to Jettison the Freemium Tier,Confessions of a Perpetual Freeloader: When to Jettison the Freemium Tier I’m a perpetual freeloader. Like a houseguest who has overstayed his welcome with hundreds of people I depend upon the generosity of strangers - in particular software teams. I’ve used HelloFax to sign documents for years but I haven’t paid them a nickel. The same is true for GMail Google Docs TripIt TypeKit UberConference LogMeIn Evernote the list goes on. For all of these companies and products harboring freeloaders like me is part of their growth strategy. At the product’s launch free plans generate the majority of new users and eventually customers for the business and in the case of B2B companies leads for the sales team. The positive goodwill engendered by a free product feeds word-of-mouth and the product achieves lift-off. All of this is possible because in small numbers the marginal costs to support perpetual freeloaders are insignificant. In the past few weeks I’ve been working with two growth-stage B2B freemium SaaS companies outside the Redpoint portfolio which both have significant perpetual freeloader populations. Like those above both products launched with free tiers. As word spread about these great products larger customers started to pull the companies up-market flourishing contracts 100 to 1000x+ larger than converted-from-free customer base. For 12-18 months these startups reoriented their product direction and sales effort to focus on these larger customers. Consequently the businesses grew at a terrific clip. At this point these startups are exploring how to grow faster. In both of these cases the freeloaders have become a point of focus. How do we update pricing to generate more revenue from these customers? is the question they each proposed to me. The implication of that question is that the carrying costs of the free tier have become too large to sustain. But before changing pricing it’s worth asking the question for any startup with a free tier of the value of the free customer base compared to their cost. Because the calculus of that decision for a company at a growth stage may be very different than one just starting out. Every business will value the free tier differently. But here’s the rough framework for determining the value of a free tier to a startup that I’ve been using: Marginal cost to support free customers as a percentage of revenue - includes the infrastructure costs customer support costs product management and engineering time marketing time Marginal benefit in leads and ultimately revenue from the free tier - benchmark the lead quality conversion rates average contract value and ideally ultimate LTV of customers in the free tier compared to customers acquired through inside and outside sales and marketing/demand generation campaigns. Softer benefits of a free tier - perceived brand benefit of the free tier potential impact to mobile app rankings or other distribution channels The free pricing tier can be an amazing growth engine. It can be an end unto itself a lead source that fuels a company to an IPO as in the case of LogMeIn or it can be a booster rocket to moving up-market and pursuing larger customers. In the latter case the free tier drives a company to support two or even three different customer segments (small medium and large businesses). This increased breadth taxes the organization. In addition to the growing infrastructure required to support the free tier customer support engineering product management and product marketing carry the burden of managing the needs of very different customer segments. Periodically examining the value of the free tier as a growth engine and comparing the costs to support it is essential as freemium SaaS companies evolve. I suspect for most businesses keeping the free tier is the way to go because the positive brand impact and lead generation capability outweighs the marginal cost per customer. But for some businesses jettisoning the free-tier booster rocket as the company evolves to focus on an enterprise business will free a business to focus on the opportunity up-market.

http://tomtunguz.com/veeva-s-1/,Benchmarking Veeva's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking Veeva's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. In the two most recent analyses we’ve explored the S-1s of Hubspot and Zendesk two of the public SaaS companies with the smallest Average Revenue per Customer. Today we’ll look at Veeva masters of the massive enterprise sale and one of the most remarkable SaaS businesses. At the time of its IPO Veeva employed about 600 people. Veeva offers a CRM tailor-made for the life-sciences/pharmaceutical industry and built atop Salesforce’s Force.com platform. In addition the company provides its customers tools to manage clinical trials for healthcare treatment approvals. In the next seven charts we’ll explore how Veeva built their business. We will explore revenue growth average revenue per customer sales efficiency payback periods net income gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots I’ve used Veeva’s colors as a consistent legend. Veeva company data is orange median values are black and other company values from a basket of about 40 publicly traded SaaS companies are gray. Before diving into the benchmarks too deeply I want to explain how different Veeva’s business is than most. No chart explains the distinction than the one above Average Revenue per Customer. Veeva generates $780000 per customer 26x the median SaaS company (the blue dashed line). Only Workday comes close. Although Veeva focuses on a small universe of life-sciences companies (at IPO the company served fewer than 200 customers) the unique value of their product enables them to command a huge amount for their software. In addition to the massive ARPC the company commands in the market Veeva leverages the Force.com platform to reduce its time-to-market with its product. Veeva is essentially built on top of Salesforce and hence benefits from all the engineering effort Salesforce invests into its own product reducing the total investment Veeva must make to satisfy its customers. The combination of high ARPC unique product and speed to market enabled Veeva to become the third fastest growing SaaS company yet reaching $61M in year 4 of its life $130M in year 5 and $210M in year 6. For the four years of reported revenue the company sustained a 93% CAGR astounding figures. Only two companies Salesforce and DealerTrak have outpaced Veeva’s growth. Because of the concentration in Veeva’s customer base the business doesn’t require a huge sales team. The net-impact of Veeva’s sales efficiency is a hugely favorable one. Veeva’s sales spend as percentage of revenue has averaged 18.5% less than a third of the median of 56.5%. This customer concentration enables the sales team to focus on key named accounts which translates into a remarkable sales efficiency of 3.0. In other words one dollar spent in sales and marketing translates into 3 dollars (!) next year for the business. This median figure is the best in the business. The other contender for the crown is Xero who recorded a 4.8 sales efficiency is year 6 but that business experiences a much greater degree of volatility in their sales efficiency and notched a four year median of 1.8 about 40% less than Veeva. It’s hard to know from the S-1 but I suspect a material fraction of the incremental gross profit must be derived from revenue growth within accounts rather than addition of new customers. After all winning a dollar from an existing customer is much more efficient than willing a dollar from a new customer. The sales efficiency hypotheses foots with the gross margin numbers which are effectively identical to the median. In other words Veeva’s cost to support a customer likely dominated by customer success but also inclusive of infrastructure costs are on par with the rest of the field. Veeva invests roughly the same proportion of revenue as other SaaS companies in maximizing customer happiness. And considering the revenue concentration in just a few hundred accounts this money is well spent because churn of a few percentage points per year can reduce revenue materially. Veeva is the most profitable company in this basket of public SaaS companies. Over years 3-6 from founding the business recorded a median profitability of 12.3% and was profitable in each of the four years. Ticker Years Profitable (Years Since Founded of 3-6) Median Profitability VEEV 4 12.3% TRAK 4 9.8% CRM 2 6.7% LOGM 1 11.8% Only one other company DealerTrak another vertical SaaS company building software for car dealers recorded four years of profitability although Veeva’s profitability median exceeded TRAK’s by about 26%. Salesforce and LogMeIn were the only two other companies to log profitable years in the same company epochs. Veeva’s capital efficiency is remarkable. The business raised only about $4.5M and then a few years later went public. The same story bears out in the Net Income chart this time shown in gross dollars. Veeva continues to generate profits not needing to reinvest all of their profit-dollars to create near 100% annual growth. Again because the company built its product on the Force.com platform in a multi-tenant fashion Veeva incurs very little development costs compared to the median. Veeva’s investment in R&D has averaged 12% over the past four years 42% lower than the median during the same period. Again only Salesforce and Dealertrack invested less in their product as a fraction of revenue than Veeva at year five. All in all Veeva is a very special business. It’s the canonical example of a highly specialized SaaS business serving a small number of customers very well. This focus on one use case enables the company to command premium revenue per account and ultimately create one of the most efficient SaaS companies in history.

http://tomtunguz.com/span-of-control/,Startup Best Practices 2 - Startup Team Sizes,Startup Best Practices 2 - Startup Team Sizes At its core a startup’s advantage in the market is the speed created by focus. When a team is well orchestrated they can accomplish amazing things. Creating an environment that fosters communication best is therefore an essential part of startup management. But how best to do it? Founders have to balance span-of-control with span-of-managerial-responsibility. In an article this week’s New Yorker Amazon’s founder/CEO Jeff Bezos is quoted on the subject with a contrarian point of view: Communication is a sign of dysfunction. It means people aren’t working together in a close organic way. We should be trying to figure out a way for teams to communicate less with each other not more… Bezos reduces communication with the two pizza box team. He reasons if you can’t feed a team with two pizzas it’s too large. Metcalfe’s Law shows that the number of relationships within a team increases geometrically as the team grows. Most agree that smaller teams reduce communication overhead improve focuse and produce more. But how should a startup manage lots of small teams? How many reports to a manager and how many managers? At Google I measured the product manager to engineer ratios across different projects in the company. More generally this metric is called the span of control. On average the ratio was 1:7. But we observed enormous variance. Search engineering saw ratios of 1:20 or higher. Newer consumer products might have 2 to 4 engineers per PM. Why such variance? The best reasoning I’ve found is Peter Drucker’s. Drucker created a complementary concept called span of managerial responsibility which he defined as: “the extent to which teaching and assistance are needed.” In other words very senior engineering teams like the ones on Google Search Quality don’t need much teaching and assistance most often because they have extensive experience. These team can thrive at spans of control of 15+. More junior teams teams new to a field or teams building a new kind of product will demand greater managerial responsibility which means smaller teams. Some startups pursue flat organizations without managers or with rotating managers. 37Signals and Valve employ very flat management structures which enable employees to self-organize. These novel management styles can be effective but only when the span of managerial responsibility doesn’t demand lots of assistance. There is no universal optimal team size according to research. But the best team size for a startup is the one that balances span-of-control and span-of-managerial-responsibility. And if that’s too hard to figure out 7 is a good first stab.

http://tomtunguz.com/when-to-hire-a-salesperson/,Hiring Your Startup’s First Salesperson,Hiring Your Startup’s First Salesperson To many entrepreneurs hiring the first salesperson is a mystery. When should I do it? How much should I pay this person? How do I structure the work? The great part about sales teams and sales departments is that they quantitative - sales teams thrive on numbers. At the most fundamental level sales productivity has to exceed costs. So let’s answer the question of when to hire a salesperson by understanding the financial mechanics of a sales team. When building a sales team there are three things to consider: The costs of the sales person - salary and performance pay The output of that salesperson - sales productivity The inputs required to make a salesperson successful - lead volumes Let’s discuss each point in order. Costs Assume it costs $70k annually to hire an inside sales person: $30k in base salary $30k in on-target earnings/performance pay (or OTE) and $10k in benefits. This means at the very least your first sales person must close $70k in business for you to break-even on the hire. But in the early days of a sales team it’s typical to see a sales-quota-to-earnings ratio is anywhere from 1:2 or 1:6. As a sales team and product matures and price increases this ratio can grow further. I’ll use 1:3 or $210k annual quota for this example. Outputs: Sales Productivity Sales productivity has two components: average deal size and deal velocity. Our hypothetical salesperson must sell $210k of products each year or about $1.5k of MRR per month. There are many ways of accomplishing this goal. At one extreme our salesperson could close one $210k deal each year. At another she might close thirty-six $580 deals each month. Any permutation in between meets the quota requirement. Selling a $210k contract is a very different sale to a very different customer from a $500 contract. Most enterprises won’t buy $210k worth of software over the phone from your inside sales person. They want to meet someone build a relationship and trust and negotiate a contract. You’ll need a field or outside sales person for that and they fetch compensation of $250k+! Additionally pursuing a few very large contracts introduces huge variance in sales forecasting. It’s called elephant hunting for a reason - high risk high reward. As a startup with presumably constrained finances the ideal first sales person produces predictable and consistent sales. This is better for performance measurement (understanding how well the sales person is doing) and cash flow management (ensuring sales is filling the coffers early and often). As a result in addition to a quota sales managers often prescribe a sales velocity or the number of deals closed within a period. Sales velocity is dependent on your product’s price and the total number of customer contacts a salesperson can make in a month. In a month the average salesperson has the time to convert 60 leads to customers. Assume a sales person works 20 days per month for 9 hours per day. Assume each sales call takes 45 minutes of time 15 minutes of preparation/followup and each sale requires 3 calls (introduction product demo and close) and voila - 60 leads. But not all leads convert. Typical conversion rates for inside sales teams are roughly 20%. Of the 60 leads only 12 will likely convert to customers. Those 12 customers need to produce about $121 of MRR quota each which implies a pricing floor of $1400 per year. Changing the figures in the funnel in particular the close rates and the ratio of OTE to bookings will alter this figure and the sales' teams profitability. Inputs: Leads Our sales person must contact 60 qualified leads users with intent to convert to paying customers to achieve quota. To satisfy that monthly demand the product and marketing teams must attract enough new users and qualify leads through the funnel. Otherwise the salesperson will lack the leads to be successful. Freemium businesses convert about 2 to 4% of new user accounts into paying customers. More traditional enterprise sales tend to convert 10 to 15% of leads (people signing up on the home page asking for information). A freemium business needs to generate about 3000 users that could pay $800 per month to gin up 60 qualified leads each month. And a traditional enterprise software startup needs to create 400 signups. Until your startup is filling the top of the sales pipeline with roughly these numbers you risk hiring a salesperson too early. Other things to consider There are many other factors to consider when laying the foundation for your sales team including customer churn rates customer costs to serve (account management) payback periods contract requirements sales person experience internal time allocation and so on. But when your startup’s software can command a high enough price and when your lead volumes reach a certain threshold you should have the confidence to hire your first salesperson.

http://tomtunguz.com/how-will-i-enable-greatness-today/,How Will I Enable Greatness Today?,How Will I Enable Greatness Today? In the summer of 2008 a crisis evolved on my team at Google: social networks had grown exponentially. The AdSense network was flooded with social network page impressions whose poor performance challenged advertisers and Google alike. During that summer we formed a tiger team of about four or five key people. We shed our daily responsibilities relocated our desks to a conference room in a deserted building on the edge of campus where we brainstormed and debated and wrote patents and developed a plan of action. Those few weeks were some of the most productive of my time at Google. Reading through Ken Segall’s book Insanely Simple: The Obsession that Drives Apple’s Success I came across this passage which reminded me of the summer spent on that tiger team. There are many who believe Steve Jobs was a creative genius. I think it would be more accurate to say he was a genius who loved creativity. Jobs greatest strength may have been clearing the way for creative people to achieve their potential. Segall argues Jobs' relentless defense of creativity made him and his companies great. Creativity blossoms in environments of mercilessly small teams honest/direct/brutal feedback and “no compromises” attitudes. Practically speaking this means deploying small teams on projects and constraining meeting sizes; empowering/trusting these small teams to make bold strides; hiring well; providing clear direction and honest feedback - ultimately enabling faster iteration cycles for better results. But it doesn’t take a crisis to form tiger teams or champion and defend creativity. We can do these things every day. It’s about waking up in the morning and asking “How will I enable greatness today?” Published 2013-05-10,Published 2013-05-10
http://tomtunguz.com/when-hire-first-vp-sales/,When Do SaaS Startups Hire Their First VP of Sales,When Do SaaS Startups Hire Their First VP of Sales The prevailing wisdom for hiring the first VP of Sales is roughly $1M in ARR or whenever the company has figured out some repeatable sales process. The rationale behind this advice is at this point the company needs someone to build recruit incentivize coach and manage the team that will grow to acquire more and more business. While that all makes sense I was curious to see if startups do this in practice and whether the timing of the VPS differs by ACV. I catalogued the first VPS hire for about 20 fast growth SaaS companies founded in the past five or so years and compared it to the date they were founded. The histogram above shows most of the time fast-growth SaaS companies hire a VPS in the third year after they were founded. Since it can take 3-9 months to find a great VPS for the company this means these startups began their search about 2 years in. This pattern of hiring a VPS about three years after the founding of the company transcends the average revenue per customer. Each startup fits into the SMB bucket of Average Revenue per Customer < $15k Enterprise of ARPC > $100k and Mid-Market which is in between. Just a reminder about box plots: the top part of the box is the 75% percentile the bottom part of the box is the 25% the middle is the 50% and the lines show the range and the dots indicate outliers. Regardless of the typical size of these SaaS companies’ customers the typical company hires the first VP of Sales in the 2.75 year to 3.25 year span. There’s no statistically significant difference across these buckets. Before this analysis I would have suspected that Enterprise-focused companies would have brought in a VPS much earlier since the sales cycles are long the stakes are high and a relevant rolodex is valuable at the outset. But this clearly isn’t the case. It is important to note that the Midmarket companies have the greatest variance. I suspect it is because a few of the Midmarket companies have founders and CEOs with sales backgrounds and with that expertise in house the company can scale well for a year or so more before hiring. While this chart doesn’t show ARR information we can’t validate the $1M ARR advice. But the data is very consistent with the timing of when a fast-growth company should achieve those revenue numbers. The typical SaaS company will be founded develop a product find some customers raise a seed 9 months later learn a bit about the sales process raise a Series A 12 months later and then start a VPS search. And often it’s the cash from this second round that enables the company to afford a VPS and the sales team. Published 2015-08-05,Published 2015-08-05

http://tomtunguz.com/mailchimp/,The Single Best Content Marketing Channel for Your Startup; Email and RSS Conversion Funnels; Other Interesting Data Points from the Analysis; The Story in Charts; Perform this Analysis for Your Content,The Single Best Content Marketing Channel for Your Startup The single best content marketing channel is email subscriptions powered by Twitter/social media distribution. Thirty days ago I began an experiment with this blog to determine whether email Twitter or RSS would be the better content marketing channel. My goals with RSS Twitter and email are two: first to maintain a relationship with a reader longer than a single website visit by creating a communication channel and second to use that marketing channel to drive re-engagement. Below I’ve analyzed the results and come across some surprising findings. First RSS subscribers generate more traffic than email subscribers. Second email readers are much easier to win than RSS readers. Third email and RSS subscribers tend to be very different audiences and these channels do not cannibalize each other. Fourth Twitter’s performance on a unit basis pales in comparison to its competition but makes it up in volume. Note the code to perform a web rss and email analysis is at the bottom of this post in case you’re interested in analyzing your startup’s content marketing effectiveness. Email and RSS Conversion Funnels Email and RSS subscribers open blog posts at roughly equal rates; RSS is a moderate 21% better. But 2.5x more people click through to the website from RSS as from email. When RSS subscribers do come to the website they browse about half as many pages as email subscribers. Net-net the average RSS subscriber generates about 25% more page views than an email subscriber. The most effective content marketing strategy is to combine Twitter’s distribution capacity with email’s conversion rates and broad applicability. Email RSS Twitter Delta Open Rate 51% 62% n/a 21% better for RSS Click through to site 23% 80% 4.5% 250% better for RSS Page views per visit 2.3 1.2 2.0 91% better for email Expected Page Views per 100 Subscribers 127 159 9 25% better for RSS Subscriber Volumes 454 1567 9874 530% better for Twitter Other Interesting Data Points from the Analysis Absolutely no one forwards the Mailchimp emails. Of 6500+ emails sent 0 were forwarded. On average this blog acquires 13 new email subscribers daily which is roughly equal to the number of new organic Twitter followers added per day 15 and about 4 times greater than the 4 new RSS subscribers per day in the same period. At current course and speed I expect email to surpass RSS in 64 days’ time. 0.3% of visitors to the blog subscribe via email. I don’t have a comparable RSS metric because of the way Feedburner collects these figures. 3% of email subscribers or about 13 people have unsubscribed in the past 30 days. Given that small volume I assume no cannibalization and no overlap in user base with RSS which counts about 1500 subscribers. Email subscription growth has a weak correlation to traffic only about 0.58 R 2. This means that traffic spikes typically generate traffic that bounces - visits once and doesn’t return. I wish I could cookie users and understand how many impressions it takes to entice someone to become a subscriber. RSS CTRs are 3x greater than the emails despite the fact that I syndicate full blog posts into the feed. I’m not sure what the driver is here The Story in Charts Traffic is indicated in gray new subscribers in red and unsubscribers in blue. Email signups are volatile and aren’t tightly coupled to traffic meaning the blog fails to convert many new visitors driven by large volumes of retweets or HackerNews traffic spikes to subscribers. This chart shows share of traffic by channel. Email has grown from about 0 to 15% in 30 days. RSS is also growing and has reached about 20% of page views. Twitter represents about 23% of traffic. On an average day about 55 to 60% of traffic is brought to this blog through reader marketing channels. The figures are incredibly volatile however.

All of the businesses we’ve looked at in the past have been purely SaaS businesses. Today we’ll examine Tableau the market leader for data visualization software. Tableau sells software the old-fashioned way with perpetual licenses not subscriptions. Customers pay a fee for the software up-front in addition to an annual maintenance fee of about 20-25%. To offset the mostly one-time payment from customers Tableau employs a land-and-expand strategy. The company went public in 2013 and we’ll use data from their S-1 through 2013 to benchmark the business. Tableau sells their desktop client to one or two data analysts within a company. Many times these first analysts download the product on the web and convert to paid with a credit card. Over time colleagues within the company see the software and purchase it for themselves. Sometimes teams buy a Tableau server license to collaborate internally on data analysis. When enough employees of a company use Tableau the company is able to sell an enterprise-wide license but these very large transactions are still quite few in number. Tableau closed 179 transactions of greater than $100k ACVs in the first quarter of the year up from 80 three quarters before. In the next seven charts we’ll explore how Tableau built their business. We will explore revenue growth average revenue per customer sales efficiency payback periods net income gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots I’ve used Tableau’s colors as a consistent legend. Tableau company data is blue median values are black and other company values from a basket of about 40 publicly traded SaaS companies are gray. Founded in 2003 Tableau followed a more gradual revenue growth curve than the median SaaS company. But since the company hit its stride about six years after founding Tableau has been growing rapidly recording a 94% CAGR for the last four years and generating $232M of revenue in 2013. 70% of that revenue is one-time software license fees and 30% is recurring service and support. Tableau does sell a SaaS product (a hosted version of its desktop client) but the most recent quarterly reports indicate the revenue contribution is de minimus. At IPO Tableau’s average customer paid $12773 for roughly six to seven seats. This average revenue per customer (ARPC) places the company in the 25% percentile for size of ARPC and below the median of $29k indicated as the dashed blue line in the chart above. As mentioned above these small initial deployments ultimately lead to much larger enterprise licenses measuring at least in the five figures and the pricing is part-and-parcel of the land and expand strategy. Tableau has the best gross margins of any company in the SaaS basket 92% compared to the median of 68%. Tableau’s margins are thirty-five percent better than the median SaaS publicly traded company for two reasons. First Tableau’s software is sold as a client an application users download to their machines and run in place so there are no ongoing hosting or server costs. Second customers pay for their own customer support and success as part of a typical deployment. Instead of contributing to the cost of revenue customer success is a revenue line item. Tableau’s sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue traces the median at about 50%. While there is nothing special about this figure there is about the next one. For every sales and marketing dollar Tableau invests the business returns more than $1.54. Only LinkedIn and DealerTrak have better sales efficiencies for companies this “mature” (seven years or more since being founded). Tableau achieves such terrific efficiencies by combining a freemium product with focused account expansion sales effort. Since the ultimate purpose of data analysis is to share insight the software’s end product data visualization is often distributed broadly within its customers’ companies engendering new interest which can be converted into account growth by the sales team. Perhaps as a consequence of remarkable sales efficiency Tableau has required very little capital to grow. The founders raised only $15M before taking the company public. At the end of 2012 six months before the company would trade publicly the business counted $39.3M of cash on its balance sheet meaning the business either hadn’t spent very much of the capital it raised or had spent it early and then replenished its cash balance with profits over time. Since at least 2010 Tableau has been run profitably. In each of the years we have data on the business the company never exceeded $8M in net income and this is likely because the company plows all the potential profits back into customer acquisition and upsell. Tableau is among the slowest companies in the set above to reach the $50M revenue milestone taking 8 years to exceed it. Tableau’s cash-conservative approach may have been necessary given the perpetual sales model. Tableau could count only on about 25% of their revenue to recur the support and maintenance fees. Describing the business through a SaaS lens one might say Tableau charges a higher upfront price than a SaaS product might but suffers from roughly 10-11% monthly revenue churn. Managing this type of business is very different from today’s SaaS model and the increased unpredictability of customer behavior likely demanded a more conservative operating plan. Tableau spends 26% of revenues on research and development about 37% more than the median SaaS company. And they have been investing at this rate for as long as we have data to measure it. It may be that client software is more expensive to develop and maintain or that the footprint of the software is more expansive and requires greater development effort. There is a tradeoff between the predictability of the SaaS business model and the margins of a perpetual license model. Tableau has been able to grow very much like a SaaS company and arguably required less capital though it has taken the business some more time to achieve the milestones and the company doesn’t benefit from the long-term revenue streams that subscription customers offer. As the company scales I expect to see Tableau experiment with generating more consistent and likely subscription revenue from existing customers either with subscription products paid upgrades more collaboration or other features. Tableau is an impressive company for many reasons: terrific revenue growth tremendous sales efficiency and a beautiful product. For founders it serves as a great role model for building a perpetual license business and a foil for the SaaS model of commonplace today. Published 2014-09-22,Published 2014-09-22
http://tomtunguz.com/ariba-history/,From $800k to $274M in 4 Years - The Story of Ariba,From $800k to $274M in 4 Years - The Story of Ariba Ariba went public in 1999 three years after having been founded. In its first year of selling the company generated $800000 in revenue. Then it ramped. $8 million then $45 million then $274M. In a three-year period the company had grown 33x and achieved an astounding CAGR of 224% over the same period. Ariba shares increased 300% on its first day of trading at IPO valuing the company at $6 billion. At its peak the company would be worth $40 billion but after the dotcom crash the share price returned from the stratosphere to normal levels. Ultimately SAP acquired the company in 2012 for $4.6B. Before it’s acquisition which was consummated at the highest historical multiple of any software company Ariba was the largest independent procurement software business. It sold software to help businesses buy the things they need in order to operate everything from pens to planes. In particular Ariba sold software to run RFPs manage contracts with suppliers analyze corporate spending and ensure financial compliance. Another unique characteristic about the story of Ariba: the founding team was seven people. At the outset Ariba sustained very high gross margins in the low 80 percentile range. Over time as the company began to serve larger customers and began offering customization of their procurement software the gross margins dipped reaching its nadir in 2006 at 46%. At this point in time Ariba generated 56% of its revenue from professional services which dramatically depressed because margins. Over time the company would reduce professional services to about 33%. Ariba’s growth was remarkably efficient. The company spent $46.4M in sales and marketing efforts in the years before generating more than $200 million in revenue. At the time of its IPO the company was only investing about 75% of its revenue and sales and marketing. After the company successfully completed its IPO the company would increase its annual sales and marketing budget by 6X year-over-year to $230M and $298M in 2000 and 2001 at precisely the wrong time. The market would correct shortly thereafter. Ariba enjoyed terrific sales efficiency through its first three years. The company started to rapid build a marketing expense in 2001 and the market fell out from underneath them the sales efficiency dropped dramatically and the company actually recorded a negative sales efficiency. In 2002 the company invested significantly in sales and marketing but suffered a decline in revenue. Presumably this is due to customer churn as a fair number of their customers must have gone out of business. Additionally Ariba spent relatively modest fraction of their revenue on engineering efforts. In a typical year the company invested about 20 to 30% of their revenue in research and development. Of course given the large size of professional services contracts a fair amount of custom software development was completed at the behest of customers. Ariba attained profitability in 2009 for the first time. But the company has been operating at close to breakeven since 2004. The notable dip in 2001 when Ariba notched a loss of $2.7B or -674% net income as a percentage of revenue figure. Ariba acquired a company called Tradex technologies for $1.6B in 1999 and ultimately wrote off about $1.4B which had to be recognized in the period from 2000 to 2002. Similar to net income Ariba sustained cash flow breakeven for the first time in 2009 but flirted with the mark since about 2004. In the end Ariba’s team built a rocketship that grew incredibly quickly weathered quite a bit of market turbulence and ultimately created a lasting business that still defines the procurement industry today.

http://tomtunguz.com/searching-for-eric-schmidt/,Searching for Eric Schmidt,Searching for Eric Schmidt For over two years Larry and Sergey met CEO candidates before deciding to hire Eric Schmidt. Hiring a CEO was a condition investors imposed as part of the Series A terms. After the investment closed the founders wanted to renege on that part of the agreement but the board asked the duo to meet some of the valley’s top CEOs. At which point Larry and Sergey only wanted to hire Steve Jobs. Eventually they found and hired Eric. From Netflix to Facebook Twitter to Google successful startups build great management teams. But it isn’t easy to hire an executive of any sort (CEO VP Marketing VP of Sales etc) because the executive hiring process is radically different from every previous hire in the startup’s life. It’s the first hire that requires trust. The Perfect Process During the early stages of a startup founders perfect the art of hiring individual contributors employees who are hired to accomplish particular tasks. Cofounders join forces often because of their complimentary tactical skills: product manager meets engineer. Then the co-founders scale the engineering team to code faster. Next the company hires a young salesperson or entry-level marketer. The hiring processes for each of these roles is similar: interviewers test core relevant skills during the interview with coding challenges mock sales pitches brainteasers marketing funnel optimization and so on. All of these tests are tactical tests for individual contributor roles. But what skills do you test in a CEO interview? Or a head of marketing search? And once hired how is the candidate evaluated? By definition these roles are management roles not individual contributor roles so the tactical tests aren’t the right ones. Which means the interview and evaluation process is different and new and scary. Time to Failure What’s more the time to failure for a management hire is much longer than a new lackluster individual contributor whose subpar performance is noticed immediately. Unlike individual contributors managers are hired to build teams. Your new head of sales will hire a team of 1 to 3 people in the next six months. And it will be hard to gauge the success of the four-person team in less than a year. If the head of sales is the wrong fit it’s likely the whole team has to be let go - an expensive mistake: 9 months of 3 people’s salaries not including the opportunity cost of having found the right person. In other words an individual contributor hire is a short-term leveraged experiment: only one hire less capital at risk and immediate criteria for evaluation. The Grand Bargain Then why take the risk of hiring an executive to build a team? Three reasons: (i) attract top talent (ii) learn and iterate faster and (iii) grow the business faster. The right high profile hire will be able to recruit top level talent to work for the team. Talent magnets like John Allspaw Adam Nash Kenny van Zant and others build great teams because of their gravity within their respective ecosystems. Like engineering design patterns or marketing best practices management is a learned and perfected skill. Great managers bring with them expertise in team and culture building. Hiring that proficiency instead of re-inventing the wheel saves time. Hiring the right team and enabling that team to be more productive will grow the business faster. Startups are built person by person team by team. Entrusting a worthy manager with that responsibility can drive tremendous leverage in the business. Setting Yourself Up for Success During the beginning of their lives early stage startups develop processes to find the best individual contributors. As startups mature their management teams need to add a new hiring process - one that finds the most capable and trustworthy managers to help grow the business. Every management hiring process is different. Larry and Sergey took Eric to Burning Man to develop their relationship and build trust. Whether action sports alternative music festivals or brainstorming sessions late into the night the most important part of this essential transition for startups is building trust - the basis of all great relationships. I’d love to hear what you think. What are the best ways to build trust with new key hires? Write me on Branch NB: h/t to Josh Reeves who each helped me articulate many of the ideas in this post.

http://tomtunguz.com/byobi/,The Five Letters that Will Change the Data World: BYOBI,The Five Letters that Will Change the Data World: BYOBI BYOBI is an acronym I first heard on a telephone call with a VP of Technology at a large corporation. The word is almost unknown today but I think that it will be one of the largest trends to impact data in the next five years. BYOBI means Bring Your Own Business Intelligence. This VP of Technology was struggling to enable the sales people marketers engineers and others within his business to access the data they needed. The monolithic solution that they had adopted (I can’t remember if it was MicroStrategy or Cognos or BusinessObjects) satisfied the needs of the one department that had catalyzed the purchasing decision many years ago. Several years on his team had become inundated with custom data requests that the tools failed to answer and petitions to purchase new types of software. Unfortunately his data architecture just wouldn’t allow him to respond to those needs. The image below is a simplified schematic of his architecture. This is the way business intelligence software used to work. On the left-hand side engineers transform data from handful of databases kept on premises into an internal data warehouse. The data is then modeled and optimized for answering the questions the business has today. Reports and visualizations are then built for easy access. Inevitably those questions will evolve and new ones will crop up. But at design time those questions are impossible to anticipate. Inevitably the BI tool fails to live up to its potential and teams can’t access the data they need. What’s worse with the explosion of cloud and SaaS software use the data fragmentation problem has exploded. Now company data isn’t stored across a collection of databases within the company’s firewalls but is scattered across thousands of servers all over the world. A diaspora of data. Nevertheless teams within the company still need to access and process and analyze that data irrespective of where it resides. Faced with this problem he decided to dramatically transform his data architecture into BYOBI. The image below illustrates BYOBI architecture. There are four fundamental changes with BYOBI: End users decide which reporting/visualization tools to use. Cloud/SaaS databases are now a key data contributor in addition to the on-premises databases. The different layers of the BI stack have become unbundled and line of business users decide which tool to use instead of IT. Reporting and visualization occurs primarily on raw data not data that has been transformed or optimized a priori. Two key innovations enable this tectonic shift in BI faster databases and better data modeling. Redshift BigQuery and others are taking the data world by storm because their performance benchmarks are staggering over huge data sets. This enables next generation BI tools to provide real-time responsiveness over all the data not just a sample of data as in the past. Data modeling enables data scientists to encode the structure of and relationships among data sets into one compact file and then enable everyone within an organization to ask and answer questions of the data in the correct way without help. Emboldened by newfound confidence of having one consistent source of truth the organization becomes empowered to be more decisive and move faster. With this BYOBI architecture end users decide which tools are the best ones for their use cases. IT’s responsibility becomes data access enablement rather than data request fulfillment. Consequently the entire team is happier and more productive. BYOBI will become the dominant data architecture over the next ten years. As this shift happens the newcomers like Looker which provides novel data modeling and data exploration tools will take significant share from the hegemons of legacy BI. For proof of this coming fragmentation in BI look no further than Tableau’s success. Now a $4B company serving more than 10000 customers Tableau proved end users could influence BI buying decisions. But this is just the beginning of the BYOBI trend. BYOBI will disrupt the $13B business intelligence world creating massive share shift giving rise to new massive companies and enabling teams all over to run their businesses more effectively.

http://tomtunguz.com/end-of-the-year-startup-checklist/,End of the year startup checklist,End of the year startup checklist I call the last working week in December Board Week because it’s packed with board meetings. These board meetings are often the most important of the year. By virtue of their place on the calendar everyone in the room is thinking more strategically less tactically. These meetings set the tone and strategy for the company for the upcoming year. I’ve assembled a checklist below of top 5 things I’ve seen founders do in and around the end of the year that position their companies for success in the next year. An annual post-mortem. What the company accomplished in the last year? What went well? What could the company have done better? This post-mortem is created by the management team with input from the company as a whole. Afterwards the findings are presented to the board and the company in an all hands. Team evaluations. Pick a flavor: peer reviews 360 degree evaluations or management reviews annual reviews are essential to honest cultures in startups. Annual reviews are the best time to evaluate compensation reward the top performers and begin to manage under-performers out of the organization. OKR setting. I’m a avid proponent of the OKR (objective and key result) model where the company leadership sets three measurable quantitative goals for the year. Managers divide those three goals into smaller goals for themselves and so on down the organization. Andy Grove pioneered this at Intel and we used it to great effect at Google. This management technique aligns all the efforts in a company toward the goals. The three things we’re worried about. This is a critical part of the checklist. Board members founders and management team are each worried about issues facing the business. But are they worried about the same issues? Ensuring that each understands the challenges of the other and that the team is prioritizing the same top three concerns grounds communication and focuses the company on the hardest challenges. A financial plan for next year including a headcount plan a sales plan (if applicable) and a forecast for out of cash date and timing of next fundraise. Financial plans are the ambitions of the company codified in numbers. They help with scenario planning goal setting company alignment and team measurement. In addition an options pool plan to ensure the company has enough in its employee stock option pool to continue to hire retain and reward employees. For startups founders and VCs the end of the year is a good time for introspection evaluation and communication. Structuring this tasks has helped our companies become more productive. I hope they help your business too. Email me with other suggestions if you have them and I’ll publish them tomorrow. Published 2012-12-14,Published 2012-12-14
http://tomtunguz.com/startups-increasing-value/,Three Important Trends in the Startup Exit Market,Three Important Trends in the Startup Exit Market Each year the National Venture Capital Association and Thomson Reuters release data characterizing the state of the startup market. I’ve analyzed the 2013 data and there are three important trends I observed. All in all the startup exit market is quite healthy. Startup exit values are increasing more than 7% per year on average. The number of exits is flat-to-down during the ten year period I studied. The public markets have opened to startups again doubling their share of exits. Over the past 10 years startup exit valuations have increased 7% for IPOs and 10% for M&A annually. If the trend continues in 2014 the average material startup acquisition will reach $178M and the average startup IPO will raise $146M. Let me explain the phrase material startup acquisition. The average M&A price I’m quoting isn’t an average across all startups. The data set I’ve used includes only disclosed acquisitions which are acquisitions that represent greater than 10% of the acquirors asset. The data set is skewed this way because publicly traded companies are only required to disclose these acquisitions by the SEC. Below is a chart comparing the total number of exits both IPOs and major acquisitions with the aggregate value of those exits over time. There are fewer exits but they are larger exits. I suspect this is driven primarily by the strength of the IPO market. Public investors have embraced startups and enticed them to go public instead of selling by offering cheap cash at hefty multiples at IPO. Growth stage investors including hedge funds have provided the extra growth capital to finance startups to IPO. This shift to IPOs is plain to see in the data as the chart below shows. During the past two years IPOs have nearly doubled their share of exit dollars to 45% compared to a ten-year average of 28%. As a result the corp dev teams of acquiring companies have to pay larger premiums to startups to allure them and instead of defraying their dollars over a large number of targets these acquirors focus on fewer more strategic bets. There were only 90 major acquisitions in 2013 compared to a ten-year average of 144 a 40% drop and statistically significant at 93% confidence. The data is almost universally positive for startups. Each year startups’ exit price grows 3x faster than inflation. The public markets are more receptive to startup IPOs than at any other time in the past decade and the aggregate value of startup exits is on the rise. The only mildly negative data point is the volume of exits has fallen by 11%. Published 2014-01-20,Published 2014-01-20
http://tomtunguz.com/b2c2b-sales-motions/,The Sales Motions of B2C2B Companies,The Sales Motions of B2C2B Companies After writing about B2C2B companies last week I received a lot of great comments about the differences between the B2C2B models particularly the sales models after a company has acquired the initial Consumers. These are three sales models I’ve observed B2C2B companies use to convert the initial momentum with consumers into dollars. The first sales model is the 2 Phase Sell. LinkedIn and Duolingo employ this. LinkedIn attracts large number of consumers with a place to find jobs and post resumes. Then LinkedIn sells recruiters (and others) access to this data. The B2C2B sales movement involves using the consumer data to create a valuable data asset which is sold to someone else. Duolingo is a free language learning mobile application that asks language learners to translate sentences. These sentences are actually provided to Duolingo by big internet sites who pay Duolingo to translate their pages into other languages through the work of these language learners. The second sales model is the Up Sell. Employed by Expensify Yammer Slack Tableau and many others the Up Sell model attracts employees to use the product because it’s easier to use or improves their productivity in a meaningful way. The social proof of all these employees already using these products informs and fuels a sales process to convert a larger fraction of the company to convert to paid. The third sales model is the cross-sell model which is often used by companies B2D2B companies - those who target developers as their advocates. Companies like Heroku Pantheon Parse and others attract developers to use their products because these platforms eliminate complexity and decrease time to deployment of the product. Developers employ these platforms to create products that often serve the needs of the marketing and product or other internal teams. Developers make the selection and often another team within the company foots the bill. These models are simplifications of the way B2C2B companies generate revenue but I think they’re useful frameworks for planning a startup’s go-to-market. Published 2015-01-12,Published 2015-01-12
http://tomtunguz.com/startup-job-market/,Why 2015 Will be a Great Year for Startups,Why 2015 Will be a Great Year for Startups At the DEMO conference Danielle Morrill the founder and CEO of Mattermark presented an impressive statistic. Seed Series A Series B and Later Stage startups employ 1M people up from 650000 just six months ago according to Mattermark’s data sources. While it’s logical to think that the largest and fastest growing startups might employ the majority of startup employees because they hire at stupendous rates this isn’t the case today. Impressively Pre Series A company employment has boomed increasing by more than 2x in the past six months. These seed-stage companies employ 450k. Mattermark’s employment statistics proxy the startup formation rate. The fertile fund-raising environment and the accelerating rates of new technology adoption have been enticing a substantial number of potential founders to take the leap of faith required to start a business. The doubling of employees in Pre Series A companies presages a boom in Series A financings over in the next 12-18 months and some of those companies founded today will become the behemoths of tomorrow. It also foreshadows a wave of innovation of new and wonderful soon-to-be-released products. Importantly investors have raised nearly twice as much capital in 2014 as in 2013 and their coffers are well stocked to finance new and fast-growing companies. There’s a world of potential right around the corner and it’s plain to see looking at employment and fundraising data. 2015 will be an exciting year for Startupland.

http://tomtunguz.com/choosing-market-segments-on-customer-profitability/,Choosing market segments on customer profitability,Choosing market segments on customer profitability When serving B2B customers your pricing will be dictated by your customers' margins. The more money they make the more they can pay for new technology. Most businesses fund new initiatives including marketing and technology projects from profits. The more profits a company generates the greater their willingness to pay for services and ultimately the larger the market size for a startup. Let’s compare the margins of grocery stores to restaurants to software companies to prove the point. Type Grocery Restaurant Software Name Safeway Chili’s (Brinker) Intuit Market Cap in $B 3.9 2.6 17.6 Revenue in $B 44.1 2.8 4.2 EBITDA in $B 2.7 0.36 1.4 EBITDA per location in $M 1.3 0.35 58 On a percentage basis Intuit is more than three times as profitable as Brinker which is in turn twice as profitable as Safeway. This means Intuit’s budget for new projects and initiatives is much bigger and they should be willing to spend more. Many startups focus on restaurants or grocery stores whose ability to pay for new projects is limited by their relatively small profit pool. The average Safeway store sells about $25M of merchandise annually but generates about $2.7M in profit. These dollars are pulled in many directions: covering potential losses incurred through the year remodeling new online marketing initiatives and ideally profits. Projects like mobile coupon applications or loyalty systems demand dollars also demand dollars from this pool of cash. Due to the relatively small potential revenues from in restaurants startups serving these customer segments have to build very efficient sales teams or online customer acquisition tools to aggregate many of them inexpensively. Restaurants simply can’t afford to pay very much. On the other hand startups targeting software makers have more flexibility in their approach because these companies generate multiples more profit. So these startups can afford higher paid sales teams. Ultimately the startups serving higher profit customers will be more profitable because margins cascade down the value chain.

http://tomtunguz.com/startup-chemistry-the-limiting-reactant/,What my high school chemistry class taught me about startups,What my high school chemistry class taught me about startups Photo: flickr/nemabix I don’t remember much of junior year chemistry class except the lab experiment in which we made fireworks. My lab partner and I doubled and tripled the amounts of strontium potassium calcium and other explosives specified in the instructions. Our firecracker dwarfed our classmates' in size and when we lit them after two unbearable weeks of baking there was no question we misunderstood chemistry. We expected an inferno and were rewarded with a pathetic fizzle and a C-. We made one critical mistake assembling our pyrotechnics: we failed to add enough oxidizer the chemical that creates the oxygen to burn all the explosives. Despite all its potential the firecracker never had a chance. That day I learnt the lesson of the limiting reactant. Startups are a lot like fireworks. To succeed startups need the right chemistry they need to be pointed in the right direction and when they work they’re “on fire.” Startups too have the same problem of limiting reactants or limiting factors. Continuously identifying and counteracting these limiting factors is the key to continued growth. At the outset of a startup engineering throughput can be a limiting factor; the team simply can’t code fast enough. At some point the product launches but no one knows about it. Marketing is the bottleneck. When customers come rushing through the door money in hand sales and customer support might stunt the growth of the company. Other times it’s culture or product market fit or money or competition. But for each startup at every stage there is a limiting factor. A CEO’s most important function as leader of a startup is programmatically searching finding and quashing a startup’s limiting factor. The faster a CEO can do this the faster a startup can grow. Great CEOs anticipate limiting factors and plan ahead timing new hires with key transitions in a company’s life. Like anything worth doing identifying the limiting factor can be challenging. Advisors and board members can help here. So can other entrepreneurs who have suffered the same growing pains. But the most important step is to start looking. So what’s your oxidizer?

http://tomtunguz.com/cash-collections/,A Surprisingly Powerful Mechanism for Growing a SaaS Startup,A Surprisingly Powerful Mechanism for Growing a SaaS Startup One of the single most effective tools SaaS companies can use in order to grow faster isn’t tweaking the product in a particular way or implementing an AB optimization framework or adopting new marketing tactic. Rather it’s financial judo for structuring contracts and cash collection. Cash is the lifeblood of startups. Cash empowers management teams to invest in all kinds of growth mechanisms. So it’s no surprise that maximizing a company’s cash to invest in growth is a good thing. The most effective way I’ve seen of maximizing cash in SaaS and subscription businesses is asking customers to pay at the beginning of their contracts. The chart above contrasts the difference in a hypothetical startup’s cash position over the course of 24 months. This hypothetical startup generates $50K in MRR in month 1 grows by 15% month over month and burns $300k per month. The startup has just raised $6M in Series A financing. It’s no exaggeration to say that in one scenario the startup just scrapes past bankruptcy and in another the company’s coffers overflow with more than $10M in cash in the bank. The magnitude of the change in the company’s health is hard to overstate. The chart shows five different scenarios: 1. Monthly payment - customers pay each month 2. Quarterly payment - customers pay at the end of each quarter 3. Biannual payment - customers pay at the end of each six month period 4. Annual postpay - customers pay at the end of the year 5. Annual prepay - customers pay at the beginning of the year At months 12 and months 24 the startup’s cash position converges on the same point. But in between there are huge differences in cash particularly in the second year. It’s plain to see that annual prepay is the most advantageous position for the company In the annual prepay scenario the company generates negative working capital. Customers are financing the company’s growth by lending the startup money at effectively zero interest. The startup can take that capital and double down on growth if it makes sense for the business a luxury the other parallel financial universes don’t allow. To accomplish this transition from monthly payment for example to annual prepayment requires retraining of the sales team and also perhaps adjusting the sales compensation plan. But it can be done. Wildfire moved from a campaign billing model to an annual prepay model over the course of three months and during that time period moved 80% of revenue to prepayment. Needless to say this small initiative had a disproportionate impact on the financial health and the consequent growth trajectory of the business. Managing cash collections and structuring sales contracts are some of the most impactful initiatives a SaaS company can undertake to maximize their chances of success particularly in the early days of the company’s life.

http://tomtunguz.com/burn-rates-before-ipos/,How Much Cash Does Your Startup Need To Go Public?,How Much Cash Does Your Startup Need To Go Public? How much cash does a tech venture-backed company burn through before IPO? The median 2013 VC-backed tech IPO burned $33M and the average company burned $76M. The chart above shows the net income/burn rate of 2013 tech IPO by years since founding. Four categories of companies jump out in the chart: the profit leaders the middle-of-the-pack the negative hockey stick and the go-for-broke. The profit leaders Veeva(VEEV) and RetailMeNot(SALE) have generated tremendous profits from the outset. The middle-of-the-pack companies including Rally(RALY) and Tableau(DATA) burn no more than $25M annually. Some like Chegg(CHGG) RingCentral(RNG) Marketo(MKTO) and FireEye(FEYE) show reverse hockey-sticks - their burn is increasing at an increasing rate. And the go-for-broke contingent of WorkDay(WDAY) Twitter(TWTR) Gogo(GOGO) Violin(VMEM) and SilverSpring(SSNI) have exceeded the $100M burned in one year mark. In addition to the capital invested to become public a startup must have cash on its balance sheet at IPO. The median company carried $32M and the average company carried $43M on its balance sheet before IPO. In total the median startup raised $65M and the average startup raised $119M before IPO. Practically speaking this likely means four rounds of financing for the IPO-bound startup: something like $5M Series A $10M Series B $25M Series C $25M Series D in the median case. How much runway did the 2013 IPOs possess along the way? On average these now-public names kept 1.1 years of runway in the bank. The chart above shows the smoothed trend across the 2013 IPO vintage. In the early days the numbers are skewed by Zulily the only company in the list to IPO 4 years after founding. Years 4 onward are much more representative when the average company held about 9 to 15 months of cash. At the bottom of the post I’ve included the box plot which shows these trends in more detail. The typical 2013 VC backed tech IPO took seven years to become a publicly traded company. In the years immediately preceding their IPO these companies increased their burn rates substantially from $5 to $10M in the first 3-4 years then to about $25M in the 5th year and $40M in the 6th before declining steadily after IPO. Below I’ve included the box plots that provide more detail about each of these analysis and the histogram of time to IPO. Published 2013-11-18,Published 2013-11-18
http://tomtunguz.com/the-three-phases-of-startup-sales/,The Three Phases of Startup Sales,The Three Phases of Startup Sales Earlier this week I met an experienced head of sales. During our meeting the candidate shared a simple way of thinking about a startup’s sales process that resonated with me. A startup’s sales evolution contains three phases: beta reference customer ROI calculator. Beta: A founder of the startup develops relationships with a handful of customers who will work in tandem with the company to design tune and improve the product. Typically beta customers use the software for free or at heavily discounted rates. These customers benefit by disproportionately influencing product development. Reference Customers: The goal of the beta is to cultivate a handful of reference customers product champions passionate enough about the startup’s product to take calls from potential clients and sing praises about the product. Of course more customers using the product means the startup can continue to improve the product and support it - a benefit for the beta customers. The ROI Calculator: Reference customers' testimonials and case studies should be leveraged to build a larger sales pipeline of potential customers. Some teams stop here but the sales evolution isn’t complete. The last step is to create a return on investment calculator for each customer segment. The ROI calculator estimates the value creation by a startup’s product based on existing customer data. Building this calculator takes time and thought. First many customers must adopt the product use the product and then measure their ROI. But it’s worth the effort. Quantitative estimates of the ROI based on customer data are powerful tools in sales meetings - and particularly if this quantitative argument complements the qualitative social proof provided by reference customers. A startup is a machine designed to forge predictability from chaos. A critical part of that predictability is consistent sales execution and that means evolving the sales process. Like all frameworks this three step process isn't for every business. But it’s a solid high level plan for a sales team. Published 2013-07-17,Published 2013-07-17
http://tomtunguz.com/four-parts-customer-success/,The 4 Teams Within Customer Success Organizations,The 4 Teams Within Customer Success Organizations At Gainsight’s Pulse Conference on Customer Success Mike McKee of Rapid7 spoke about the structure of his customer success team. He projected a slide which I’ve copied in the image above that depicts the way Rapid7 sells a contract deploys its software engenders adoption and expands accounts. It’s the best visualization I’ve seen to describe the sales and customer success process and the inter-team collaboration required to be successful. The four parts of his customer success team are: Sales Engineers/PreSales participate in the sales process with account executives to close the sale. Professional Services provides customers software customization and training. Customer Success Managers nurtures and expands the accounts. The Learning Team provides customers ongoing help with best practices knowledge bases webinars to maximize product use and drive retention. Here’s how the process works. In the sales step an account executive (with a sales development rep/SDR) qualifies a prospect. At or close to the time of sale the account executive partners with member of the sales engineering team and/or the services team to set the right expectations and scope any custom work or training to be done. The sales engineers (also called presales) report to the head of customer success to ensure the company can satisfy the customer’s needs set the customer up for success and mitigate potential churn from overpromising. In the deployment phase the account executive passes the role of customer relationship lead to a member of the customer success organization. The customer success manager works with sales engineering and services to ensure that all the promised work has been completed successfully. In addition the learning team provides knowledge to the customer and the rest of the in-house team. This learning should encourage the customer to use more and more of the feature set or spread the product internally which leads ultimately to account expansion. At this point the customer success manager (CSM) passes the relationship lead back to an account executive which can be the same as in the Sales process. In other cases startups employ dedicated upsell sales teams. In yet other cases startups ask their customer success managers to upsell and add a quota to their CSM’s compensation structure. In this chart above the people in the customer success organization are in blue. Only account executives report to the VP of Sales. Everyone else reports to the SVP of CS. While many SaaS startups employ this type of organizational structure there are a few variations on this model that work very well. When structuring a customer success organization with however many teams and team members there are two critical things to consider. First aligning goals properly (ex. presales reporting to the head of CS) and second building and refining the processes to create seamless handoffs to and from relationship leads at each sale of the process.

http://tomtunguz.com/three-data-points-email-unsubscribes/,Three Data Points on Email List Unsubscribe Patterns,Three Data Points on Email List Unsubscribe Patterns Ultimately the goal of most content marketing campaigns is email address capture. When a reader decides to receive content consistently via email a content marketer knows they’re developing a deeper relationship with that person. Whether the marketers selling software or venture capital retaining an email address is a victory. In the last 18 months this blog has grown its email subscriber list from zero to roughly 8000 subscribers and lost about 1000 meaning the current distribution list is about 7k. Over the weekend I tried to understand the general behavior of unsubscribes. The chart above that over the last 18 months 1064 people have unsubscribed. 24% unsubscribe within the first 30 days 40% within the first 60 days 50% within the first 90 days. I’m not sure why people unsubscribe within the first 90 days but it’s probably worth surveying them to get a better sense of the cause. If you have a point of view please let me know on Twitter. Interestingly there’s no correlation between the day of the week and a number of unsubscribes. Sunday has a much smaller unsubscribe rate but that simply because the data set is much smaller. I don’t write on Sundays. Note the unsubscribe rate here is a campaign rate – meaning the number of people who receive an email from a blog post and choose to unsubscribe. However time of day is a huge factor in unsubscribe behaviors. 66% of unsubscribes occur between 5 and 10PM. Perhaps this is the time we’re all cleaning up our email inboxes and opting out of the content that isn’t useful for us. If nothing else it’s a good reminder that sending emails out in the morning is likely a better time than late in the day. The next step in this analysis is to understand the particular details of blog post content that trigger unsubscribes. If you have thoughts on how to improve this blog and its email newsletter please send me an email at ttunguz@redpoint.com or a tweet at @ttunguz. I’d really appreciate it.

http://tomtunguz.com/customer-value-saas/,The Optimal Average Customer Value for SaaS Startups,The Optimal Average Customer Value for SaaS Startups What should the optimal revenue per customer be for a SaaS company? I could say million dollar contracts typical of enterprise sales provide more long-term stability and total revenue opportunity. On the other hand I might contend larger customer bases paying smaller license fees enable more predictable growth. Which is the correct argument? First lets examine the relationship between average customer value and total revenues to see if smaller customers create a glass ceiling for total revenue. Below are two charts of data from venture-backed SaaS IPOs from 2010 to 2014. The chart on the left shows the average revenue per customer in $k at the time the company filed their S-1. The chart on the right shows the startup’s trailing twelve months’ revenue at the time of their S-1. Click for larger images. Tabular data is here. It’s clear that only a very weak relationship exists between the revenue per customer and total revenues. The small correlation between the two variables proves the point: R^2 is 0.3. In other words entrepreneurs have built very large revenue companies with hundreds of thousands of small customers (Ring Central) a moderate number of medium sized customers (LinkedIn) and a small number of large customers (Veeva). In addition to revenue potential we should consider the impact of average customer value on market capitalization/company value. Below the box plot depicts the distribution of market capitalization broken down by the four quartiles of ACV: $30k $75k $125k and $2M+ in average annual revenue per customer. Across the first three quartiles the median market cap is identical. For these companies the average customer value has very little impact on market cap. The $75k quartile has an upward bias in its distribution compared to the $30k and the $125k quartiles an aberration caused by LinkedIn’s massive success selling $50k average annual licenses to about 4000 customers at the time of the S-1. At first blush the $2M quartile companies seem to garner 3x larger market caps. But the table below shows this is a false conclusion. The $2M quartile companies wait to IPO until they generate 2 to 3x the trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue of the three smaller quartiles. Therefore the difference in market cap multiples across quartiles isn’t substantial. Fourth quartile companies may delay their IPOs to assuage public market investors’ concerns about substantially higher customer concentration risk since the total number of customers is in the low-hundreds. ACV Quartile Mean MC in $M Median MC in $M Average # of Customers Median TTM Revenue in $M <$30k 1763 1510 56166 93 <$75k 6348 1875 2717 88 <$125k 2650 2240 619 61 <$2M 7363 6150 465 150 ACV = Average Customer Value; MC = Market Cap; TTM = Trailing Twelve Months at S-1 filing. For some time I’ve been wondering whether companies selling enteprise software contracts with long sales cycles are less attractive to investors than newer SaaS companies with high-velocity low friction sales models. After all this newer high-velocity model provides much more predictability in sales processes. But the data indicates this isn’t the case. There is no optimal ACV to maximize for market cap or revenues according to this data. Multi-billion dollar SaaS companies can be built serving customers large or small.

http://tomtunguz.com/lindy-effect/,The Disruption Debate is Focused on the Wrong Ideas,The Disruption Debate is Focused on the Wrong Ideas Jill LePore’s New Yorker polemic “The Disruption Machine” attempts to debunk the incredibly popular Innovator’s Dilemma a theory written by HBS professor Clayton Christensen. I’ve been reading the debate around it with some interest. It’s becoming a really interesting conversation but I think the debate is focused on the wrong thing - whether or not these ideas are absolutely correct even axiomatic. They aren’t always true. But that doesn’t mean these concepts are useless. Quite the opposite. This morning Nassim Taleb introduced a second idea into the debate when he wrote to Marc Andreessen: The Lindy Effect is an idea credited to Albert Goldman and says “the future career expectations of a television comedian is proportional to the total amount of his past exposure on the medium.” In his book Antifragile Taleb expands this theory to all of human development. Taleb summarized his view on the theory in an op-ed titled “The Surprising Truth: Technology is Aging in Reverse” published in Wired in 2012. While Taleb’s Wired Op-Ed explains the Lindy Effect it struggles to apply it broadly: But what about a technology that we currently see as inefficient and dying like print newspapers land lines or physical storage for tax receipts? People often counter my argument by presenting such examples. To which I respond: The Lindy Effect is not about every technology but about life expectancy — which is simply a probabilistically derived average. The first challenge with both the Lindy Effect and the Innovator’s Dilemma is neither are predictive as Taleb says above. Neither Taleb nor Christensen maintains a list of the industries or companies likely to be disrupted for example. Both theories are great descriptive tools for describing history but not predicting the future. The second challenge is that both are theories supported by selective examples. Christensen’s examples are in large part undermined by LePore’s research. The Lindy Effect works until it doesn’t. The paper book will continue to flourish until the point the ebook takes over. Same with ceramic plates. Despite those flaws both theories are incredibly useful as frameworks to describe industry dynamics. The entire freemium world is predicated on Christensen’s Innovators Dilemma. Enterprise incumbents constrained by large costs-of-customer-acquisition can’t compete with startups who acquire customers for near-free harkening Christensen’s mini-mill analogy. The Lindy Effect describes the decision-making inertia captured in the aphorism “no one gets fired for buying IBM.” With one phrase a founder can summarize the competitive dynamics within an industry. Disruption will happen in certain sectors and long-incumbent technologies will continue to prevail in others. In some sense these are the main forces in tension in most sectors. While these neither theories apply to every industry nor every set of companies competing with each other they are useful descriptive frameworks for talking about industry dynamics despite their flaws.

http://tomtunguz.com/best-books-saas-sales/,The Best Book on Building a SaaS Sales Team,The Best Book on Building a SaaS Sales Team If you want to understand how to build a great SaaS sales organization you should read Mark Roberge’s The Sales Acceleration Formula. It’s the single best book on the topic. Mark is the Chief Revenue Office at Hubspot a company which has created tremendous success by perfecting the inbound marketing plus sales model. The book is invaluable for every founder CEO and member of the management team because it not only explains how the Hubspot sales team is structured but why the structure came to be. The first employee at Hubspot and tasked with building the sales team Mark developed a structured interview to qualify candidates and correlated the attributes of the best sales candidates. His list surprised me. Preparation Adaptability Domain Experience Intelligence and Passion are the five characteristics of people most likely to succeed in Hubspot’s sales teams. With this knowledge in hand Mark created a quantitative candidate assessment. Based on the linear regression mentioned above the scorecard established hiring consistency and enabled the team to grow predictably. In addition he shares the questions used to evaluate where a candidate falls along the spectrum of these five characteristics. The best part about this section is that it provides a framework for each company to determine the characteristics of the right sales people for their startup. The book reveals how Hubspot’s sales teams brought the same rigorous and quantitative mentality to training sales people managing sales teams developing compensation plans and cultivating sales leaders critical topics that haven’t been discussed openly enough in Startupland. The book addresses the crucial relationship between the sales and marketing teams in SaaS companies and describes the compact the sales and marketing teams at Hubspot reached to enabled each other to support and accelerate each other’s success. The image above describes an insight that formed the basis for the agreement between the sales team and the marketing team. In traditional Outbound Sales leads are first screened for whether they are a good potential fit for a product a task typically completed by the marketing team. The account executives must then determine whether the customer experiences enough pain in the status quo to buy a product. In Inbound Sales the model Hubspot perfected the lead qualification steps are reversed. Through content marketing and education the marketing team creates a funnel of people who suffer from pain and it’s the AEs who must test for product fit. This seemingly small difference is an important one a wave whose ripples cascade through the organization. Because The Sales Acceleration Formula presents a series of logical and straightforward frameworks for constructing all the key disciplines of a startup’s sales team I think it’s the single best book on SaaS sales and every founder should read it.

http://tomtunguz.com/to-sell-is-human/,To Sell is Human,To Sell is Human Daniel Pink former speechwriter for Al Gore has written an unconventional book on sales called To Sell is Human. In this well researched book Pink observes a few surprising evolutions in society and their impact on sales. The hard sell is dead. Enabled by the internet prospective buyers know more about a product than a salesperson. This is true for cars as much as enterprise software. As a result the salesperson no longer leverages an information asymmetry to sell a product. Instead the salesperson must negotiate from the very first word identify a customer problem and solve the problem using a product. Sales is evolving to consulting. The purpose of the pitch is to offer something so compelling that it begins a conversation brings the other person in as a participant and eventually arrives at an outcome that appeals to both of you. According to Wharton research the gun-slinging extroverted salesperson generates only a fraction more revenue than introverts. Champions of the sales floor balance introversion and extroversion. Dubbed ambiverts these salespeople sell 25% more than their colleagues. Everyone in a company must sell: customer support marketing engineering and so on. Atlassian and Zendesk have reached tens to hundreds of millions in revenue without sales teams by empowering customer support teams to solve the problems of an educated customer base. In addition more than 18M Americans work independently a figure that will quadruple in the next ten years. More than most this segment of the workforce must sell effectively to thrive. The term elevator pitch originates from the very first demonstration of an elevator with a safety brake. At the time elevators were hazardous routinely plummeting down shafts when their hoisting ropes fell destroying their payloads. In 1852 Elisha Otis invented a locking system that would catch and secure plunging elevator. Unable to drive much interest in his innovation Otis organized a demonstration in New York City. He stood in the elevator as an assistant severed the hoisting ropes and the safety brake engaged. Otis' innovation paved the way for humans to ride in elevators. Today the Otis company’s products transport 7B people every three days. To Sell is Human is a breezy data supported book that catalogues the changes in sales and shares techniques to improve sales performance. Published 2013-01-04,Published 2013-01-04

Left to its own devices the mob will augment accessorize spam degrade and noisify whatever they have access to until it loses beauty and function and becomes something else. Seth Godin Given the noise and misinformation disseminated on Twitter both during the election and the Sandy disaster I’ve been wondering how Godin’s thoughts apply to new information networks: blogs and feeds. Sifting the feed in search of the truth There is an undeniable early movement toward editorially curated publishing. The Twitter founders have launched the most visible response. Medium a low volume high quality content site is a direct (and opposite) reaction to the high volume noisy Twitter feed. Content proliferation is governed by its half-life In addition to volume reduction Medium axes another dimension: time. Medium places no dates on its posts. Instead Medium uses a voting system to judge and display the quality of a particular post. Blogging has used time as the primary dimension for relevance. The posts a visitor should read are the most recent - so the assumption goes. Feeds are no different. In fact time is the most prevalent quality metric in social products but it shouldn’t be. Content’s half-life is the amount of time required for content to reach half of its lifetime viewership. Relying on time as a proxy for quality accelerates this half-life. The decrease in content’s lifespan makes writing long-form content less worthwhile despite it’s much greater intrinsic value. After all longer content typically has deeper thought at its root. Jump on the bandwagon Medium is not alone. Svbtle the platform I write for is also fostering curated blogging. Arguably Quora led this trend by focusing on questions. Branch is surfacing debates. Marco Arment’s The Magazine is yet another example. If these efforts succeed I think we will build the internet into a much better library - a library not made of scraps of paper but of deep and lasting thought - new Alexandria.

http://tomtunguz.com/javascript/,The Language of the Web,The Language of the Web When I first started programming at a startup I were proud even snobbish about the language we used: Java. I derided JavaScript. I couldn’t have been more wrong. JavaScript has become the dominant language of the web. Every browser PC and mobile understands Javascript. It is a lingua franca among computers. Some hardware even speaks JavaScript. Because of its universality JavaScript’s growth has compounded. The chart above shows the number of code repositories by language on GitHub as analyzed by RedMonk. JavaScript’s share has tripled in 5 years and the number of job requisitions seeking Javascript has grown in parallel. As JavaScript’s popularity has ballooned the technology has matured. Google has accelerated JavaScript performance by 7x in just four years by boosting JavaScript’s virtual machine called V8 to the benefit of 750 million Chrome users. JavaScript long known to be notoriously slow is now faster than Ruby. Additionally new JavaScript frameworks have blossomed enabling the millions of web developers to build full and rich applications quickly. Node.js Angular.js and Meteor enable easy access to databases simpler code maintenance and Model-View-Controller architecture analogous to Spring for Java and Rails for Ruby. JavaScript may not have all the attributes to appeal to every developer. Some may not like its syntax or its speed or its lack of inheritance. But for all of its faults JavaScript has been cemented as the universal programming language of the web. With behemoths like Google startups like Meteor and a litany of open source contributors constantly improving the language and the frameworks to build applications JavaScript will be the platform for web innovation for a long time to come. - Thanks to Geoff Schmidt of Meteor who shared a conversation with me that inspired this post.

http://tomtunguz.com/matching-marketing-tactics-to-the-sales-funnel/,Matching Marketing Tactics to The Sales Funnel,Matching Marketing Tactics to The Sales Funnel Marketing is one of those words without meaning. Or at least a consistent meaning for most people. Recently I met a very bright marketer who broke down a few of the different marketing disciplines and matched them to a freemium sales funnel. His framework is a stroke of genius. I’ve drawn it below. The Four Disciplines of Funnel Marketing The triangle on the left is a standard freemium customer conversion process. First customers become aware of the product then they use the free version of the product then they convert to paid either by themselves or with the aid of an inside sales team and finally they are retained as customers. The rectangle on the right contains the marketing disciplines used to grow and optimize customer acquisition metrics on the right. The list isn’t meant to be comprehensive but does get the gist across. At the top of the funnel PR word of mouth and reach marketing are the tools to drive more awareness. Examples include press mentions viral product features app store promotion and features web page optimization and so on. Second engagement marketing draws freemium users into the products. Engagement marketing includes product tutorials and videos welcome emails and support. Third content marketing closes accounts. Content marketing includes blogging to targeted segments within the user base about useful product tips and social interest posts like customer testimonials. Additionally content marketing inside sales collateral like the scripts used over the phone by the sales and support reps. Data science also fits in this stage when customer segmentation remarketing direct marketing and online acquisition can be most effective. Last lifecycle marketing retains customers by reinforcing the value proposition of the product customers pay for. Customer success teams may call customers with low usage to educate them about the product. Managed support communities build trust into the customer base. And of course email drip campaigns can be quite effective. Mix and Match You’ll notice that the tools used in each of the stages isn’t unique. Email blogging customer interaction might be used in all or just one of the steps. It depends on the product and sales cycle. But the goals of the customer interaction change during each step. It’s the responsibility of the marketing team to first understand the objective at each stage in the sales process and best equip their teams with the tools in product eng and sales with the various marketing disciplines to maximize success. Marketing Clarity This framework really helped me understand the many different disciplines of marketing and when to apply them. I hope it’s helpful for you and your business.

http://tomtunguz.com/tablets-the-third-platform/,Tablets: the third platform,Tablets: the third platform It’s easy to call a tablet a larger a mobile phone. Or a replacement for a notebook or ultrabook. But to dismiss tablets as scaled clones of their bigger and smaller brothers is a mistake. Tablets are the third type of device: the one with the most revenue potential for ecommerce and developers alike. Tablets drive greater volumes of traffic that convert to paid at better rates and drive better qualified and less expensive leads through advertising. Despite the fact that tablet penetration is less than half of smart phone penetration in the US tablets' share of traffic to websites outpaced mobile web in Q1 2012. And with tablet penetration doubling year over year that trend is certain to continue. More impressively overall tablet users' conversion rates are twice as strong as mobile phones and 20% better than PCs. And because the ecosystem is young tablet ads' costs-per-click are low generating much better ROI for advertisers a winning combination for marketers. Reading through EF’s report the ROI metrics are even more favorable for merchants. Longer session times during non-working hours drive this higher propensity to convert. In addition tablet demographics are much more attractive. According to Flurry tablet owners also skew disproportionately older and wealthy with a 18 percentage point skew towards households with income exceeding $50k and a nearly 10 percentage points skew towards 55 and older users compared to smartphones. Not every application category will benefit from pursuing tablets. But the form factor usage patterns customer acquisition economics and demographics will confer tablet-first companies a unique advantage that isn’t yet evident in the market.

http://tomtunguz.com/incrementalism/,Incremental Innovation is Just As Powerful as Disruption,Incremental Innovation is Just As Powerful as Disruption Peter Thiel and Gary Kasparov wrote in the Financial Times about “Our dangerous illusion of tech progress”. The main point of the article is quoted below: [We are living in an era of] cautiousness far too satisfied with incremental improvements. Our ability to do basic things such as protect ourselves from earthquakes and hurricanes to travel and to extend our lifespans is barely increasing [since the 1960s]. The genuine progress in IT from the 1970s up to the 2000s masked the relative stagnation of energy transportation space materials agriculture and medicine. When Plodders Change the World Thiel/Kasparov argue that we are collectively focused on incremental rather than transformative change. Coincidentally the following week week Clay Christensen made a similar argument in the NYTimes These arguments presume that efficiency gains never lead to transformative change. Like Thiel I think Christensen undervalues efficiency innovations. Combining efficiency innovations can lead to enabling innovations that create new industries. For example coupling cheap computing with virtualization enabled cloud computing - a potentially $100B industry. Shannon a research at Bell Labs invented digital telephony an incremental bandwidth usage improvement over analog transmission which ultimately enabled the Internet. The text message (SMS) a trivial innovation is the banking mechanism over which 33% of Kenyan GDP flows. Blue ocean opportunities like asteroid mining and commercial space travel will attract a certain type of personality. And efficiency innovations will attract another. There is room and a need for both. Though they pursue innovation in different ways directly and indirectly these entrepreneurs do change the world similarly. Banging on the wrong pots and pans While it may be true that an increasing number of people are focused on efficiency innovation as the field of entrepreneurship grows the claim that we’re not pursuing significant problems is inaccurate. Below is a list of advances made in various fields from a few Google queries. Significant innovation is occurring in fields like healthcare transportation and agriculture. Health 1. The average US lifespan has increased by 9 years (13%) since 1960. 2. The FDA just approved the first digital pill that monitors patients response treatments. 3. The cost of sequencing a genome has fallen by more than 4 orders of magnitude - much much faster than Moore’s law. Transportation 1. Google thinks it is five years away from productionizing self-driving cars. 2. The number of passenger miles flown in the US has increased by 18x since 1960 and jets have never been safer to fly. 3. Fatalities on US roads per capita has fallen by 80% since 1960. Agriculture 1. Agricultural yields in the US have increased 250% for corn 200% for wheat and soybeans and 75%+ for barley and oats. Right cause questionable war-cry There’s no doubt we could always be aiming higher funding research and new ideas to a greater extent relaxing H1B visa restrictions or reducing barriers to entry for new companies. To his great credit Thiel is a contributor to this effort. He has many initiatives to finance progress: the Thiel fellows programs his numerous investment vehicles and working with his colleagues from PayPal who have built SpaceX Telsa Yammer LinkedIn and other disruptive companies. But to question the progress and changes we’ve seen in the past 50 years and the innovations that we’re on the cusp of commercializing is a misleading way to build a groundswell. Even if the cause is laudable. Published 2013-02-13,Published 2013-02-13
http://tomtunguz.com/the-first-saas-company/,A SaaS History Lesson – The First SaaS Company's Exceptional Journey,A SaaS History Lesson – The First SaaS Company's Exceptional Journey The first SaaS startup started as a packaged software company. After selling floppy disks and CD-ROMs of expense software in computer software stores the company changed models for the first time and sold software licenses directly to enterprises. The company went public on this model in 1998. But soon after the crash of 2001 the startup’s market cap totaled only $8M. So the business evolved again and became a pure SaaS business selling software accessible to anyone with a browser. Thirteen years later the company generated more than $600M in annual revenue in 2014 and sold to SAP for $8.3B in the largest ever SaaS acquisition and it is one of the very few SaaS companies ever to achieve both positive revenue and cash flow break-even. That company is Concur the travel and expense business. SaaS history isn’t very long. But Concur’s story stands out as a seminal journey for a few reasons. First the company’s founders persisted and persisted and ultimately built a category defining company. Second Concur’s history provides a mechanism to contrast the license software and a SaaS business models. The chart above plots Concur’s revenues through its three eras starting in 1995 through 2014. Each era (CD License Cloud) is shaded. The company generated about $2M in revenue as it switched to its licensed software business. Then Concur quickly grew to about $41M over the next five years before the transition to selling SaaS in 2001. Concur completed the full transition to cloud by 2005. Then the company’s revenue skyrocketed to more than $700M in 2014. Concur’s gross margins were highest late in its Cloud era. In the CD days the costs of writing the software on disk packaging shipping stocking the boxes and the commission paid to the retail store depressed gross margins to below 40%. The license model increased gross margins to better than 60%. Professional services (training and customization) represented the majority of cost of goods sold (COGS) for the business during the License Era. In the Cloud Era the economies of scale powered the company to achieve all time gross margin highs in 2010 of about 72%. Let’s shift to profitability (net income). Concur’s transition to SaaS transformed the business from one with a less than -100% net income as percent of revenue to a net income positive business. At roughly the same time the business became cash flow break-even (CFBE). Achieving both CFBE and positive net income is no mean feat and it’s a testament to the strength of the company’s business model and the discipline of the management team. I spoke to Steve Singh the founder and CEO of Concur about the company’s history and he told me “We decided it was not good enough to to be cash flow positive. We also wanted to be profitable. It forces a great discipline on the business…Operating at a profit brings to light all the things that we are not great at. If we can focus on our weaknesses alongside the things we are great at we will become impossible to beat.” Very few companies survive one major business model evolution. Concur is exceptional for thriving after two of them recording exceptional financial performance and for being a founder-led business from the beginning. Published 2015-04-28,Published 2015-04-28
http://tomtunguz.com/sales-discounts-cash-burn/,The Risk Sales Discounts Impose to Startup Burn Rates,The Risk Sales Discounts Impose to Startup Burn Rates Creating a sense of urgency is one of the most powerful sales tools available to SaaS companies. There are many different ways of accomplishing this but one of the most common ways is to offer discounts that expire. Discounts are powerful incentives to increase sales. But they have to be crafted correctly or they can have dramatic impact on a startup’s cash position. This is why sales incentives should be designed hand-in-hand with the company’s finance team. Imagine a hypothetical 20 person software company. Suppose this month is seasonally slow month and the executive team decides to implement a 25% discount to accelerate sales. There are many ways of offering this discount to customers. Above I have modeled three: a 25% reduction billed monthly a 25% reduction billed upfront and the first three months of the subscription are free. Each of these options costs customers the same total amount over the course of 12 months. But the cash position of the business is quite different for each because there is a difference in the timing of when commissions are paid (cash out) and when customers pay (cash in) which can cause a cash squeeze. A few more relevant details behind a model. The company has five salespeople and five sales development reps. The account executives have a quota of $720000 per year and the company charges its customers $25000 per year. the account executives make $120k in on target earnings split 50 ⁄50 between salary and commission. And the sales development reps earn $50k annually. I’m not including benefits in these calculations. In the case of the 25% off billed monthly the company pays salary and commission in month one to the sales team of about $71k. Over the next 12 months the customer pays a discounted monthly fee the company suffers a unit cash shortage through month five. In the case of the three free months then annual prepay the company suffers a cash shortage through the first quarter of the contract and then receives a lump sum payment of $180000 a month 4. In the last case of a 25% discount with annual prepay the company never suffers a cash shortfall. This is a really simple model intended to show the importance of understanding the timing of cash inflows from customers and cash outflows from sales commissions. In steady-state most businesses maintain a stable balance between these two. But when designing sales incentives in order to spur a slow month it can be easy to forget the cash impact to the business of a particular promotion. Published 2015-05-26,Published 2015-05-26
http://tomtunguz.com/the-bike-rack-effect/,Startup Best Practices 6 - Avoiding the Bike Rack Effect,Startup Best Practices 6 - Avoiding the Bike Rack Effect Imagine a city council meeting with three agenda items: a $100M power plant zoning approval a request to build a $10000 bike rack for city sidewalks and and a $100 proposal to buy refreshments for the annual picnic. The power plant discussion takes all of 3 minutes to reach approval as does the refreshment budget. But the $1000 bike rack debate drags on for hours as council members debate the right materials the best color scheme and the right way to announce the project. Cyril Northcote Parkinson a British historian and operations researcher penned this extreme example of decision-making in meetings in his book Parkinson’s Law. Paraphrasing the Wikipedia entry the powerplant is so expensive the sums of money are hard to frame. Electricity generation is also quite complicated. As a result council members lazily skip over the seemingly impenetrable problem in the meeting deferring to the team managing the project. The bike rack on the other hand is tangible. Each member has used a bike rack and an opinion on which type is the best. In addition the money at stake rests within a typical person’s spending. So everyone involved wants to inject their point of view and derive satisfaction from having added value. The discussion drags on and the majority of the meeting time is spent on a relatively trivial topic. It’s easy to be swept up in the trivial and fun stuff starving the big issues for the time and consideration they merit. Though the differences between projects never reach the extremes described in Parkinson’s hypothetical council meeting the same behavior occurs. Sometimes I find myself in a conversation I’ve started and realize I’m focused on the bike rack not the powerplant and wonder how I got there. I’ve seen a few different ways of trying to prevent this corollary to Parkinson’s Law from taking effect including allocating differing time slots to particular agenda items placing a stopwatch or clock at the center of a conference room or providing a quick reminder at the start of a meeting about the relative importance of topics. Ultimately I think awareness and mindfulness during the meeting is the best antidote; and a culture that welcomes a Parkinson’s Law critique. Have you seen the bike effect at your company? How do you combat it? Published 2014-03-24,Published 2014-03-24
http://tomtunguz.com/four-types-customer-support-organizations/,The 4 Types of Customer Success Organizations,The 4 Types of Customer Success Organizations Each quarter Zendesk releases a Customer Satisfaction Benchmark to help companies build more effective customer support teams. The Q4 2014 differs from the previous in an important way. Instead of comparing companies in the same industry for example Education Zendesk clustered companies with similar customer support characteristics including ticket volumes product support complexity and a few others which revealed some important conclusions. Zendesk found four clusters of support organizations listed below in increasing order of sophistication: Late Bloomers - companies of all shapes and sizes whose customer support efforts need improvement. Relationship Builders - small teams which respond slowly but with personalized and detailed feedback. Relationship builders sustain high customer satisfaction scores because of the personalization. Masters of Complexity - large teams receiving detailed requests with lots of back and forth between the customer and the team. These companies maintain higher customer satisfaction by maintaining a higher ratio of customer service reps to tickets so each person can take their time and answer a question fully. Captains of Scale - large teams facing high support volumes who use every tool at their disposal and do it well so they maintain high customer satisfaction scores despite the deluge. The main differentiating factors across these clusters are email volumes inquiry complexity and response time. The best teams the Captains of Scale employ four tools to manage the support volumes and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction: Help Center - enables users to help themselves which decreases support volumes and increases customer satisfaction because users answer their question immediately. Business Rule Automation - filters support email based on customer value type of question or some other heuristic. Specialists respond to these questions faster increasing customer satisfaction. This is particularly useful with very large support voluems. Ticket to Agent Ratio - more agents responding means faster response times less churn happier customers. Of course a startup must balance this ratio with the increased costs. 24x7 Support - very few companies provide 24x7 support because it can be very expensive. But 24x7 support reduces wait times because agents are constantly responding. Zendesk’s reports are great tools better understand the relative performance of your startup’s support operations. Using the right tools and techniques you can maximize your customer happiness and increase the likelihood customers refer other customers helping your startup grow faster and more efficiently.

http://tomtunguz.com/2013-ipo-characteristics/,The Single Biggest Determinant of Startup Valuations at IPO,The Single Biggest Determinant of Startup Valuations at IPO In 2013 growth trumps all other considerations. For the average 2013 venture backed tech IPO half of the startup’s enterprise value is explained by its growth rate while none of it is explained by profitability. The market has spoken and startups have responded. Of the 25 IPOs I surveyed both pending and completed only 20% are profitable. On average these startups operate at about -20% net income margins but are growing at 162% annually. The startup financing market is (mostly) a trickle down market. The public markets benchmark the value of different companies growth trajectories and financial characteristics daily. These data are used to price comparable companies in the private markets particularly by growth investors but increasingly by earlier investors. SaaS startups prove the point. Their older brothers have become darlings in the public markets and as a result early stage SaaS valuations have appreciated quite rapidly in the venture and growth stage markets. The opposite is true for gaming startups caused by Zynga’s tumultuous ride on the Nasdaq. Let’s go to the data to prove the point. Below is a chart with 21 different 2013 IPOs. The y-axis shows 2012 revenue growth and the x-axis shows the enterprise value of the business (log10). Each company is represented by a dot and the ticker is labeled. It’s easy to draw a straight line up and to the right. The correlation between these two is 0.51 quite strong. This means growth is the single most important correlating factor when predicting enterprise value. Next is the same chart for net income and enterprise value. It’s a mess compared to the one above. There is no relationship between profitability and the startup’s enterprise value. The correlation between net income and enterprise value is zero. Notice Control4 and Violin memory have the same market cap but one is break-even and the other lost $120M on revenues of $90M. That means the company’s gross burn is $210M annually! I suspect tech IPOs are one of the very few high growth investments afforded to investors. Because there aren’t many alternatives for these investment dollars that can generate meaningful returns startups who are going public command pricing premiums even without the discipline of profitable growth. Today that trend is trickling down to the early stage venture market and reinforced what has always been true in early stage startup investing: growth is king.

http://tomtunguz.com/startupland-zendesk/,A Unique Chronicle Of A Billion Dollar Company,A Unique Chronicle Of A Billion Dollar Company At the beginning a startup is only people a group of friends who share a passion to change the world in some way. There is no product no brand no management team no PR no swag no internal processes no hierarchy. Over time by virtue of all the effort of the people within the company startups evolve into semi-autonomous machines; machines that acquire and serve customers with a great product in exchange for revenue. Once the machine is operational most of the conversations about the company shift from the people building the business to the machine they have assembled. While understanding the machine is important the personal stories of the individuals architecting and operating the machines fascinate me much more. Unlike most startup histories which focus on the machine In Startupland Mikkel Svane the founder and CEO of Zendesk chronicles the creation of one of the most efficient business machines ever by concentrating on the human stories. Throughout the book Mikkel shares his perspectives on the softer parts of business - not how to build a great customer acquisition engine - but how his team’s perspective on the company changed with time: Our goal was to build not a big company but a great product…But soon the honeymoon ends. The idea becomes a reality and you discover that even though you never really wanted to build a company all of a sudden you are doing just that. And the reality is that building a company is hard—it’s no longer about just pursuing an idea. The idea has taken off and it becomes all about executing and scaling…Before you know it you have all these real customers who need real attention and you need to start building the beginnings of an organization. Startupland is one of the most genuine and candid articulations of the human side of startups. He writes about the dynamics of the founding team (Alexander and Morten) through the challenge of financing the business in its early days (who to trust?) the strain of relocating the company not once but twice (with families in tow) and his personal trials as he evolves into the CEO of a publicly traded company (particularly when firing people). Every founder should read it. Published 2014-11-14,Published 2014-11-14
http://tomtunguz.com/voice-interface-of-the-future/,The Fastest User Interface,The Fastest User Interface In “Time to Hang Up on Voice” Sam Lessin argues voice isn’t the interface of the future for three reasons. First voice is hard to use in public places because background noise complicates interpretation and because many people are in earshot voice isn’t private. Second speaking to computers is less efficient than typing or using gestures. Third keyboards are better tools for editing text than voice. But I think he’s wrong if for only one reason: speed. Let’s compare two people at the cutting edge of communication. Barbara Blackburn holds the world record for typing at 212 words per minute on a Dvorak keyboard a layout optimized for efficiency. Steve Woodmore holds the world record for speaking at 637 words per minute. At the limit of human performance the spoken word is three times faster than the typed word. For those not competing in Guinness World Record challenges the median typing speed is about 30-40 words per minute and the median speaking speed is again three times that about 120 words per minute. The ratio is relatively constant. This is the reason we often call each other rather than writing a long response to an email. It’s faster. I’ve tried everything to process emails faster including learning Dvorak. But dictation is by far the fastest. In addition I’ve found spoken emails sound are warmer more human more conversational. Speed also drives the success of Siri and Google’s Voice search which I’m told receive billions of queries per day. It’s just faster to say “weather San Francisco” or “navigate to Sightglass” than to hammer out the the words on the tiny slab of white chiclets. As for using voice in public places we already do that all the time. We call people. Noise cancellation technology combined with social awareness and modesty mitigates the audio fidelity and privacy questions. But editing text by voice can be a challenge. I suspect for 140 character texts deleting is faster than editing. And for longer content I combine voice with keyboard and mouse. Best of both worlds. is optimal and faster than keyboard alone. Voice won’t ever become the only interface. I can’t imagine teens texting by voice in schools for example. It may never become the dominant interface. But as voice recognition accuracy improves; as ambient computers akin to the visions painted in Her and Star Trek whose forbears are already here in the form of MotoX Moto Hint and Google Glass become reality; and as users seek greater and greater efficiency in their communication voice will become an increasingly important interface because of its speed.

http://tomtunguz.com/gigabytes-under-management/,Gigabytes under management,Gigabytes under management When I walk into a bank today I might deposit my cash in exchange for some interest rate. The interest rate is my cut of the profits the bank made on my deposit through their trading and lending activities. The more assets under management the more money a bank can make on its own account. Like banks web companies are in the business of maximizing gigabytes of user data under management. When I use Google products like Gmail Google Search Android and Android applications Google Chrome for browsing Google Plus for social networking Google TV YouTube clicking on Google Ads I’m “depositing” my data with Google. Google uses this panoply of data across their user base to generate tens of billions in revenue from advertising at 30% EBITDA margins. The profits of the advertising business subsidize all of their free products I mentioned above. Said in the reverse all these free products attract users to deposit data with Google. Data is the linchpin of Google’s revenue models. And because the marginal cost of storing user data is negligible and the marginal benefit of additional data is substantial (more data means better ad targeting which means more profit) Google benefits from tremendous economies of scale. The same is true for Facebook Yahoo Aol Demand Media WebMD and every other consumer service. But the concept of maximizing gigabytes under management doesn’t stop at advertising businesses. In fact it’s fundamental to many categories of internet companies. Freemium companies like Expensify and Zendesk subsidize product use in exchange for user data to inform inside sales teams' funnels. Social networks like LinkedIn and PatientsLikeMe operate social networks in exchange for user data selling subscriptions for data access. Amazon operates Prime (a “free” shipping service and a “free” video-on-demand service) at what must be negative operating margin to drive more browsing for more data to improve targeting and increase sales. The most successful companies on the internet create a reinforcing cycle in with this idea: they use free products to acquire more gigabytes under management to drive more profits which are used to build better free products.

http://tomtunguz.com/dvorak/,The Great Keyboard Layout Debate,The Great Keyboard Layout Debate I’ve been following Casey Johnston’s journey on Ars Technica to switch keyboard layouts from the ubiquitous Qwerty layout to the Dvorak layout with great interest and empathy. (part 1 and part2). About six years ago I went through the same process to learn Dvorak. It took me five tries to succeed. Judging by the volume and passion of the comments in that series keyboard layouts are a topic many people are pretty passionate about. I suspect it’s because we’re all trying to eke out a little more each day from ourselves. Like many others I type volumes on my laptop: emails and blog posts tweets and instant messenger. Frequently though the tendinitis I suffered from as a rower in college flares up. So I dictate emails often and use text expansion software which reduces recurring phrases to just three key strokes. For example when I type ttt into this window TextExpander converts it to “Thanks for making the time to meet me.” Despite those countermeasures I’ve still had problems. I knew that there was no conclusive research proving the Dvorak layout is faster. But organizing the most frequently used keys on the home row seemed logical to me because the distance each finger moves would be dramatically lessened and I hoped it might relieve some of the pain. I tried five times over six months to make the switch. Reading through Casey’s journeys reminds me of that transition time. Instant messages were the most frustrating part because I would chat with my wife or my friends and their expectation of response times were much faster than my typing. After about a month of 10-30 minute training sessions each morning though I was off and running. Today I’m probably about the same speed as I was in my QWERTY days but typing speed isn’t a competitive advantage in venture capital so I think it’s fine. About a year later I changed the layout on my mobile phone to Dvorak too purely for consistency. For a while it wasn’t hard to keep the layouts separate in my head. But now Qwerty seems foreign. Keyboard layouts don’t come up in conversation very frequently but when they do I brace myself for a good laugh at my expense. Just saying the word Dvorak screams nerd. Luckily it’s a rare topic of conversation. The only times people uncover my secret are when they glimpse the keyboard on my mobile phone or try to use my laptop and the letters on the screen don’t correspond to those on the keyboard. It’s not for everybody but I’m glad I made the switch. But I hope my switch will soon be in vain and in the very near future keyboards disappear only to be replaced by something much more elegant so none of us are inclined to debate which layout is better.

http://tomtunguz.com/blogging-tools/,The Machinery of Blogging,The Machinery of Blogging I’ve been getting a few questions about the tools I use to publish this blog so I figured I’d write about it and reveal the machinery behind the curtain. I use four main tools Jekyll Github Mou and RStudio. Jekyll is the blogging engine; Github is the hosting provider; Mou is the app I use to write these posts; and RStudio is the place I analyze data and make charts. The most important tool is the engine. I chose Jekyll because Jekyll sites load faster than most other blogging platforms. Jekyll is an open source project created by two engineers at Github. At Google I saw the importance of page load times on user experience and that has always stuck with me. Also I wanted the ability to instrument my blog to run experiments and understand the impact on reading habits which meant hosting my own blog rather than using a platform. Most blogging platforms (Wordpress Tumblr etc) store user posts in a database. When a blog post page is requested by a blog visitor Wordpress pings the database for the post content injects the content into the blog template and sends it to the browser. Said another way content compilation occurs at the time of request. Jekyll works very differently. A static-site generators (SSG) Jekyll eliminates the database by compiling posts as I write them instead of when the user asks for them. When a visitor arrives the content has been prepared already. Because the website is pre-compiled users load pages faster. SSGs have other benefits too. Security is much stronger and hosting is cheaper. I host on Github Pages which is about $7 per month. But the speed comes with a handful usability costs. There is no website to create a new post. Instead I write the posts in a text-editor on my laptop. I use Mou an open-source markdown editor that has a preview pane so I can see what the final post will look like as I type it. Mou also has a spell-checking feature. I wish Mou or other tools also checked grammar the way Microsoft Word has for more than a decade. Also there is no save or publish button with Jekyll. To publish new posts and fix errors in previous ones I use git a command line tool. Because the site must compile after each change I wait about 5 minutes before a new post goes live. Though Github seems to have accelerated this process quite a bit recently. There is one project that provides a UI on Jekyll/Github sites called Prose.io. But I’ve found it’s very buggy. Because of these challenges I don’t recommend Jekyll for everybody. Ghost is likely a much better alternative for most companies who need to control their own design. Svbtle and Medium are also wonderful options for individuals. An important difference between the two: Svbtle allows authors to use an existing domain name and Medium provides one for you. To analyze data and create charts I use a code editor for R called RStudio and two terrific libraries from Hadley Wickham dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for visualization. Plot.ly is a wonderful alternative particularly when I want to build interactive charts. For a while I used Excel/Numbers but the programming nature of R makes it much easier to re-run previous analyses with new data. Also R has a huge collection of different tools for creating box plots and maps and also doing more sophisticated types of analysis like linear modeling and moving averages. I designed the site using Bootstrap.js Twitter’s excellent library for responsive layouts. Typekit provides two fonts P22-Underground for the titles and Minion-Pro for paragraph text. The blog is instrumented with Google Analytics with custom events. I’ve instrumented all the sharing actions (Twitter FB HackerNews etc.) the subscription actions (email + rss) and also the Read this Next feature at the bottom of the page. I’m missing a tool for automatically resizing images to the right dpi and width to maximize page load times. Today I do this by hand with Apple’s Preview if the file size is greater than 200 kb. That’s my blogging machinery. If you have suggestions on a better toolkit or thoughts on this one I’d love to hear them. Send me a tweet. Published 2014-03-20,Published 2014-03-20
http://tomtunguz.com/webex-history/,How Great Unit Economics Enables Startups to Weather the Storm - The Story of WebEx,How Great Unit Economics Enables Startups to Weather the Storm - The Story of WebEx In the late 90s one company changed its name five times before they settled on one which today is a well-known brand. The business started as Silver Computing in 1995 then Stellar Computing in June 1997. Six months later the company would rebrand as next ActiveTouch Systems then six months later to ActiveTouch Inc. and finally six months before IPO to WebEx. WebEx went public in June 2000 with $8.3M in revenue over the previous twelve months. After three relatively slow years growing from $1M to $3M the company’s revenue rocketed 7x then 3x and the close to 2x as the chart above shows. And churn was pretty impressive too. WebEx retained 95% of their customers the year they went public. To achieve that phenomenal growth in 2000 the company ramped their sales and marketing investment from $2M to $9.3M to $50M from 1998 to 2000 representing an astounding 300%+ of revenue. After the dot-com crash the company stabilized their investment in sales and marketing constant at $50M which was roughly 40% of revenues. The executive team sustained that level for eight years until their acquisition by Cisco for $3.2B. WebEx benefitted from an extremely efficient sales model. Setting aside 1999 the company enjoyed sales efficiency of greater than 1 until the business attained $150M+ in revenue. As we’ve seen in the other S-1 analyses most companies never observe sales efficiencies better than about 1.1 for the two years before IPO and subsequently which makes WebEx’s model that much more impressive at scale. The combination of the company’s revenue retention and sales efficicency suggest the massive investments in sales and marketing were substantiated by strong unit economics. This dramatic sales and marketing investment generated an $80M loss in 2000 but two years later astoundingly the company generated $16.4M in profit or about 12% of revenues. This ability to transform from burning huge amounts of cash to attaining both cash flow break-even and profitability all the while growing more than 30% per year is due in large part to the unit economics of the business. From then on the company remained profitable. At the company’s spending peak the company burned $3.75M per month. In total the company consumed about $65M to reach cash flow break-even and profitability having raised about $110M before a $40M IPO. WebEx’s story is an important one particularly today given the state of the fundraising markets for startups. Despite the collapse of the stock market the disappearance of many startups/customers and the tremendous burn rate of the business WebEx grew steadily and consistently. The history of WebEx exemplifies the importance of operating a business with sound principles and decision-making. Great customer retention and superb sales efficiency are a winning combination. If a business has great economics no matter the disasters and turmoil in the external environment the company can be worth billions and grow throughout a down-cycle.

http://tomtunguz.com/bottoms-up-sales-cycles/,The Beauty of Bottoms Up SaaS Businesses,The Beauty of Bottoms Up SaaS Businesses One smart SaaS entrepreneur told me last week he prefers bottoms up businesses to top-down companies because bottoms up sales and marketing efforts enable startups to pursue hundreds of paths into a company. Unlike top down sales processes which offer a startup one shot at closing an account (a meeting with a CEO or VP) for bottoms up products each employee is a credit-card-carrying-decision-maker. As the number of total potential buyers expands so does the universe of sales processes. And because each sales process is targeted to an individual the sales cycles are much shorter. Combined these two attributes of bottoms-up sales models permit startups to AB test and iterate their marketing and sales tactics much more quickly. Each experiment in marketing collateral or sales pitch reaches statistical significance in weeks not months or years. Bottoms up businesses also have another beautiful trait - they lead with their product. After marketing educates and interests potential users the product and engineering team’s effort must shine during trial to entice a user to convert to paid. A startup can measure their effectiveness through the signup to paid flow and again experiment their way to success. Last in bottoms up sales processes customer success teams become critical contributors to the product roadmap. Daily customer success teams hear and understand the challenges users face and report them to the product team. In a top down model the sales team often is responsible for relaying this feedback which sometimes leads to feature building to satisfy the needs of one particular client often a member of the leadership team not the true end user. Through experimentation and analysis bottoms up SaaS companies can quickly spin a customer acquisition flywheel that can be used to generate enough business to grow a business very quickly.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-missing-step-in-saas-onboarding/,What SaaS Startups Miss in User Onboarding,What SaaS Startups Miss in User Onboarding Over dinner a veteran product manager argued most SaaS products’ onboarding practices miss a crucial step: create value for the user in the first session. After that conversation I signed up for many brand-name SaaS products pretending it was for the first time and I couldn’t help but agree with him. Most SaaS products guide a user through three steps. First collect the requisite data to create an account like email and password. Second configure integrations with related services customize the platform and/or invite other key users. Third educate users about the product by indicating the most important menus and actions. The third step has recently become synonymous with onboarding and many product teams have invested there. Clement Vouillon details the five types of on-boarding strategies with examples in his post on onboarding: passive tour the active tour video on boarding slide on boarding and step-by-step walkthrough with fake data. While this may be the state-of-the-art for most SaaS startups it’s not enough to optimize the funnel. As the seasoned product manager articulated the onboarding process must create some value for the user during that sign-up session in order to keep the user coming back. All the products I tried either stepped me through an explanation of the product or simply left me at the home screen after registration. I felt like an new employee during my first day at work. I had signed my W-2 tax form received an email account been shown the route between my office and the lunchroom and then told to get to work. I’m certain there are best-in-class user onboarding flows out there and if you know of one please email me because I’d like to update this post and feature that workflow. Although I don’t have data to support the argument I believe that achieving that magical moment - solving a part of the user’s within the first session - is essential to great user onboarding.

http://tomtunguz.com/counterintuitive-sales-funnel-efficiency/,Sales Funnel Optimization for SaaS Startups,Sales Funnel Optimization for SaaS Startups There’s a magical property to the classic sales funnel SaaS startups use to evaluate the effectiveness of their go-to-market organizations: an increase in effectiveness at any stage of a sales funnel cascades through to the end funnel. But improvements to the early parts of the funnel are more important than those later in the funnel because they meaningfully improve key SaaS metrics like cost-of-customer acquisition and pay-back period. Most startups employ a four stage funnel: prospect lead opportunity customer. Typically a prospect is an email of a potential customer. A Sales Development Rep (SDR) qualifies the prospect to a lead. The lead is then passed to an Account Executive (AE) who qualifies it further into an opportunity and works to close the deal yielding a customer. The yield from one part of the funnel varies quite a bit depending on the startup’s sector how the business acquires leads the competitive dynamics in the sector and the qualification regimen of the company. Let’s compare three different funnels each starting with 1000 leads and yielding 125 customers. Funnel 1 pushes 50% of leads through each step. In Funnel 2 SDRs filter 70% of prospects up-front. In Funnel 3 Account Executives whittle down the high volume of SDR-qualified leads late in the process. Funnel Prospect Lead Opportunity Customer 1 1000 500 250 125 2 1000 300 150 125 3 1000 750 500 125 For each funnel we’ll improve yield at a different step. In Funnel 1 the prospect-to-lead ratio increases by 10%. Same for Funnel 2’s Lead-to-Opportunity ratio and Funnel 3s Opportunity to Customer Ratio. Funnel Prospect Lead Opportunity Customer 1 1000 550 275 137.5 2 1000 300 165 137.5 3 1000 750 500 137.5 No matter where the incremental 10% improvement occurred in the funnel the business benefits from a 10% growth in customers. This conclusion can be counterintuitive at first but it works because of the commutative property of multiplication. For startups this hypothetical implies that any efficiency or yield improvement in the sales funnel is equally as valuable as another of the same magnitude. But consider the question of time efficiency for a startup. Let’s assume an SDR requires 5 minutes to evaluate a prospect an AE needs 30 minutes to qualify a lead to an opportunity and the AE invests 4 hours to convert an opportunity to a customer. The table below shows the total hours required by each step. Funnel Lead Opportunity Customer Total SC CAC ($) 1 83 275 825 1183 403 2 83 150 450 683 229 3 83 375 1125 1583 543 The third funnel is 2x more expensive in time as the second requiring 1583 hours to produce 137.5 customers compared to 683 hours. The sales-contribution to the cost-of-customer-acquisition which is abbreviated SC CAC in the table above increases from $228 to $543 for Funnels 3 compared to 2. In other words this time efficiency doubles how much money the sales team invests to acquire a customer. Keeping the SC CAC low will increase payback periods sales efficiency and many other go-to-market metrics enabling your startup to grow faster with less capital required. This is why investing in improvements at the top of the sales funnel particularly in early prospect and lead qualification are so valuable: they save the time and energy of a startup’s go to market teams and can meaningfully improve unit economics.

http://tomtunguz.com/netsuite-s-1/,Benchmarking Netsuite's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking Netsuite's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up Founded in 1998 Netsuite is worth about $7.7B making it the sixth largest SaaS compay behind Salesforce LinkedIn Workday ServiceNow and Splunk. Netsuite began developing ERP (enterprise resource planning) tools to help companies manage their finances expenses and supply chain. Over time Netsuite has added a few more product lines including ECommerce platform CRM business intelligence and a professional services management product. In the last ten years Netsuite has grown revenue from $18M to $556M. As the company disclosed in their last annual report Larry Ellison the CEO of Oracle owns 47.4% of Netsuite common stock implying the company is strategically important to Oracle. Over the past decade Netsuite has grown 37% per year starting at about 51% in 2005 and in recent years consistently sustaining 25% annual growth. In 2006 according to the company’s S-1 the business shifted from longer term contracts to one year contracts. Most companies as they scale tend to move in the other direction. Netsuite’s revenue per customer averaged $19k in 2008 and $23k in 2009 the last years for which the company provided customer counts. Most ERP systems require substantial configuration. After all the internal systems of each company vary. Despite customization requirements from customers Netsuite has maintained professional services revenue at 20% over the life of the company which is among the highest in the industry but by no means worrisome. Netsuite operates its professional services division at 0% gross margin - basically at cost - which is in the middle of the pack. 90% of professional services revenue is performed within the first year implying these fees are paid for customization and training. The combination of high gross margins in software which in 2014 were 85% and the zero gross margins in professional services average out to 69% which is right on the median for public SaaS companies. Netsuite is an financially disciplined company and they understand and can control the underlying drivers of their business well. As the charts show the company operates with a goal of 25% annual growth thereafter maximizing cash while operating at about -15% net income as percentage of revenue. Netsuite keeps about 14% of revenues as cash. Net income as a percentage of revenue is steady at around -15%. Netsuite’s sales efficiency is below the SaaS median of 0.6 at 0.3 but it has been rising in the last 5 years presumably as the company is able to cross-sell more of its product suite and also close bigger contracts. The company manages sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue to about 50% which is in line with the median. Research and development spending is again right on line with the median at 20%. Netsuite consistently achieves its growth goals and shows the hallmarks of a very well run and disciplined organization. The company’s leadership position in SaaS ERP is undeniable and it’s a great example of how operational discipline can generate enormous businesses even if the sales efficiency of the business isn’t at the top of the heap.

http://tomtunguz.com/vc-seed-strategy/,The Impact of VCs in Seed Rounds in Seven Charts,The Impact of VCs in Seed Rounds in Seven Charts For the past several years early stage VCs have entered the seed market with vigor. VC’s entry has resulted five different important trends in the past five years: The total dollars entering the seed market has increased by 132%. The mean seed round size has increased by 114% to $1.4M. VCs’ typical seed investment has grown by 50%. Mega-seeds those seed investments over $2M have reached historic highs exceeding 80 instances in 2013. The mean mega-seed round is $2.26M during the past five years but in 2013 that figure reached $2.8M which implies mega-seeds have replaced traditional early Series A. Though total number of seed investments increased by 30% comparing 2013 to 2011 but astoundingly the total dollars entering the seed ecosystem has increased by 132%. The impact of VCs on the seed market is hard to overstate. I’ve taken Crunchbase data and split the seed financings based on those with venture investors involved and those without. The typical angel round size over the same time period is shown below. Over the past six years the average round size has varied from about $200k to about $500k most recently. The median rests around $150k. Let’s compare this with the trends of seed rounds with VCs. Seed rounds with VCs are much bigger and have doubled in size in 5 years from $1M to more than $2M. The growth is statistically significant with greater than 95% confidence for all years. The trend is real. As these round sizes increase I wondered if VCs are investing more and underwriting larger investments or if VCs are syndicating more. The Crunchbase data indicates the average number of investors in a seed round involved with a VC is about 1.6; the median is 1.6. This data implies VCs are writing larger checks into seed investments. The next question is whether those larger checks occur throughout the ecosystem or only in certain segments. Let’s evaluate the quartiles of seed rounds over that time. A quartile analysis will tell us whether the trends impact the market as a whole or just certain parts of the market. The quartile chart above shows that the top of the market the 100% quartile has reached unbelievable heights with the most competitive seed rounds aka MegaSeeds raising in excess of $5M for the past few years. In these cases seed rounds are simply highly syndicated series As. Though it’s hard to see in the chart every other quartile has increased by more than 50% over the time period. One could argue the top part of the market is pulling the rest of the market up. Additionally the wave of newer institutional seed funds could be contributing to the increases in round sizes. The number of MegaSeeds has been steadily increasing from below 10 to more than 80 in about 5 years. And the chart below shows the distribution of MegaSeed round sizes over the time period. The mean mega-seed round is $2.2M over the time period and exceeded $2.75M in 2013. The seed market five years ago was a much quieter market than it is today. As VCs have entered the market they have increased the number of seeds and the dollars entering the market dramatically. Over time the increased competition in the market has steadily increased the size of seeds which has now reached a point that the largest seeds have replaced the traditional early Series A.

http://tomtunguz.com/working-with-a-retained-search-firm/,A Startup’s Step-by-Step Guide to Working with Recruiters; Setting Up the Process for Success,A Startup’s Step-by-Step Guide to Working with Recruiters “It’s something I thought I’d never do” one founder told me yesterday. He had hired a recruiter to help him grow his team. But at some point in time most quickly growing startups will need help forming their teams. We kicked off searches at two Redpoint companies in earlier this year in addition to several last year and I’ve been taking notes on each of the processes. One of my partners Tim Haley was a top recruiter in the valley for many years and having his experience and expertise has been invaluable. These are my notes: When to Hire a Search Firm When the time vs money calculus changes. Recruiting is expensive and fees can range from $10k to $100k+ depending on the role and the firm. Firms either charge on a contingency basis (success fee) or on a retainer (fixed fee per month). Seed stage companies typically can’t afford these services and so they allocate their time (instead of their dollars) to build pipelines. Having grown their balance sheets Series A companies often employ retained recruiters for key positions (VPE VPM VPS) and then hire contingency recruiters for building the eng team. In all cases it’s important to keep an eye on the costs. When the networks of the team and board cannot produce the right candidate pipeline. Most high level hiring processes begin with the CEO and the board rifling through LinkedIn or their CRMs to find relevant candidates. When that pipeline dries up a recruiter can be an effective solution. How to Pick a Search Firm Choose a firm like you hire an employee. The recruiter is a paid representative of your company. They should be excited about the opportunity for the business capable of selling the vision of the business and most importantly exude a personality that is culturally consistent with your startup. Reference the firm. Recruiters should be diligent about building a pipeline communicating the state of that pipeline and working seamlessly with the CEO/founder to advance candidates through the pipeline efficiently. The only way to verify their working style is by calling previous clients. Screen for ethics. Ethics is the sine qua non of the recruiting world. Poaching employees from previous clients is verboten. Match the role and the expertise of the firm. Every firm and each person within that firm will have an expertise. Ask about the expertise request sample candidate resumes and compare across firms to ensure the best fit. In-house or out-of-house Typically more junior searches are completed in-house with some firms deploying a recruiter to work within the startup to understand the company better reduce communication latency and also present a unified experience to candidates. This is common for engineering recruiting. For more senior searches out-of-house recruiters are the norm. Even publicly traded companies do this. How to Set Up the Process for Success Commitment to hiring. First all the key stakeholders must be in agreement to that the company needs to fill a role. This includes the founders the management team and the board. The person managing the process must also commit to prioritizing the search. Using recruiter as leverage to convince a team to hire results in a high failure rate and frustration all around. Establish consensus on the candidate profile. Before hiring a search firm the startup should have a reasonably good idea of the responsibilities background and role of the new hire(s). It’s critical that all the stakeholders reach consensus on this before the search. Don’t assume that everyone is in agreement but write down the requisition and solicit comments to be certain. Share and discuss this requisition with the recruiter. Of course this job requisition may evolve over time as the team learns through interviewing but most of the key requirements will remain. Write down and share the process. Every candidate should go through the same or very similar interview processes to establish a calibration among the hiring team. The key attributes of the role should be tested in interviews and verified with references. Use the start of the recruiting process to train the hiring team’s filter. Having the recruiter and most of the hiring team meet the first few candidates will ground conversations. Instead of speaking in hypotheticals about certain characteristics the hiring team can point to strengths and weaknesses in individuals and calibrate the trade-offs. Hurry slowly. There’s a Latin expression festina lente meaning hurry slowly that describes succinctly the pace of these search processes. The Bay Area job market is a bustling. To win candidates the hiring team must be responsive to candidates and aggressive with great prospects. But not rush! Leverage your assets. Ask the board of directors or advisors to help close candidates. Setting Up the Process for Success Like any team a hiring team needs to communicate well trust each other and agree to pursue the same goals. Hiring an external recruiter can accelerate the time to hiring a candidate dramatically. But it’s important to ensure that the search process is set up for success. I hope these notes will be helpful for you. Related: How to Build a Hiring Pipeline Published 2013-01-25,Published 2013-01-25
http://tomtunguz.com/the-future-is-here-its-just-not-evenly-distributed/,The Future Is Here It’s Just Not Evenly Distributed,The Future Is Here It’s Just Not Evenly Distributed An entrepreneur shared this quote with me a few weeks ago. The future is already here – it’s just not evenly distributed. William Gibson quoted in The Economist December 4 2003 I remembered it this morning when I drove past a Google self-driving car and then again a few minutes later when a Tesla whipped past me and a third time during the same commute when I dictated an email to my mobile phone. Sometimes living in the Bay Area does feel like the living in future. But to Gibson’s point not every region can claim to have self-driving cars on its highways or electric car ownership or smart phone penetration rates as high as the Bay Area. Why not? I think there are four main barriers to distributing the future better. These are the same four challenges startups must solve to succeed. And these needs actually determine the structure of most startups. Awareness: many people simply don’t know about Square or Expensify or Google Now. They haven’t seen or used the products because they’re too busy or otherwise engaged. Marketing and branding are the tools to drive education and awareness. Cost: new technologies cost money. With time and advances in manufacturing or cloud computing newer technologies become more efficient to produce and deliver but money will always be a barrier to adoption. Complexity: my father-in-law is a brilliant surgeon and audiophile. We’ve just set up Sonos in his living room with Pandora and Rdio and a bunch of other music services. This weekend I walked him through the set-up step by step over the phone and hearing him narrate the experience I realized how challenging technology can be for those who aren’t digital natives. Even though those three products Sonos Pandora and Rdio are known for their simplicity for many user they still aren’t simple enough. Complex product design limits adoption. That’s what Apple and Google do so well and why they attract hundreds of millions of users. Perceived value: for a long time the benefits of newer technologies aren’t appreciated even after a customer/user might be aware. Either the cost/benefit analysis isn’t strong enough or the need isn’t yet apparent to the end user. These four limits align well with the four major parts of a startup: Awareness is Marketing. Cost is Engineering. Complexity is Product Design. Perceived Value is Sales. A startup succeeds when it distributes the future better - and that means aiding awareness reducing cost eliminating complexity and selling the value of their product.

http://tomtunguz.com/ces-observations/,My Thoughts on CES: The Six Trends on the Show Floor,My Thoughts on CES: The Six Trends on the Show Floor Yesterday I walked the sprawling floor of the Consumer Electronics Show. These are the six key themes/trends I noted. The Coming of Era of Drones - I saw barrel-rolling quad-copters and parkouring wheeled robots dancing in synchrony to hiphop music. It was awe-inspiring and terrifying at the same time. If you watch the video I think you’ll agree the mechanisms to control drones are rapidly becoming more sophisticated. Setting aside regulatory questions there seem to be fewer and fewer barriers to large scale drone deployments in the very near future. The Internet of Things is Going Away - The moniker not the movement is disappearing. Internet of Things companies don’t sell themselves as such. Instead of focusing on the tech home security companies and wireless speaker companies and sensor companies and healh companies pitch value instead of technology. The Reinvention of the Car - BMW’s i3 an electric city car was ubiquitous and seemed to integrate with a great many services. Google announced the Open Automobile Alliance to enable more innovation within the car. I saw self-driving cars Toyota’s hydrogen fuel-cell concept Audi’s new screen/dials and Ford’s entirely solar-powered car which they claim can recharge its batteries from the sunlight in any US city. There’s rapid innovation in the powertrain and the software/electronics of the car. Not coincidentally these are probably the two most important axes of differentiation for car makers in the next decade. Searching for the Next Massive Hardware Market - Manufacturers are testing every permutation of device to find the next big success and releasing some Franken-devices in the process. The 10-inch consumer tablet shares the floor with a 12-inch pro-tablet. The mobile phone with camera sits next to a 21x optical zoom camera/phone. I saw tablets with keyboards and without tablets with dual-booting operating systems and even tablets without screens. These headless computers are little portable bricks of compute and storage that are designed to be connected and disconnected from screens at work and home. And of course there’s the seemingly perennial SMS-enabled refrigerator or washing machine. In short there was lots of spaghetti thrown on the walls and it’s unclear if any of the experiments will work or how large of a market any one of these niches represents. Commodification of Wearable Technology - I couldn’t tell the wearable technology products apart. Each of them report similar diagnostics. The form factors for watches pedometers scales and heart rate monitors aren’t distinguishable from each other. Some are differentiating on style and fashion. None of the software accompanying the devices seemed unique either. The commodification trend will continue until one of two things occurs. Either one competitor develops a proprietary sensor/analysis that resonates with the mass-market consumer or one company amasses enough users to become the de facto social and data hub for health information. Hunting for TV’s New Killer Feature - It seems to be harder and harder to sell TVs and the manufacturers are trying harder and harder. The 4K curved OLED screens are technical marvels and render stunning images. But these visual innovations don’t seem to provide the must-have-it factor of the original high-definition TVs. The content isn’t available at scale to demonstrate the quality advantages and the technology is rapidly approaching the limits of the human eye. All these order-of-magnitude improvements in displays seem to provide diminishing returns to the consumer. If anything the TV might be replaced by… AR/VR is Back - The momentum Oculus Rift and Google Glass have mustered has created a wake of clones and adjacent experiences. One startup showed an Oculus Rift connected to a mock assault rifle and a treadmill-like walking surface. Players can run and point and shoot in Call of Duty so the idea goes. There was quite a bit of innovation. Overall the three areas I came away most excited about for startups are: AR/VR  drones and inside-the-car. Published 2014-01-08,Published 2014-01-08
http://tomtunguz.com/biggest-buyers-software-in-2016/,The Biggest Buyers of Software Companies in 2016,The Biggest Buyers of Software Companies in 2016 In 2015 startups benefitted from a vibrant fund raising market. In 2016 I believe they will enjoy a very active acquisition environment. The roughly 60 or so publicly traded software companies hold more than $380B in cash and short term investments on their balance sheets. Though Microsoft Google Cisco and Oracle possess 75% of that cash 14 other companies have cash reserves of greater than $500M. If we examine the M&A activity measured by number of acquisitions announced through November 28 2015 across the largest 18 businesses we can see Google and Microsoft have become increasingly acquisitive over the past few years with Microsoft setting nearly doubling the number of acquisitions since Satya Nadella took the helm as CEO. In addition newer entrants like Workday and LinkedIn are beginning to enter the fray as their businesses continue to grow their product scope expands and they accumulate cash. Meanwhile Oracle and SAP’s activity has waned. These older businesses acquired substantial businesses in the past and have historically consummated the largest transactions including SAP buying Concur for $8.3B Oracle buying Responsys for $1.7B among others. Salesforce also pursued a more measured acquisition pace and dropped to fewer than 10 acquisitions in 2015 to date less than half of last year. This could be because of the dramatic increase in private SaaS valuations in 2015. If there are to be massive acquisitions of software companies in 2016 this list of roughly 20 companies are likely to be buyer. Their significant cash positions and substantial market caps enable them to swallow a $1B acquisitions. Newer companies like Splunk Service Now and Tableau each with market caps of greater than $7B and more than $500M in cash have the capacity to acquire startups for multi-hundreds of millions. Netsuite also with a market cap of about $7B has $372M in cash and is also another acquirer to watch. With substantial amounts of cash in their coffers and some very large market caps there are more than 20 software companies of note who could be quite active in the startup acquisition market in 2016.

http://tomtunguz.com/fast-sales-processes/,How Faster Sales Cycles Become a Competitive Advantage,How Faster Sales Cycles Become a Competitive Advantage Sales cycles the time from acquiring a lead to closing an account vary quite a bit by industry product type and price point. But universally speaking for startups shorter sales cycles are better. Maintaining a short sales cycle is a competitive advantage for several important reasons. First faster sales cycles accelerate the discovery of a repeatable sales process. Different sales approaches must be tested: which role to sell to? which pitch (cost or value)? how to handle particular objections? A 45 day sales cycle will find those answers twice as fast as a 90 day sales cycle. Faster and more frequent sales cycles enable quicker experimentation and ultimately a more rapid discovery process to the right initial sales process. Of course this also extends to marketing. Faster cycles mean the quality of different lead sources can be evaluated nimbly and marketing experiments require less time to conclude. Second faster sales cycles enable a company to more rapidly evaluate new sales candidates. With 45 day sales cycles an inside salesperson’s performance can be evaluated in the first 4-6 months of their tenure. Six months is four full sales cycles back-to-back. If a sales rep can’t close a few deals in that process - they aren’t a fit. Third faster sales velocity (the number of deals closed in a given month) is an incredible motivator. If sales cycles are short account executives can quickly establish a sense of momentum which makes the whole organization feel like it’s humming. Fourth the faster the sales cycle the faster the product improves. A startup develops a product offering and then takes it to market through its sales team. The sales team reverts back to the product team with market feedback. The quicker market feedback can be consistently incorporated into the roadmap the more rapidly a company can improve its product. Fifth faster sales cycles simplify financial planning. The company has better bookings and revenue predictability which means they can more accurately forecast when to increase the size of the sales teams when to increase marketing budgets and so on. Predictable businesses are more attractive to investors which simplifies capital raising. There are many other advantages to faster sales cycles. But I think this list is good enough to make the point. Whether deliberate or not many startups price their initial products at substantial discounts to their future price points or their competitors. Often this is a shrewd move because it helps startups accelerate their product market fit feedback cycles. Keep an eye on your sales cycles. Accelerating them can have a huge impact on your business.

http://tomtunguz.com/revenue-at-risk/,What Your Startup’s MRR Figure Is Hiding,"What Your Startup’s MRR Figure Is Hiding The three words roll off the tongue: monthly recurring revenue (MRR). What’s not to love about subscription models? Negative working capital predictable revenue growth and an average of 13x market cap to annual revenue in the public markets with some darlings reaching 50x multiples. The list goes on. But the words recurring revenue belies one small detail. These recurring customers must renew their subscriptions at which point another three word phrase is uttered: revenue-at-risk the amount of MRR that might be lost to customers who choose not to re-enlist. Recurring revenue isn’t an iron-clad figure. It’s subject to the rust caused by customer churn. The oft-quoted MRR figure is an optimistic one because it assumes 100% retention rate. Instead a better metric for MRR might be the expected value of monthly recurring revenue something along the lines of eMRR = MRR * (1-churn rate) The problem with eMRR is that typical SaaS churn rates are small varying between 1 to 3% per month so the eMRR doesn’t capture the compounding impact of high churn rates. Nick Mehta CEO at Gainsight showed me another way of visualizing revenue at risk that I’ve replicated in the chart below. Each point is a customer: many customers in the same location darken the dot. The x-axis is the months since a customer subscribed (cohort) and the y-axis is the monthly recurring revenue (MRR). This report shows three different trends: How much of revenue is up for renewal assuming 12 month upgrade cycles. How the price of the product trends with time and by cohort. How sales velocity is changing with time. I like this report quite a bit because at a glance I can get a sense of what’s happening with the business and pull-apart the MRR metric to understand the trends in the customer base and the potential revenue at risk. Nick’s product adds one more dimension to this chart and an important one. Gainsight integrates into Salesforce and determines on a per client basis which customers are truly at risk of churning. Instead of assuming quite broadly that all revenue in month 11 is at risk Gainsight’s report shows you the 10 to 30% or so that truly is at risk. That data isn’t encapsulated in my chart above but is quite useful. But if a low fidelity model is sufficient then the R code below might be useful because it produces the chart above. The Revenue at Risk chart is a fine tool for understanding at a high level the health of the customer base and the sales velocity. It sheds light on the true health of the MRR metric.

http://tomtunguz.com/pricing-experimentation/,How to Determine Which Price is Best for Your SaaS Startup's Product,How to Determine Which Price is Best for Your SaaS Startup's Product Pricing is one of the hardest things for startups to get right because there is no universal and constant price optimum. As a SaaS startup’s product evolves and offers more features the product’s price points should increase. As a sales team or marketing team engages different customer segments price points may vary wildly. The contract for a F500 should have very different pricing than a startup because of the stark contrast in the different companies’ willingness to pay and value associated with buying the product. When competitors influence the market place price points may change. Conferences seasonality news events business development relationships sales promotions all may impact pricing. Given the dynamic pricing environment the most effective way I’ve found to pursue the right pricing is to test constantly and then compare different prices’ effectiveness at maximizing customer lifetime value. This is the process I’ve been using to benchmark different price points. Determining if Price Points Impact Revenue Within a one customer segment or across the entire customer population divide the segment into two groups and sell at two different price points for a period of time that creates enough data to be statistically significant. My rough rule of thumb from statistics class is 30 in each bucket. Track these cohorts through the first renewal period or multiple renewal periods to measure revenue churn rate. Calculate expected value of a customer for each price experiment. The expected value I use is: revenue_from_initial_term+revenue_from_second_term x conversion_rate_for_segment - cost_to_sell_initial_period - cost_to_serve_all_time - costs_to_trigger_renewal_second_term - discounts/incentives/other This formula can be expanded to include as many renewal periods as the data allows. Use Student’s T-Test to determine if the means of the expected values across the different price experiments differ. In practice I use a p-value of < 0.01 as a measure of determining if one pricing model is better than another. In Excel this command is TTEST(). In R it’s t.test(). Graph the data on a boxplot to double check the distributions and make sure the conclusions make sense. This is my quick and dirty method for drawing conclusions from company data about which pricing models are working. Searching Google I came across quite a few products that do this on the Salesforce App Exchange but I haven’t seen many of these applications in the wild. I’m curious if other people have developed methods to test pricing for SaaS products across different segments that are more sophisticated or more automated.

http://tomtunguz.com/five-marketing-channels-saas-companies/,The 5 Marketing Channels of Great SaaS Companies,The 5 Marketing Channels of Great SaaS Companies Leads are the lifeblood of every SaaS company. As a SaaS startup grows the limiting factor of the business quickly becomes demand generation. Can the marketing team generate enough leads to for the inside sales team to attain their monthly quota? The Marketing team’s mandate is to generate these leads in a cost-effective way and develop a portfolio of lead-generation mechanisms. Ideally these generate inbound leads who often convert at 2-3x the rate of outbound leads. Below are the five marketing channels I’ve observed at SaaS companies. Channels - In the world of licensed enterprise software software companies pay channel partners called Value Added Resellers (VARs) and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) to sell install and customize software. This notion doesn’t really exist with SaaS companies because except for the most complex and customizable products like Salesforce most SaaS software is much simpler. Very little integration is required because these products tend to stand alone and customization and integration if needed are handled by internal engineering teams. But SaaS companies still do have channels available to them in the form of app stores from Salesforce Intuit Google and the Apple and Android mobile app stores. More importantly Xero has demonstrated that service providers accountants in this case can be amazingly efficient channels. The typical accountant using Xero refers between 6-31 customers to Xero depending on the geography (see slide 16). Xero convinces accountancies to adopt the platform and the accountants bring on their client base creating huge leverage to grow efficiently. User Actions - Dropbox’s refer a friend program is the canonical example of a user action to generate new leads and customers. Many companies have adopted these ideas including Evernote DigitalOcean EventBrite and Elance. When crafted and deployed well user actions and referrals are very efficient and effective ways of generating new potential customers. But referral marketing has to be managed well because the fraud risk and consequent revenue cannibalization for the business can be material. Content Marketing - The newest of the marketing channels and still the least well understood channel content marketing has blossomed because the software buying process has changed. Buyers want to educate themselves before engaging with a salesperson. Content marketing takes many forms: blogs white papers social media engagement eBooks videos and so on. Unlike the other forms of marketing listed here content marketing is the only channel with compounding and long term returns. Because of its cost advantages the only real costs are the salaries of the staff to create the content and the team to build/manage the syndication testing and optimization tools and occasional paid promotion of content content marketing can be incredibly efficient. In addition it can provide massive scale. Hubspot which attracts more than 1M visitors to their blog each month epitomizes of this strategy. Last the right kinds of content can generate leads for years unlike the fleeting clicks of a paid marketing campaign. Advertising - AdWords LinkedIn Facebook ads. Internet/mobile paid customer acquisition varies in effectiveness by the type of product. The simpler and more consumer-like the product the more likely paid ads are to immediately trigger a download or a signup. Paid ads are sometimes used to drive potential buyers to white papers and other content but this can get pretty expensive really quickly. For example to buy 100 clicks per day on AdWords I would need to spend $470 daily according to the Keyword Planner or about $14k per month. If 10% of those who click fill out a lead form and 50% of those leads are valid and 15% of the leads convert to paying customers then the marketing cost of customer acquisition is $626 (excluding the time and commission costs of the inside sales team member who closed the account). At those estimated rates only BI products with annual price points of about $1k or more can justify the investment. Some advertising like billboards on Highway 101 develop brand awareness which is important in the long term but isn’t a material driver of leads in short term. Events - In addition to attending major trade shows like Dreamforce many SaaS companies have created their own events. In the customer success segment Gainsight runs Pulse and Totango hosts Customer Success Summit. Events like these are a great way to reinforce a company’s brand message engage the company’s external champions and retain key customers. But they can be expensive. For a 200-300 person event budgets are typically in the $250k-$500k gross cost range which can be offset by sponsorships. Given these costs it’s often hard to back into a reasonable cost of customer acquisition from a dedicated event. So they must serve multiple goals. Smaller more frequent events like Looker’s Look and Tell can also be effective customer engagement education and closing tools. Great SaaS marketing organizations combine these different marketing channels and test them frequently. Having more than one marketing channel provides the marketing department several levers to pull when needing to accelerate lead volumes for the sales team.

http://tomtunguz.com/successful-saas-sectors/,The Most Successful SaaS Sectors,The Most Successful SaaS Sectors In every sales process for every SaaS startup there is one ultimate internal champion advocating the purchasing decision. And it’s their budget that will be used to pay for it. So which departments within customers spend most on SaaS? One way of looking at this question is to compare the successes of software companies targeting different departments. I have categorized the 50 or so publicly traded SaaS companies by their principal buyer and tallied the aggregate market caps of those companies above. Software companies targeting Human Resources and Sales teams are in aggregate each worth about $50B. Next companies targeting IT are worth approximately $40B. After that there’s a steep decline to about $10B for Finance and Marketing. Company Category Share of MC Salesforce Sales 92% Zendesk CS 77% New Relic Eng 67% NetSuite Finance 62% LinkedIn HR 53% As the table above shows the Sales category is dominated by Sales force which represents 92% of the market capitalization in that category. It is a bit unfair to lump all of Salesforce’s revenue into sales because the product spans sales marketing and support. Nevertheless the majority of the revenue remains from sales teams. The next most dominant company in a category is Zendesk which represents 77% of the Customer Support/Success market cap today. Then there is New Relic NetSuite and LinkedIn all about 50% of their categories. How should these trends change with time? I suspect sales will always be in the top one or two categories because if software enables a sales team to be more productive and it is ROI positive then there’s always the case to be made to buy it. The same is true for Human Resources. Companies are always looking to hire and tools that provide them competitive advantage in recruitment can be very well justified. Surprisingly Marketing is on the smaller end of the spectrum. Gartner has forecasted that by 2017 CMOs will spend more money than CIOs which should eventually translate to substantial increases in the aggregate market caps of marketing SaaS companies. The Engineering and Customer Success categories are both relatively new. It’s only recently that the consumerization of IT has led to substantial spending on tools by engineering teams. One blind spot in this analysis is it fails to look at the total value of SaaS acquisitions. If we were look only at the top six they would add about $50B or so to the data set. out of the top six largest acquisitions three of them are for Human resources companies: Taleo ($1.8B) Kenexa ($1.3B) and SuccessFactors ($3.6B) so this data would likely only further skew the existing results in favor of HR. These historical trends are interesting but it’s very difficult to use them to predict the future. And after all there are quite a few fast-growing software companies scaling very quickly that should go public in the next few years that could meaningfully skew this data.

http://tomtunguz.com/netsuite-key-metric/,Unpacking the Deep Diagnostic Value of LTV/CAC for SaaS Startups,Unpacking the Deep Diagnostic Value of LTV/CAC for SaaS Startups In a recent podcast Ron Gill the CFO of Netsuite - a $7B+ market cap company with about $600M in 2014 revenue which provides ERP software to mid-market companies - articulated the importance of the Lifetime Value / Cost of Customer Acquisition (LTV/CAC) ratio for his company. LTV/CAC is often used to justify marketing and sales investment to acquire customers. But there’s much more to it. LTV/CAC is a powerful diagnostic tool for the performance of almost every team within the company: product engineering sales and marketing. Gross margin which is an important factor in LTV reflects the engineering architecture and the hosting costs required to support customers. Average revenue per customer is a function of the product and the sales efficiency (and arguably marketing/positioning.) The chart above isn’t meant to be comprehensive but illustrate for a hypothetical company some of the constituent parts of the LTV/CAC. A real tree would be much more granular and could extend several layers deeper. In the past few years Netsuite’s LTV/CAC ratio has more than doubled (an impressive feat given the stage of the business). In the 2009-2011 period churn mitigation improved the LTV/CAC. At some point the company couldn’t squeeze any more juice from that lemon. Companies churned from Netsuite because they went out of business or were acquired not because they selected a competitor. More recently as Netsuite has moved up market and the larger average revenue per customer has improved the LTV/CAC. To identify the most important contributors impacting the LTV/CAC Netsuite performs a regression on the underlying variables. Afterwards the company calculates the ratio’s sensitivity to each variable to understand the potential improvement attainable by focusing on reducing hosting costs for example. These analyses lead to a set of priorities for the business which will ultimately improve LTV/CAC. Tracking the metric over time provides SaaS companies with an indicator for the health of the business. But because the LTV/CAC ratio is a composite number which encapsulates many other key figures it shouldn’t be used as the exclusive measure for the health of the business but as an instrument to question the underlying dynamics as those contributing factors can change the LTV/CAC ratio dramatically. Understanding the major drivers of this metric the contributions of each team and the sensitivity to investments in particular departments is a great way to prioritize internal growth and retention efforts for SaaS startups.

http://tomtunguz.com/trends-in-founder-compensation/,Surprising Trends in Startup Founder Equity Stakes,Surprising Trends in Startup Founder Equity Stakes Earlier this week I wrote about the increase in cash compensation and decline in equity grants to VPs of Engineering and Product in startups. I received a lot of comments about the analysis and in particular hypotheses to explain the data. I dug a bit deeper into the data set to find an explanation. Founding employees keep more equity today than ever through the Series A and Series B. On average founders retain 30-33% more equity than 4 years ago through those first two rounds of institutional investment. For the statisticians out there this change is statistically significant with greater than 99% confidence on an average yearly sample size about 200+ data points per year per role. The chart above shows the trends in four graphs. The graphs are broken out by last Series of investment (A B C and D) and show the equity compensation trends of CEOs VP of Engineering and VP of Product. The gray shadows around the lines represent the 95% confidence intervals. In 2014 the median founding CEO equity stake after raising a Series A is 21% up from 15% in 2009. The trend is similar for Series B companies. On the whole the founder stakes for founding VPEng and VPProduct have remained relatively stable. The much higher variances of equity stakes for these two positions make it difficult to draw a statistically significant conclusion about trends. Let’s compare founder equity trends with non-founders in the chart below. Non-founder equity grants have remained relatively constant over time with a recent spike in post-Series A CEO compensation apparent in the last year. If the capitalization table of a startup has 100% and the compensation for founders is increasing and the compensation for non-founders is staying constant whose share is contracting? Venture capitalists. Pitchbook’s Q4 Series A and B valuation data copied below shows a greater than 44% increase in median startup valuations during the same time period as the compensation study above. But Crunchbase data indicates that round sizes have remained relatively constant. So on the whole as valuations in startupland have increased investors have held their check size relatively constant and consequently founders are retaining more equity in their businesses.

http://tomtunguz.com/non-balance-sheet-equity.md/,The Valuable Startup Equity That's Not Captured in Your Cap Table,The Valuable Startup Equity That's Not Captured in Your Cap Table I met a founder a few days ago who captured the idea of building brand equity really well. He said something along the lines of “Every time we provide a magical experience to a customer we invest in our brand equity. Each time we do something that disappoints them or overtly extracts value from our users we expend brand equity.” This founder prided himself on continuously investing in and increasing his business’s brand equity over long periods of time. Brand equity is important because it can become a significant part of a company’s value. I copied the image above from an annual Interbrand report on the most valuable brands in the world. In many cases the brand equity of these businesses are a material fraction of their market caps. The brand recognition and goodwill customers feel towards these brands is an enormously powerful marketing force and hugely-defensible competitive advantage. In fact Peter Thiel wrote about brand as a core asset of the best startups in his recent book Zero to One. But brand equity isn’t a topic of many conversations in Startupland because unlike revenue gross margin cost of customer acquisition or lead velocity for startups immediate changes in brand equity are nearly impossible to quantify. In addition private companies may have more difficulty convincing investors of the intangible value of a brand. While there are a few popular metrics used to proxy the value of a company’s brand equity like Net Promoter Score which may be the most popular one or referrals as a fraction of total new customer leads these metrics are like the three blind men feeling different parts of the elephant. They capture part of the concept but not the essence of it. But as this founder pointed out to me perhaps the accurate measurement of brand equity isn’t the best way to think about it. There’s a mantra many of us subscribe to: “If you can’t measure something you can’t understand it. If you can’t understand it you can’t control it. If you can’t control it you can’t improve it.” This maxim’s roots lie in Total Quality Management a branch of operations research to maximize factory output. Needless to say TQM cares little for brand or external perception. In addition to forming a material part of a company’s value and becoming a powerful marketing advantage a company that champions brand equity internally will make product decisions in the best interest of their customers. Said more succinctly focus on the user and all else will follow. This long term view shapes the culture of a startup’s workplace and reinforce values that will attract talented people whose mission aligns with the business. When confronted with an important product or marketing or sales decision if each member of a startup asks how can we build our brand equity with this? then a startup’s management team can rest easy knowing the company is building a long-term competitive advantage a culture to recruit great talent a loyal customer base and an asset of compounding value to the business. Even if they can’t measure it. Published 2014-10-01,Published 2014-10-01
http://tomtunguz.com/the-hardest-round-to-raise/,The Hardest Round to Raise for Startups,The Hardest Round to Raise for Startups Over the past few years I’ve debated the existence of a Series A crunch and found in that analysis that the volume of Series As was increasing. This trend hasn’t abated. The number of Series As has grown by 31% annually for the past 5 years reaching more than 831 Series As in 2013 up from 284 in 2009. In short no founder should be concerned about the Series A market. Rather the Series B market is worrisome. At the moment Series Bs are the hardest rounds to raise for startups. The data proves the point. The chart above compares the number of Series A rounds and the number of Series B rounds recorded by Crunchbase over the past eight years. Series As have grown dramatically by more than 30% per year. In contrast Series Bs lag behind at 10% annual growth. Before 2013 the Series B market was basically flat. Let’s dig one level deeper into the Series As and Bs by round size. The first chart below shows smaller Series As those with investment sizes under $5M drive the majority of growth in round volumes. $5-$10M rounds the brown line have grown more modestly. Relatively speaking all other round sizes are flat and irrelevant. The Series B charts by round size tell us that sub $5M Series Bs are also the fastest growing segment followed by $5 to $15M Series Bs. But the number of $5 to $15M Series Bs hasn’t changed since 2007. Again larger rounds are largely irrelevant because their numbers are just too small to be significant. Despite the 3x increase in Series A rounds led the Series B dollars haven’t grown to support an additional 400 startups in the market for a Series B. Needless to say competition in the Series B market is heating up! I’ll speculate about why this is the case. Perhaps there’s a latency in the market and investors need a few years to seize upon the opportunity. Perhaps there has always been a significant difference in the size of Series B and Series A dollars because the post Series A companies are acquired or fail at a substantial rate. While there has been an enormous expansion of seed funds that catalyze Series A rounds there has not been an equal expansion in the number of Series B firms which require larger funds and are harder to raise as a first-time fund manager investor. I’m not sure which is the right answer or if it’s a combination of all of them. In any case the conclusion is clear. Right now Series Bs are the hardest rounds to raise. The competition for Series B dollars is about 3x as intense as a few years ago*. Now more than ever founders ought to reverse engineer their startup’s Series B pitch to maximize their chances of success. I’m assuming that the rates of company acquisition company failure and general founder behaviors have remained constant over the past ten years. Unfortunately it’s hard to prove this point using the Crunchbase data because it’s too noisy. Published 2014-03-21,Published 2014-03-21
http://tomtunguz.com/emotional_intelligence/,The Characteristics of the Most Successful Teams,The Characteristics of the Most Successful Teams The best teams share two common attributes according to MIT research: Relatively equal contribution by each member Members with high emotional intelligence. The first characteristic makes sense. A team led by a single dominant person will perform according to the strengths and weaknesses of the (benevolent) dictator. Another team in which the strengths of one member complement the weaknesses of another will certainly be stronger. The second quality high emotional intelligence while talked about quite a bit in interviewing training and management training surprised me. But understanding and anticipating others’ feelings seems to the lubricant to help teams achieve greater performance. Amazingly emotional intelligence impacts team performance as much when working remotely by email or Skype as in person. Interviewing for emotional intelligence can be tricky. After all how can one reliably measure it in a 45 to 60 minute interview? Well there’s a test for it. A Harvard research lab has published a 60 second test called “The Reading of the Eyes” that asks respondents to gauge the emotion of a person using only their eyes and this ability is highly correlated to emotional intelligence. I scored a 30 of 36. My wife who is much smarter than I am scored a near perfect 35 of 36. On the whole women tend to score about 0.5 points more than men. Both of these characteristics share one behavior in common: listening. Equal contribution from team members requires actively listening and considering other points of view. Interpreting feelings is listening of a different kind less factual more emotional. The data proves what some have known for a long time: “The reason why we have two ears and only one mouth is so we may listen more and talk less.” (Epictetus) Published 2015-01-20,Published 2015-01-20

How do they go about managing people? How do they maintain the values of the business? The underlying question of successful management is: How can founders lead and learn at the same time? I think a bastardized version Tolstoy’s well-worn refrain is apt: Happy teams are all alike; every unhappy team is unhappy in its own way. Anna Karenina on Startups After that conversation I reflected on the culture at Google and why I thought it was great. These are the values I found there: Listening: the sine qua non of collaboration. Listen absorb reflect and respond. All communication starts with listening. Shared Learning: Some of us are experienced in one area. Others are learning from the first time. But we can all teach each other along the way and we must help each other particularly when chasing new ideas. Freedom to Whiff: Notice it’s not freedom to fail. Freedom to whiff means working in a team that allows you to take a big swing and miss. But the next time you’d better hit the ball. Abject failure without subsequent success isn’t acceptable. Community Building: Caring about your people is the most fundamental part of management. Inquiring about their daily lives lauding their successes supporting them through their struggles. Employees aren’t resources; they’re people first and foremost. Obligation to Dissent: Peter Drucker wrote the story of Alfred Sloan the former CEO of GM who entered a board meeting to discuss an important issue before the company. Sloan asked the opinions of his directors. When everyone agreed without comment he immediately stopped the board meeting and said something along the lines of “Since we’re all in agreement it’s clear no one has considered the issue. Let us reconvene tomorrow after giving the matter appropriate thought.” Empowering Leaders at Every Level: Leaders pull the organization forward toward big hairy audacious goals. But leaders don’t just exist at the C-level. Every team every group every project. Being a leader doesn’t mean knowing it all but reinforcing the values above.

On the web you can launch a product that’s 80% functional to hit a promised launch date. Around 1 am that night when most users are asleep you can surreptitiously push an update with bug fixes and new features reboot the servers and no one is the wiser. iOS apps don’t work this way. A mobile app with a serious bug frustrates users for two weeks inundates customer support for a fortnight and decreases app rankings for at least that long. Quite an expensive bug. Apple’s two week app approval window creates this dynamic. The approval latency demands higher quality software which means better testing and higher quality standards. To cope with these greater demands developers are tweaking web tools for mobile app development. In a post on FastCo Labs HowAboutWe’s engineering team described their quality assurance (QA) process. They combine Kiwi KIF and CruiseControl to trigger automated tests before their iOS app releases. One of these tools is mobile specific. But Kiwi and CruiseControl are ports from Ruby web testing toolkits. Longer release cycles decrease the number of experiments a team can run because each optimization more than 2 weeks to test measure and update. Thankfully a handful of startups have created frameworks to dynamically test optimize and updating mobile applications in the wild. These frameworks effectively recreate the web delivery model. With a flip of a switch on a remote server a mobile app can improve its UI instantly. As mobile users become the majority of users more and more of the advantages of web development will be brought to mobile applications and mobile users will be better served.

http://tomtunguz.com/declining-follow-on-success-rates/,The Decreasing Follow On Financing Success of Startups,The Decreasing Follow On Financing Success of Startups The rate at which startups are raising follow-on rounds is decreasing and has decreased steadily from 2003 through 2013. Between 2003 and 2006 post-Series A startups raised series Bs about 57% of the time. However from 2011-2014 that figure fell to 28%. The same trend is true in series C rounds where success rates fell from 43% to 35%. This decline in startup follow-on fundraising success is the result of an increased number of series A which have been growing at a rate of 18% per year since 2009. Meanwhile series Bs and series Cs were steady over the same period. As the number of series As has increased the sizes of the As have remained constant. In 2014 the median series A was $5.5M the roughly the same as the average over the past decade. 2015 seems to buck the trend with a median of $8M but the year is still young so it’s too early to tell. Meanwhile series B and C each have doubled since 2009. More and more early-stage companies are raising the $5.5M standard series A. A “fixed” number of startups each year are able to raise follow-on rounds and when they do those rounds are twice as big as they were five years ago. This contrasting growth of the series A market and stability in the series B and C market depresses follow-on success rates. Lastly the decline in follow-on rates does not seem to be tied to longer period between rounds. In other words irrespective of the size of a startup’s financing round whether in the series A or series B follow-on rounds are typically raised 500 days after the previous one closes. And this is true for every quartile of company. Meaning even the fastest rounds today are happening just as fast as they were 10 years ago. The chart above shows the data for follow on rates from series A to series B. Ultimately this data implies that there is plenty of Series A capital available for startups. And other analysis shows that there is plenty of capital for later stage rounds for startups. However the fundraising market has a barbell profile where the amount of capital allocated to series B and series C is relatively fixed. With a greater number of series A companies competing for a finite amount dollars there is greater competition and consequently the follow-on success rate has dropped by about half. Notes about the analysis: I used capital IQ data for this analysis. I screened for US venture backed IT and online retailing companies. For most of these analyses I only look at companies that had raised follow ons. In the “Follow On Success Rate Chart” the x-axis is the year of the either the series A in the case of series A-to-B conversion or the Series B in the case of the series B-to-C conversion.

http://tomtunguz.com/churn-predictability-valuation/,Why Your Startup's Churn Rate Affects Your Company's Ability to Plan Its Future,Why Your Startup's Churn Rate Affects Your Company's Ability to Plan Its Future Every SaaS company should be focused on mitigating churn because greater retention enables a business to grow far more rapidly to reduce the cost of customer acquisition and to slash the amount of capital required for the business to grow. But there’s one additional reason to focus on churn: predictability. The more dollar churn a business creates the less predictable its performance - and vice versa. Let’s paint the picture for a hypothetical startup which generated $2M in revenue last year and forecasts growing to $5M this year for 150% annual growth. The chart above plots the Carry Over Revenue for the company as a function of annual dollar churn rate. Carry Over Revenue is the fraction of this year’s revenue generated by renewing customers. If the business achieves 0% dollar churn 40% of this year’s revenue is already locked in (the company will generate $5M this year and renewal customers will pay $2M of it.) If on the other hand the company churns 50% annually about 20% of revenue/$1M can be predicted on January 1 about half of the previous case. And if the company generates negative churn where the customer accounts increase in value over time the carry over percentage grows to close to 50%. Of course the faster a company grows the smaller its Carry Over Revenue will be. For example if the business were growing at 300% at 0% churn the Carry-Over revenue would represent 25% of this year’s revenue. The goal isn’t to maximize Carry Over Revenue in the absolute. If a business achieves 100% COR all of its business this year was last year’s business then it won’t grow at all (unless the business has negative churn)! Rather the aim should be to minimize churn to increase the business’ predictability. Predictable businesses are desirable businesses. If a startup can forecast to a greater accuracy how the business will perform the startup’s management team can make better decisions about when to grow the team increase marketing spend raise capital among many other decisions. The company is one step closer to creating a money-making machine. Published 2015-03-16,Published 2015-03-16

FailCon is not the Darwin Awards for startups. Founders do not start businesses with the express interest to fail. Instead the valley is infatuated with the post-mortem of failures and successes alike because within every venture are pearls of wisdom - a subtle but important difference. Extracting and applying these insights can be the difference between success and failure. This is why founders pursue knowledge relentlessly. Ultimately iteration and learning speed is the hallmark of great startup teams Startups are vehicles designed to test hypotheses: Will millions of users participate in a photo sharing network? Will tens of thousands of businesses pay $10 per month for easy to use expense reports. Understanding what worked and what didn’t is essential to maximizing the odds of success for new ventures. The valley in its entirety is structured to share learnings. Founders create huge information dissemination groups in person and through blogs. Incubators accelerators and others have become de facto vocational training institutes. Advisors and VCs join boards to share experiences. And successful entrepreneurs return to their stomping grounds to regale newer founders with stories of their trials tribulations and ultimate successes. The ambit of every one of these is success - not failure. The confusion is caused because we are overloading the term: fail fast fail forward etc and we may be doing ourselves a mild-disservice using these terms. But all of these concepts focus on learning quickly. This dogged pursuit of insight knowledge and truth is at the core of the valley - not failure. Published 2013-01-28,Published 2013-01-28
http://tomtunguz.com/cash-and-debt-by-year/,SaaS Startup Balance Sheets: How Much Cash & How Much Debt to Raise,SaaS Startup Balance Sheets: How Much Cash & How Much Debt to Raise After reading a few of the S-1 analyses on this blog an entrepreneur asked me to look into the balance sheets of public SaaS companies. More specifically how much cash should SaaS hold? How much equity do they raise? And do they employ debt to grow? The chart above shows the median cash on the balance sheet by year of founding for publicly traded SaaS companies. By its second year in business the median SaaS company in this data has about $7M on its balance sheet at year two from either the combination of a large seed round and Series A or just a large A. The company grows quickly enough to raise a $12-$25M Series B in the next 12-18 months which is year 3 or 4 in the company’s life. The business deploys that capital to continue growth at which point it raises another $20-30M in its Series C in year five and another $20-$30M in year six which should be the final round before IPO. Most often SaaS publics IPO in year seven but this figure varies quite a bit. Let’s look at the net income data to see how much of the venture capital the median SaaS company consumes over time. The bar chart above depicts the median net income by year since founding. In year 3 the net income is about -$5M then -$11M. The net annual loss peaks in years 5 and 6 at just about -$14M. In all the median publicly traded SaaS company invests $60M to develop its product and grow before it goes public. In addition it holds about $28M in on its balance sheet at IPO for a median total raise of about $88M before IPO. The typical size of a SaaS IPO is $82M In total the median SaaS publicly traded company raises $170M in total through IPO. Now for the question of debt. 60% of SaaS publics have employed debt of some sort before going public. But as the chart above shows the median amount of debt is quite small at or below $1M every year. In other words the vast majority of SaaS growth to date has been paid for with equity dollars. This may be for a few reasons. First the equity markets have provided large amounts capital relatively cheaply. Second debt must be repaid. Most SaaS companies operate at negative net income so the debt repayment is unlikely to be made from free cash flow. Instead it will be repaid with equity dollars. If equity can be raised easily why bother with debt? After IPO it’s a different story. I’ve plotted the debt patterns by company above and changed the x-axis to be years before/after IPO. It’s much more common to see SaaS companies raise debt after IPO than before at which point they may raise huge amounts. Salesforce for example has about $2.5B in debt. NetSuite has about $200M. But these are exceptional cases many years after IPO. In the early stages of SaaS companies debt is either used in relatively small amounts compared to equity or simply not at all. I should note there are many successful paths to market and the median doesn’t mean the right path to market. I have written extensively about Veeva which raised only $4.5M before going public. This analysis is for the median SaaS company in a basket of 41 companies with S-1s and the median hides a lot of variation in the data. Published 2014-09-16,Published 2014-09-16
http://tomtunguz.com/content-marketing-traffic-drivers/,A Surprising Source of Traffic for Breakout Content Marketing,A Surprising Source of Traffic for Breakout Content Marketing Each year I do a retrospective analysis of this blog. This year I found something unexpected. Like many other content sites just a handful of posts on this blog generate the majority of the traffic. I’ve plotted the distribution of traffic by post above; it’s clearly governed by a power law. The top 2% of posts generated 19% of traffic the top 10% account for 48% and the top 20% attracted 69% (Pareto would be vindicated). None of that data is surprising. However the source of traffic for the exceptionally successful posts is unexpected. The chart above shows the share of traffic generated by each channel. Twitter and Facebook which dominate the social channels generate 40% of traffic in aggregate. Direct people typing in tomtunguz.com generates about 35% and so on. This data naturally led me to the conclusion that social is critical for generating exceptionally successful posts. This aggregate analysis works in the case of normal or Gaussian distributions but it breaks down when the data is governed by a power law. Let’s break down posts by quartile and look at traffic source for each of them. Social consistently generates about 40% of traffic across all the quartiles. Direct traffic is also relatively constant as a share of traffic across all posts. However referring sites expands from about 5% in the 25th and 50th quartiles but explodes to 25% of total traffic for the best performing posts. In retrospect this makes sense. Highly trafficked sites send lots of referral traffic. When a blog post resonates with the readers of that site some of them come to explore this blog more deeply. The data illustrates why content syndication and collaboration with other sites is so important for content marketing - a useful end of the year insight. Over the past year on this blog Twitter followers have tripled traffic has tripled and email subscribers have more than quadrupled. In short everything is up to and to the right. I want to thank everybody for the inspiration advice feedback suggestions and support over the past year. On to 2015! Published 2014-12-19,Published 2014-12-19
http://tomtunguz.com/yc_investment_trends_2015/,Startup Trends from YCombinator's Demo Day,Startup Trends from YCombinator's Demo Day I’ve been to many YC Demo Days and I always look forward to them. This year was no exception. There are so many wonderful ideas and companies founded by terrific entrepreneurs. In addition to the pitches themselves the types of companies presenting forbear trends in the startup world more broadly. To get a better sense of those trends I’ve categorized more than 250 startups in 3 recent classes and plotted the evolution of the classes. The bar chart above shows that the split between consumer and enterprise has remained constant over these three classes. Healthcare companies those focusing on drug discovery or deeper diagnostics have notably risen in number in 2015. This increase in activity seems to be driven by advances in data analysis for drug discovery and novel sensors. Looking into consumer YC startups more deeply a few salient trends emerge. First commerce startups have increased steadily and represent 10% of the last class. This trend opposes the broader VC market’s investment patterns. Consumer services which includes consumer search dating daily deals and others have steadily declined potentially because of increased competition in those categories. Startups pursuing consumer finance have popped recently not driven by Bitcoin but by a wave of founders bringing more sophisticated financial tools to the masses. Gaming is out of fashion following the broader market. Surprisingly media companies spiked this year driven by a Twitch for X phenomenon. On Demand companies both food delivery services and logistics are constant. Last the decline of social media investment is consistent with the rest of the market. Growth investors have been pursuing social media companies at twice the rate of seed stage investors. Turning to enterprise collaboration tools have fallen likely dissuaded from entering the fray by the huge success of Slack and others. Financial management tools like expense management or receivables financing are growing steadily. The important story in Enterprise YC companies is the prominence of vertical SaaS - e.g. construction real estate and legal software - all industries who have yet to modernize and so present terrific opportunities to build big businesses. Last sales and marketing software products have declined in popularity also potentially because of the tremendous competition in those segments. One analyst counts more than 2000 software products catering to marketing teams up from 1000 the year before. Demo Day is a window into the future of consumer and enterprise investments. If this data is any indication we should see more commerce and consumer finance companies; and more vertical software businesses in the next few years. Published 2015-08-20,Published 2015-08-20
http://tomtunguz.com/this-message-will-destruct-in-48-seconds/,This Message Will Self-Destruct in 48 Seconds,This Message Will Self-Destruct in 48 Seconds If you’re building a startup content marketing is a powerful tool to build a brand develop customer relationships and develop a a hiring pipeline. Blogging requires diligence and a few tricks to build a following. I’ve been writing for about 3 years and I’ve analyzed a few hundred of my posts to better understand what makes for effective content marketing. These are my lessons learned: I have 48 seconds to get my message across in this post. No pretty images no increase or decrease in word count no amount of retweets or favorites will convince the reader to linger. Giving any indication to the reader that they are about to read a long post is death. Paragraph headings are the best indication of that a post will be long and these posts have 20% higher bounce rates when a user immediately hits the back button after landing on page. The reader doesn’t care about images. Images don’t impact any metric I tracked: page views time on site retweets favorites or bounce rate. Images may attract users to click when they are browsing but anyone who lands directly on a blog post is ambivalent about them. If the reader likes what they read they will poke around the site some more. The relationship between time on page and time on site is very strong. Writing good content matters and surfacing related material pays off. Social proof works and its huge. Social drives about 45% of visitors to the blog. Importantly there is no degradation in traffic quality from social networks. Visitors who arrive at the blog through retweets spend the same amount of time and have similar bounce rates to other visitors. In short when you start your content marketing strategy be brief get to the point and write great stuff. The rest will take care of itself. Published 2013-11-17,Published 2013-11-17
http://tomtunguz.com/speed-in-email/,The Magic of Email Snooze,The Magic of Email Snooze In a recent First Round Review article former Google President of Enterprise Apps Dave Girouard voiced the importance of speed in making decisions. “Deciding on when a decision will be made from the start is a profound powerful change that will speed everything up.” I believe this statement is broadly true and no where else is it more tangible for me than in managing daily email. After all what is responding to email other than a thousand decisions? Our inboxes aren’t in our control. Which emails arrive when they arrive we can’t determine. We do control how we engage with email but I find it’s easy for me to fall into the abyss of treating emails as a task list. Without a good discipline email overruns my day. There’s a concept from computer engineering called LIFO which stands for last in first out. LIFO captures this mentality beautifully. Most email UIs frame the situation in a LIFO queue: the last message received is the first one to receive a response even if it may not merit the priority. For years I treated email as a LIFO queue. With this workflow I found it impossible to get to the bottom of my inbox and be effective. Until I found the email snooze button. Like its alarm clock cousin the email snooze button delays the interruption. Email snooze removes an email from the inbox until a later date and time. I first came across email snooze in Dropbox’s Mailbox. Now I use Google’s Inbox which has the same feature. And Boomerang has it too. Email snooze has become an essential feature of email for me. When opening an email the first question I ask myself is “when do I need to answer this?” If immediately then I reply. Otherwise I snooze the email until I need to respond. And then my inbox is clear. So is my mind because I’m focusing on the things that matter now. Published 2015-08-11,Published 2015-08-11
http://tomtunguz.com/lessons-learnt-on-blogging-3-years-in/,What I’ve Learned about Blogging in 3 Years,What I’ve Learned about Blogging in 3 Years I have been writing for three years now and it’s been a ton of fun. I hope to continue to write for many more. Along the way so far I’ve learned a few lessons on frequency content type idea generation voice titles and distribution. Frequency There are two schools of thought on blogging frequency: high frequency vs high quality. At this point it’s unclear to me which is better for building an audience because both work. Each camp has its exemplars of success. In the frequency camp Fred Wilson posts every day and I suspect this is because when he started seven years ago it was essential to write daily to train an audience to visit avc.com. Today social media (twitter hacker news) generates most of the traffic for a blog by bubbling up the best content. Building a core audience that visits tomtunguz.com every day is important to me but I post every day because each writing book I’ve read recommends it. And I figure if I’m writing a blog post I may as well publish it. I write sometime between 5 and 7am each morning when it’s quiet and I can focus. Flights are also good times for blogging. Representing the other point of view Chris Dixon and Paul Graham pen monthly essays and posts which are better revised and often succinct witty and always very well written. This technique concentrates engagement maximizes social media reach and ensures great content. Content Type I never can predict with much accuracy which content will resonate with readers who tend to be startup founders and employees. But the most successful posts tend either to create an emotional connection through a personal story or share some detailed tactical advice. The best posts enable readers to see a reflection of themselves in the story because they have or are living through something similar. Reading and dissecting classic novels and well written magazine articles helped me begin to understand how other authors do this well. Burt Helm from Inc magazine shared this GQ article about Suicide Catchers in China as a great example of storytelling. One example of a successful emotional/storytelling post is “The Biggest Challenge of My Professional Career: Communication” And “Your Startup’s 10 Most Important Metrics” is example of a very tactical post that readers enjoyed. Ideas Writing every day demands lots of ideas. I jot down notes during conversations sift through my calendar read the news and examine what’s trending on social media. Sometimes I don’t have any ideas and to jog a stream I search for a strong opinion or reaction I’ve had recently. That seems to help breaking my writer’s block. I keep a list of these ideas in draft blog posts. Sometimes I just jot down a title and other times it’s a jumble of ideas. Then I’ll go back the next day or in a few days to complete the content and edit the post. At any given time I’m working on 3 or 4 drafts. I might hold onto a draft/idea for a month or two to let it mature a bit so I can better express it or gather examples. After a few weeks of practicing storing and retaining ideas becomes part of a daily routine. Nevertheless some days I feel like I’m wading through mud to write a few paragraphs. Voice Blog readers respond to strong individual voices. A blog shouldn’t resemble the Economist or the New Yorker whose editorial teams use style guides to ensure a consistent tone which is larger than any individual writer. The whole point of a blog is to hear a real human voice. It’s something I forget sometimes so I try to write the first draft the way I might speak and edit that output. Hemingway is my inspiration for human tone. Titles Titles matter. I spend lots of time on my titles but I didn’t always which was a big mistake. Looking back through the first year or so of my blog titles I can see now they were awful. Here’s an early one: “Binary pointillism - the intersection of Seurat and Felton.” Barf. Who wants to read that? It sounds like a dissertation. Dan Shipper taught me the best titles read like tweets. My goal is to drive as many retweets as possible so I shouldn’t ask the user to construct an interesting tweet on my behalf. Instead I should make it easy for the reader to just hit a button and share something interesting. I often write the title as the last step. It’s easier after having written the conclusion to summarize the point in 140 characters or fewer. Distribution Once I post I tweet the post submit the post to Quibb and Hacker News. Then I monitor the reactions. If after 45 minutes I don’t see many retweets or much engagement I’ll try another title or two. Sometimes the post is to blame but more often I haven’t allured the reader with the right title. One blogger recommended ignoring the Google Analytics and Feedburner stats to me. I find that it helps quite a bit not to be so metrics focused. Then I’m not so concerned about the daily fluctuations but more on monthly stats which is a better indicator of success. Nevertheless I still haven’t figured out how best way to measure the success of this blog. Patience Honestly it takes forever to build a blog that people know or read about or care about. For some the reader base grows much much quicker than it did for me. Nevertheless building any kind of brand on the web through content or otherwise is a slow incremental process. Every once in a while I’ll reach the front page of Hacker News or spike on LinkedIn and I get an increase in readership. But it takes patience. I find the more content I have produced the more the blog pays dividends. Most of my posts are evergreen timeless so they appear in Google searches or are randomly resurrected in social media from time to time rediscovered through some stroke of luck. Ultimately blogging helps me refine my thinking and share it with people who are interested or curious. I hope this post helps motivate you to write. h/t to Stefano Bernardi @stefanobernardi who inspired this post. Published 2013-04-03,Published 2013-04-03
http://tomtunguz.com/one-on-ones/,Startup Best Practices 9 - Structuring One on Ones to Maximize Your Team's Success,Startup Best Practices 9 - Structuring One on Ones to Maximize Your Team's Success The startups that build and retain the best teams develop a huge competitive advantage. It’s no surprise that managers are the most important influencers of team development and retention. The most frequent and consequently most powerful tool for managers to coach develop and lead their teams are one-on-ones weekly meetings between a manager and his or her individual reports. Most one-on-ones are ad-hoc loosely structured 15-30 minute meetings. While extemporaneous meetings can work leaders who manage their teams this way forgo an important opportunity to further their team’s success. So how does a manager run excellent one-on-ones? In How Google Works Eric Schmidt and Jonathan Rosenberg former-CEO and SVP of Products at Google articulate the structure for one-on-one meetings prescribed to Google by the legendary mentor Bill Campbell) who has advised Steve Jobs Scott Cook and many other pioneers including a few Redpoint founding teams. There are two parts to Bill Campbell’s one-on-one structure: a list compiled before the meeting and a format for the meeting. Before each meeting both the manager and the report should write down the five things each want to cover in the meeting. At the start of the meeting they should compare lists and they should find significant overlap. This initial step confirms both people are prioritizing the same tasks. If the lists diverge meaningfully it’s time for the manager to reassess coalesce and articulate the priorities of the team. After running through those five to seven line items Campbell suggests structuring the meeting in four sections: Performance on job requirements: This is the time to review sales figures product milestones customer satisfaction budget numbers etc. Relationships with peer groups: As a startup grows cross-team collaboration becomes increasingly important to achieving milestones. Discussing the state of these relationships can expose limiting factors in the team’s success places where a manager can exert influence to dissolve roadblocks. Leadership: Growth learning and self-actualization are keys to employee happiness and success. A fraction of the 1 ⁄1 should be focused on helping a report develop those skills which include mentoring other teammates hiring and firing and team motivation. Innovation: This is the time during the 1 ⁄1 to make sure the teammate is continually thinking ahead asking hard questions of the team and the business and surfacing novel trends/technologies/best practices from outside the team. Terrific managers and team leaders alter the trajectory of their startups by inspiring enabling and empowering their teams to achieve audacious goals. Great management is a discipline a daily practice of small things like a well-structured 1 ⁄1 that when summed across years of collaboration create dramatic and sweeping change.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-ipo-performance/,The Health of the SaaS IPO Market,The Health of the SaaS IPO Market Of the 43 SaaS companies to have gone public in the time period between 2006 and 2014 60% are trading above their IPO pop price – the price at the end of their first day of trading. The median company has appreciated 69% since its IPO. The chart above shows the trends for each of the companies in this data set. Xero tops the list that more than 17x appreciation. This is an anomaly; the company went public right as it was founded and has grown to be worth several billion dollars. It’s an amazing story. On the bottom end Castlight has dropped by 80 percentage points in value since its IPO to a market cap of about $850 million and trades below the typical SaaS company at about 7x forward revenues. If you’re curious about the trends from IPO offer you can find the chart here. In contrast to the balanced historical stock performance when all of these companies went out for the IPO there was broad excitement about them. The chart above shows the IPO pop the change in share price from offering to first day trading close. Almost every stock all except three saw some appreciation. The average company’s market capitalization grew by 32%. The data indicates that despite relatively broad excitement for SaaS companies at IPO eventually the market discerns the differences in the revenue models go to markets and attractiveness of different businesses. Looking at the IPO cohorts we can see that the vast majority of companies have appreciated from their offer price. Here is a zoomed in version Even recent IPOs some of which have faced skepticism trade above offer. The data also shows that over time companies appreciate more as their revenues grow. This is a very natural trend. But these companies have also had to fight multiple compression in the market. In 2014 revenue multiples fell by 30% meaning any share price appreciation had to overcome this decline. Overall the data tells a heartening story. There is quite a bit of excitement for new software companies in the public markets. But that enthusiasm isn’t blind. Public market investors are able to distinguish exceptional businesses from not so exceptional businesses. This judgment is healthy. It indicates the market that isn’t blindly investing in B2B technology companies. Rather public market investors are pricing each based on the characteristics of the business’s prospects.

http://tomtunguz.com/groves-stagger-chart/,Startup Best Practices 7 - How to Use Andy Grove's Stagger Chart to Build Predictability into a Startup,Startup Best Practices 7 - How to Use Andy Grove's Stagger Chart to Build Predictability into a Startup Predictability is sexy. Startups that have tuned their growth engines well enough to accurately forecast their growth presuming these growth rates are attractive will command much higher valuations in the market simply because there is less risk in the company. As a result investors prize these companies disproportionately. The challenge with predictability is predictability isn’t an end state. A business doesn’t become predictable one day and remain in that state in perpetuity. Rather predictability is a discipline that must be practiced by managers and management teams within startups. Further complicating things predictability is a product of many different teams’ efforts. Engineering and product teams set goals and deliver products on time. Marketing teams seek to generate sufficient marketing qualified leads (MQLs) to enable sales teams to achieve their sales quotas. Human resources must create a process to hire the right people when the business needs them. As Peter Drucker said “you can’t manage what you can’t measure.” The same is true for predictability. Andy Grove the former President of Intel and author of one of my favorite management books wrote about a technique for measuring predictability in his book High Output Management called the Stagger Chart. I’ve produced a hypothetical stagger chart for a fictional SaaS company’s revenue above. Along the horizontal axis is the forecast for each month. Along the vertical axis are the months in which a forecast was made. Making this a bit more tangible the second line the February line with the numbers 36* 41 47 60 and 75 is the four month forecast made in February. In February the company generated $36k in revenue and the management team predicted $41k in March revenue $47M in April revenue and so on. This chart tells the reader three things: The actual revenue growth for the business. The numbers in red with asterisks are actual figures. Looking down a column tells the reader how the forecasts for a particular month have changed with time. For example March’s forecasts became stronger with time. June on the other hand fell with time. When the forecasts fall out of line as they have in June something is wrong or some key expectation hasn’t borne out and the team should investigate the cause for the deviation. These types of charts can be applied to most activities of a startup including sales dollars new customers marketing leads hires churn….the list goes on. By asking for predictions and then retrospectively evaluating the predictions and how they change with time management can ingrain more predictability into the business and also develop a toolkit to find some of the leading indicators of changes within the business.

http://tomtunguz.com/location-impact-ma/,The Impact of a Startup's Location on its Acquisition Potential,The Impact of a Startup's Location on its Acquisition Potential Does a startup’s location impact its M&A prospects? We’ve already determined there is no material difference between the follow-on financing rates by geography. But do acquirers behave similarly to investors? To answer the question I’ve prepared three charts used Crunchbase data and focused on the seven states with more than 20 acquisitions since 2010. In the first two charts we’ll compare the share of acquisitions by state to the share of financings by state in both number and dollar value to get a sense of relative performance by state. The third chart shows the distribution of acquisitions by state. The chart at the top of the post plots the share by state of number of acquisitions and financings. Californian startups raise 53% of the rounds in this subset of state but see 60% of the acquisitions. It’s the only state to see a higher ratio of acquisitions than financings although the difference is slight. When looking at share by dollars the story is a bit more skewed. Californian startup raise 49% of all the dollars among these seven states but command 68% of the M&A dollars. NY startups see a very different pattern raising 26% of the venture dollars and receiving 6.5% of the acquisition dollars. The Californian figures are much different than the rest of the country for a few reasons. First a small number of very large acquisitions like WhatsApp skew the numbers. Power laws seem to govern startups and these figures are subject to that influence. Second there is an important timing difference between the financings and acquisitions. In other words the analysis doesn’t track whether the startups of 2010 become acquired a few years later; I’m simply adding the up the financing dollars and adding up the acquisition dollars and making a comparison. The New York startup scene has boomed in the last five or so years but since the average time to acquisition for a startup is around seven this latency disproportionately impacts relatively new startup states. The last and most telling chart shows the distribution of M&A outcomes by state. There is no statistically significant difference between the acquisition prices across any of these states to better than 95% confidence. In other words like the financing market the acquisition market is highly efficient - great companies fetch terrific prices in each of these seven states. Published 2014-08-25,Published 2014-08-25
http://tomtunguz.com/state-of-public-tech/,The Insularity of Silicon Valley,The Insularity of Silicon Valley Earlier this week the Commerce Department announced US GDP in Q1 2014 fell by 3% the most in a quarter since the recession. I’ve linked to the WSJ’s chart depicting the trend above. The decline was 3x greater than forecasted. Silicon Valley seems unfazed. As I wrote about earlier this year we’ve seen a decline in the public markets of about 25% in consumer stocks and 45% in enterprise stocks. But since that time public tech companies have witnessed a small recovery. Both enterprise and consumer companies are up 18% from their 10 month lows. Below are two charts showing the “average” consumer and enterprise tech company’s share price progressing over time compared to their share price 10 months ago. A value of zero means the stock is at the same price as ten months ago. A value of 10 means the stock is 10% higher than 10 months ago. Consumer has been impacted a bit more than enterprise but on the whole both categories of companies are increasing in value again despite the broader economic challenges in Q1. And forward revenue to enterprise value multiples are on the rise again. As of today the mean next-twelve months to enterprise value multiple is 7.5 up from 5.5 in May. The businesses created in Startupland are real companies generating meaningful revenue growing quickly and changing industries. Despite large institutional investors cycling out of growth stocks and into value stocks which caused the April decline in many names tech is booming and as a result seems to be insulated from the broader economy. If you’re curious about the movements of individual names over the past tens months the share prices for the roughly 50 companies across both baskets are below.

http://tomtunguz.com/aspirations/,Learning from Amazon’s Startup Judo,Learning from Amazon’s Startup Judo This week Amazon made public its advertising initiatives. Given the massive trove of invaluable purchasing data Amazon collects I’m certain Amazon could build a rival to AdSense. But they aren’t. Below is a quote from an interview with Lisa Utzschneider the head of Amazon Media Group: Q: Can you give us a sense of how important advertising is to Amazon? A: I think the way Jeff [Bezos] would answer that is if we think about Amazon in two worlds one world is an Amazon with ads and lower prices. Another world is an Amazon with no ads and higher prices. Which one would we choose? I think nine times out of 10 or 10 times out of 10 we would take Amazon with ads and lower prices. In other words Amazon doesn’t view advertising as an adjacent business to their eCommerce business. Or even a standalone business. It would be easy for Bezos to juice the single-digit margins of the ecommerce business with the much 30 to 40% margin revenue from the Media Group to appeal to Wall Street and boost the stock price in the short term. Instead Bezos is staking a much longer term and bigger bet: the Media Group will become a growth engine for the eCommerce business. Amazon will use ads to reduce prices shifting the supply/demand curve and shipping more products. Customers are happier because the prices on Amazon are the lowest on the web. Advertisers are happy because Amazon sells more of their products and benefit from consumer purchasing data. Meanwhile someone else’s marketing dollars are fueling Amazon’s business both eCommerce market share and consumer purchasing data. This cycle reinforces Amazon’s strengths and ultimately dominance. Bezos truly is a master of startup judo. He is leveraging other company’s strengths to grow his own business. Published 2012-10-09,Published 2012-10-09

A digital tragedy of the commons each additional mobile application a user downloads decreases the odds of an average application re-engaging a user. After all the time spent on mobile isn’t increasing fast enough to cover the marginal application. Developers have used push notifications effectively to re-engage users but push overload drives more and more users to opt out of push. Because of this app over-population and the tremendous reach many mobile developers have mobile advertising spend will shift from new customer acquisition to re-engagement. The mobile cost-per-install market is measured in the billions. But the mobile re-engagement market will be measured in the tens of billions. After all most of the internet ad spend is on re-engagment. The largest internet ad spend categories retail financial telecom auto and travel all spend extensively on re-engagement. The growth of Criteo a retargeting company is just a small indicator of the size of the re-engagement ad market. Search Google for a flight from San Francisco to Las Vegas and you’ll see a re-engagement ad. This shift hasn’t gone unnoticed. Facebook launched Reengagement Ads. Google is also forging ahead with deep linking for mobile app re-engagement. Startups will of course forge innovative paths to market and unlock new opportunities. Ultimately the mobile app ecosystem will experience the same tectonic shift from a directory of applications both in the App Store and on the device to intent driven discovery - a parallel shift from Yahoo’s directory to Google’s search search ads and content ads on the web. Fortunes will be made in the process. Published 2013-11-21,Published 2013-11-21
http://tomtunguz.com/composition-1b-club/,The Key Financing Attributes of Startups in the Billion Dollar Club,The Key Financing Attributes of Startups in the Billion Dollar Club The WSJ published a recent chart of the 49 startups with billion dollar valuations. According to their research there have never been as many privately held companies with such high valuations ever. The absolute number of these massively valuable companies alone is amazing. Ten years ago most of them would have gone public by now. But what other insights can we tease from the data about these very special businesses? First the Billion Dollar Club (BDC) is nearly evenly split between Consumer and Enterprise companies as the table below shows. I’ve noted the median dollars raised the median valuation and the valuation efficiency in the table. The valuation efficiency is the valuation divided by the capital raised. This metric tries to answer the question how much capital did the startup need to raise to achieve that valuation? This is a somewhat flawed metric[1] but I’m going to use it to compare the relative attractiveness of sectors[2]. Sector Median Raised $M Median Valuation $B Valuation Efficiency Count Consumer 350 2.0 5.7 29 Enterprise 219 1.2 5.5 24 Healthcare 450 1.5 3.2 2 Other 290 2.9 10.0 3 Despite similar representation in the BDC the median valuation of a consumer company is 67% higher than that of an enterprise company. In fact 60% of enterprise companies in the group have valuations below $2.5B as the frequency chart below shows. On the other hand consumer companies command substantially higher valuations due to faster growth rates and greater revenue opportunities. Next let's investigate the Consumer and Enterprise components a bit deeper. I've categorized each of the companies in the data set by hand into subsectors and run the same analysis as above to surface material differences across sub sectors. Subsector Median Raised $M Median Valuation $B Valuation Effiency Count Consumer Services 514 1.6 3.1 10 Ecommerce 300 2.0 6.7 11 Hardware 441 6.7 15.1 2 Social Media 267 3.1 11.4 4 I categorized consumer companies into four buckets: Consumer Services (e.g. Spotify Evernote Airbnb) ECommerce (JustFab Fab Gilt) Hardware (Jawbone Xiaomi) and Social Media (e.g. Snapchat Pinterest) Consumer services and Ecommerce constitute the bulk of the Consumer BDC. But the real story are the social media companies who raise substantially less capital to achieve the second highest valuations. Again this is a result of the fast growth rates massive user bases and huge monetization opportunities in this segment. The hardware category's median valuation is heavily influenced by Xiaomi a super-fast growing Chinese mobile phone company whose last valuation pegged the company at $10B. Subsector Median Raised $M Median Valuation $B Valuation Effiency Count Big Data 900 4.1 4.6 3 Financial Services 160 3.8 24.6 3 Infrastructure 231 1.2 5.2 3 SaaS 206 1.1 5.3 10 Security 470 1.0 2.2 3 Storage 339 2.1 6.1 2 Let's analyze the enterprise data similarly broken down into these categories: Big Data (e.g. Cloudera HortonWorks) Financial Services (e.g. Stripe Square) Infrastructure (e.g. MongoDB Nutanix) Saas (e.g. NewRelic InsideSales) Security (e.g. Good Technology CloudFlare) and Storage (e.g. Pure Storage). Big Data companies have raised more capital on median than any other category by at least 2x. Cloudera skews this figure but it's indicative of the capital requirements to sell products in this very competitive market. The Financial Services companies Stripe and Square record high valuation efficiencies likely because their customer acquisition strategies are developer and SMB focused which excises the high cost of enterprise sales and positions them more for consumer-like customer acquisition. Company Raised $M Valuation $B Number of Rounds Valuation Efficiency Snapchat 150 10 3 67 SpaceX 115 4.8 4 41 Xiaomi 350 10 4 29 LendingClub 155 3.8 6 25 I was curious which companies recorded the highest valuation efficiencies. The table above lists the top four. Interestingly these companies all serve different markets: Consumer Services space travel (Other) Hardware Financial Services. This indicates to me that it’s possible to create massive businesses in many different categories. It’s fascinating to look at the paths created by the members of the Billion Dollar Club if nothing else but to inspire us to what we could achieve. [1]The valuation efficiency metric is flawed for many reasons. First it makes assumptions about why startups raise capital. Second it assumes that all valuation to revenue multiples are similar (which is not true). Third it catches companies at different points in their growth trajectories. A better metric would be venture dollars required to achieve a certain level of gross profit. But we don’t have that data so I’ll use this as a low-grade proxy.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-innovators-solution/,The Innovator's Solution for SaaS Startups - The Flywheel SaaS Company,The Innovator's Solution for SaaS Startups - The Flywheel SaaS Company In the Innovator’s Dilemma for SaaS Startups I outlined the path of many software companies which disrupt incumbents by first serving the small-to-medium business and then move up-market by transitioning to serve larger enterprises with outbound sales teams. I argued this transition is largely due to the more attractive characteristics of larger customers namely higher sales efficiency and reduced churn rates. This is the “traditional” way of disrupting. But as Kenny van Zant of Asana and Mike Cannon-Brookes of Atlassian told me there’s another way a novel way of building companies that still isn’t very well understood: the Flywheel SaaS Company. The pyramid above describes the Traditional Model. A startup initially targets the SMB segment develops a product to suit those customers and uses marketing to acquire large numbers of them. Eventually the product improves mid-market customers come calling and the new inside sales team closes those customers which are primarily inbound leads. At some point in the future the company decides it’s time to pursue enterprise accounts and hires an enterprise team. Those sales people are primarily outbound sourcing marketing and creating their own customer accounts. Most of the time this enterprise sales effort operates independently of the existing marketing/inside sales effort. The Flywheel Model differs from the Traditional Model in one fundamental regard. The enterprise sales team is exclusively inbound. They are explicitly denied the option of seeking business outside the customer base and must gin up business from only existing customers. The enterprise sales team is an up-sell and cross-sell team. In fact so is the mid-market sales team. Only the SMB marketing team is permitted to acquire new leads. In short the Flywheel flips the traditional idea of enterprise people as hunters and others as farmers. The marketing engine spins a customer acquisition flywheel that captures all kinds of customers both big and small. Some of these customers are true small businesses; others are teams or departments in companies. Over time the product spreads from team to team and department to department increasing customer size and revenue to the startup. It’s the responsibility of the mid-market and enterprise teams to find cultivate and upsell these growing accounts. Atlassian has mastered this method and achieved terrific success recording $215M in revenue growing 44% in 2014. The chart above shows the company’s revenue growth since its founding in 2002 according to press reports. The company famously touts that it has grown without sales reps precisely because its mid-market and enterprise teams farm exclusively within the pool created by the company’s marketing engine. The up-sell conversation is a very easy one: “Mr. CXO there’s no need for a trial or feature comparison. 25% of your employees are already using our product.” What better argument for success is there than internal social proof? Flywheel models have a simple beauty about them. The entire company is focused on the same thing: building the momentum in one main customer acquisition mechanism. Additionally this flywheel model is incredibly capital efficient. Atlassian raised its first venture round of $60M after being in business for 8 years and growing to $59M in revenue. In SaaS the Traditional approach and the Flywheel approach both have led to the creation of some astounding companies. But sometimes one model is better than another. Flywheel models work very well in sectors where the ultimate buyer has is very difficult to sell or market to (e.g. product managers and engineers). The high customer acquisition costs of these customer types are driven by their software evaluation and product purchasing behaviors which differ from the norm. These customer segments often prefer educating themselves than relying on a salesperson. Engineers don’t buy software the way marketers do. In addition Flywheel models work in markets where products can expand from any part within the continuum of SMBs to enterprise. A deployment can start with an individual a team a group or the whole company and be successful. In contrast ERP software isn’t a flywheel business. Individuals don’t deploy ERP for themselves or their teams. ERP is monolithic company wide software that is a top-down decision for larger businesses. Last Flywheel models may not work as well when an industry has intense competition already pursuing a Traditional model. Relying on customers to self-educate or awaiting products to percolate throughout an organization to grow customer accounts requires patience and time. Sometimes top down sales may trump the bottoms up sales. However if a Flywheel company’s product is significantly better it can rally internal sentiment as a powerful sales tool during a bake-off between competing vendors. I believe very strongly that there are many different ways of building a business. I also believe we’re going to see more and more Flywheel SaaS companies in the future. It’s an elegant model to build a company and I’m very grateful that Kenny helped me understand them better and let me recreate the drawings he used to describe this model to me.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-value-of-startup-research/,You want to start a company. Now what?,You want to start a company. Now what? Last week a close friend who is a product manager/designer told me he’s starting a company. He asked me where I thought the biggest opportunity lay given his skills and his passions. He’s incredibly capable and driven but he hasn’t yet found the right place to apply his energy. My friend is in search of a problem to solve. He’s in the right place. After all: “The essence of a startup lies in the process of discovering a problem shared by many people and trying to solve it.”. So how does a founder discover these problems? Research. I suggested to him that he should pretend to be a sociologist study the way that employees of medium sized companies work. Which software they use which processes they perform how they collaborate. Most people love to share their gripes frustrations and pains with a receptive listener. Aggregating this feedback over a set of interviews will provide him (i) some insight into common pain points across positions rank and company (ii) an idea of which problems excite him (iii) and generate new ideas for his startup. In short these interviews help him collect define and narrow the problem he’s most excited about solving. (Also this research will help him understand his target market](http://tomasztunguz.com/2012/05/15/how-to-pick-your-startups-market/). Of course in his research he may discover a secret or an angle a proprietary insight that would catapult his startup into the market. But the only way to find this secret is to get into the field and start researching. Published 2012-10-26,Published 2012-10-26
http://tomtunguz.com/rising-costs-of-startups/,The Rising Costs of Scaling a Startup,The Rising Costs of Scaling a Startup It’s becoming more and more expensive to scale a startup in San Francisco. In fact it’s twice as costly to operate a startup in 2014 as it was in 2009. According to data from Jones Lang LaSalle office prices in San Francisco have nearly doubled in five years from $36 per square foot per year to $63. Typically businesses allocate about 150 square feet of office space per employee. Given the market rate for office space and annual salaries hypothetical 20 person Series A startup will spend about $200k per year per employee in 2015. In parallel startups and incumbents vying for talent in the increasingly competitive job market have bid up the median wage of a San Francisco technology worker 15% each year from about $90k to well over to $180k in 2014. Wages include salary benefits stock options and perks. Wages constitute the majority of the increase in startup expenses. Real estate costs add only 5% of per employee costs. The combined inflation of real estate and wage costs have a dramatic impact of the operating expenses of startups. The chart above compares the op-ex (excluding marketing spend) of a hypothetical 20 person Series A startup and a hypothetical 80 person Series B startup over the past five years. In both cases the op-ex figures double from $2.5M to $5.0M and from $7.9M to $15.6M respectively. The cost savings startups achieve from cloud computing infrastructure or other technology cost reductions are dwarfed by the steady cost increases of labor in particular. These heightened costs of doing business may explain some of the increase in startup round sizes. Of course 2014 was the best year for venture fundraising in more than a decade and more venture dollars pursuing more startup opportunities in the Bay Area means even greater demand for top talent. It’s quite likely that the substantial injection of venture dollars into the ecosystem are creating the market dynamics that increase startup costs. Consequently it’s not unreasonable to expect wage inflation and consequently higher startup operating costs to continue. Published 2015-02-10,Published 2015-02-10
http://tomtunguz.com/my-approach-to-building-a-hiring-pipeline/,My approach to building a hiring pipeline,My approach to building a hiring pipeline Over the last few months I’ve been helping a few companies build hiring pipelines to recruit at nearly every experience level and for technical sales and business development roles. Below are the lessons I’ve learned. Identify your ideal candidate If you don’t know where you’re going any road will take you there. Narrow your search focus to find the right candidate. The easiest way to start is by building look-alike candidate lists. I start with either a particular person or a list of companies that would provide someone with the right experience for the role. Right tools. Right mentality. Hiring is a daily process. You should treat it like email - something you do every day. Allocate an hour per day to search and contact potential candidates. Allocate up to 50% of your time to interview reference and close candidates. Get your technology in place. Upgrade to a premium LinkedIn account. Deploy an applicant tracking system. It can be as simple as Google Docs or Streak. Candidate tracking is essential for success both for communication with candidates but also within your team. Nail your pitch Hiring is sales. Be human in introductory emails. Find a way to relate someone or something about the role to the person you’re contacting. It could be a contact in common shared work experiences or shared passions. Say something that will intrigue someone to learn just a bit more. The goal of the email is to generate curiosity and land the first meeting. That’s it. Perfect the process Be responsive. Quick email responses. Quick interview scheduling. Quick decisions. Reference strong prospects in parallel. Immediately after the first meeting I start contacting former colleagues and co-workers to get another data point before the second interview. Sell the dream You started a company. You should be passionate about it and the opportunity to build something worthwhile. During the process your goal should be to understand the candidates dreams. Sell the candidate by telling them how your dreams converge. Published 2012-10-03,Published 2012-10-03
http://tomtunguz.com/cost-of-bad-data-1-10-100/,The Cost of Bad Data is the Illusion of Knowledge,The Cost of Bad Data is the Illusion of Knowledge Each time I open Salesforce in my browser I think of Stephen Hawking. It’s because of an aphorism an entrepreneur shared with me a few weeks ago. He said: The cost to fix a data error at the time of entry is $1. The cost to fix it an hour after it’s been entered is $10. And the cost to fix it several months later is $100+. Take for example a venture capitalist’s CRM tool. If I mistype an email address or the details of the last fund raise it might cost me a minute or two to fix it at that very moment. A minute of time is worth about $1. If I’m lazy and don’t correct the error later on that day one of my colleagues might search our CRM for the company and comes across the erroneous record which he suspects is inaccurate. First he will check his notes then he will call me to verify and then he will change the record. The rigamarole has undermined his trust of my data and the ten minutes he spent correcting my data entry are wasted. Worst of all is if I contact a startup to inquire about an upcoming fund raise with incorrect data. As a result I could miss an opportunity to partner with a great company because of incorrect timing or lose credibility with the startup’s executive team. The cost to the firm could be in the tens of millions of dollars. All because I was lazy updating the CRM record. Data promises compounding returns. The more data you have on a customer or prospect or your own business the better the insights you can draw and the better decisions you can make. But these returns are blind to the quality of data. Bad data has equally great compounding effects.

http://tomtunguz.com/seed-followon-rates/,The Minimum Size Seed Round to Maximize Series A Follow On Investment,The Minimum Size Seed Round to Maximize Series A Follow On Investment How large of a seed round should founders raise to maximize their chances of raising a Series A? Smaller seed rounds are simpler and faster to raise because they typically require fewer investors. They may also require less dilution because of the smaller investment size. On the other hand to raise a Series A the startup needs enough runway to hire a team and prove certain milestones to Series A investors. Using Crunchbase data from 2005 to 2012 I’ve plotted the follow-on rates by size of seed investment quintiles across 2906 companies in that period. Startups who raised $300k or less in their seed raised Series As about 12% of the time. Founders who raised between $300k and $600k doubled their odds of raising an A to better than 24% and those who raised between $600k and $900k increased the probability an additional 50% reaching 33%. After that point the marginal capital demonstrates diminishing returns. The data indicates that larger seed rounds substantially increase the odds of raising a Series A. This could be due to a number of reasons. First founders with larger seed rounds benefit from more time to establish product market fit. Second the additional capital enables seed stage startups to be more aggressive ramping the business either through marketing efforts recruiting efforts or other tactics. Third larger seed rounds likely have one or two institutional investors who have invested the substantial majority of the round and given their larger fund sizes are willing and able to lead the Series A. More runway implies better odds of success. Published 2014-02-06,Published 2014-02-06
http://tomtunguz.com/followon-by-geo/,The Impact of a Startup's Location on Its Ability to Raise Capital,The Impact of a Startup's Location on Its Ability to Raise Capital Great entrepreneurs can come from anywhere. But do the locations of startups affect their ability to raise follow on capital? Do seed stage companies in the Bay Area face lower likelihoods of raising a Series A because of more competition? Or is it that New York based startups because of a smaller ecosystem face more difficulty? Using Crunchbase data I charted the financing follow-on rates across the 12 US cities in which at least 10 seeds 3 Series As and 3 Series Bs have occured in the Crunchbase data set from 2005-2014. The first two charts below contrast the success rates of post-seed startups raising an A having raised a seed and raising a B having raised an A. The third chart shows the success rates of raising a B having raised a seed round. A startup’s headquarters location seems to have no impact on the company’s ability to raise a Series A. Though there are variances between the low of Washington DC (11%) and the high of Seattle (29%) the differences aren’t statistically significant. In the Series B market Pittburgh and Houston are two outliers where 100% of the recorded Series As raised Bs. Of course the total number of companies in each case is small only 3. Setting aside those aberrations again the differences between the markets aren’t statistically significant. These statistics don’t reveal any information about the difficulty of these follow-on rounds or the terms of those rounds or the time required to raise those rounds. But they do show the fund raising market is relatively efficient. Despite the concentrations of capital sources in places like Sand Hill Road and the Flat Iron District investors are willing to board planes to seek out and underwrite investments in great companies no matter where in the country they may be.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-revenue-growth-rates/,The Increasing Growth Rates of SaaS Companies,The Increasing Growth Rates of SaaS Companies SaaS startups are growing faster than ever before. Publicly-traded SaaS companies founded from 2008 through 2014 needed 50% less time to reach $50M than their counterparts founded between 1998 and 2005. I stumbled across this trend when looking at a different chart used in my S-1 analyses that compares the time to $50M for each of the 51 or so publicly traded SaaS companies. I’ve colored the companies founded in the last ten years in red. Newer SaaS companies grow faster. 82% of the companies to achieve $50M in revenue in under 8 years have been founded in the last decade. Meanwhile all of the companies requiring longer than 8 years were founded before 2004. SaaS companies and enterprise companies broadly are growing faster than ever before. And they are doing it every stage. This chart plots the median revenue of the basket of publicly traded companies by founding date. The curve of every subsequent cohort is steeper and the time to reach certain milestones is shorter. SaaS companies are growing faster at every step in their path. These faster revenue growth rates are the most important contributor to the increasing valuations in the fundraising market. While the increasing supply of venture dollars may enable larger cash requirements for faster growing companies to fuel their growth the data shows that newer SaaS companies can be far more efficient growth engines than their forbears. SaaS companies are growing faster and more efficiently than ever before. The new sales model of acquiring customers with B2C2B techniques by attracting end users through app stores self sign up and open source software combined with high velocity inside sales teams has created an enormously attractive growth engine that will catapult SaaS companies to dominate every existing category of software and many new segments yet to be created.

http://tomtunguz.com/controlling-your-destiny/,How to Grow Huge: Proprietary Distribution Channels,How to Grow Huge: Proprietary Distribution Channels Sam Altman argues in How to Grow Huge that the only way for a startup to grow really large is to create products that people love and promote. As the user base grows users attract ever larger numbers of users to the product producing compounding growth. The point is a terrific one and I think it can be generalized. To grow really large startups have to create proprietary distribution channels. The one Sam champions word of mouth marketing intrinsic to a strong brand is one example of a proprietary distribution channel. Other examples include Dropbox’s referral mechanism Hubspot’s blog (the 490th most-trafficked site in the US) GitHub and Cyanogen Mod’s community and GroupOn’s email list of 150M+ addresses. In each of these cases the startup owns the distribution channel. Sometimes the channel is integrated in the product (Dropbox) sometimes the channel is adjacent (HubSpot Cyanogen). In either case no competitor can touch it. Challengers may try to replicate the success of the distribution channel by copying it but cannot compete within the channel which means it’s an incredibly cost-effective channel for its owner. Contrast these proprietary distribution channels with hyper-efficient and competitive online ad markets both SEM and display SEO rankings and open platforms like the iOS and Android and Salesforce and Intuit and other online app stores. These are open markets with lots of competition which enforce efficient pricing and reduce margins. It’s a boxing match with every entrant taking their fair share of punches. Sometimes startups begin in the open market and having achieved some scale foster their own channels. Zynga and Kabam grew to some scale on Facebook’s traffic hose before both deciding to move to their own platforms. AirBnB drafted on Craigslist’s listing velocity to engender enough liquidity of their own. YouTube and MySpace is the same story. Ultimately each of these success stories built their own user acquisition channels. Sam is absolutely right. The only way to grow really large is to build and control proprietary distribution channels. It’s a huge strategic imperative for startups reaching scale. Published 2013-12-04,Published 2013-12-04
http://tomtunguz.com/founders-with-cs/,Dream Teams: The Characteristics of Billion-Dollar Startup Founders,Dream Teams: The Characteristics of Billion-Dollar Startup Founders There’s a perpetual and roaring debate in Startupland about the ideal founding team. Should the ideal team be entirely computer scientists? How important to success is having an MBA/business person? What about the stories of billionaire dropouts? To answer that question I’ve aggregated the academic backgrounds of 30 of the top startups of the past few years and analyzed the make up of each of those founding teams. Above is a chart comparing the number of “billion” dollar startups by the total number of founders and the share of technical founders. The full dataset is here. Here are the key observations of this data: The average founding team has 2.4 founders; the median is 2 70% of teams have at least one technical founder 40% of teams are exclusively computer scientists 30% of teams have no technical cofounders 15% of founders have dropped out of an undergraduate or graduate degree program 10% of founders have an MBA The sample size here is small only 30 and by definition each one of these companies is an exception. But a few patterns emerge from the data. First there is no clear correlation between the fraction of technical founders and the ultimate success of the business. In this data set there are an equal number of successful non-technical teams as technical teams as semi-technical teams. The share is split a third to each. Second there are as many dropouts as MBAs among these teams which asks more questions about education than it answers. Third looking through the data there is a slight bias towards technical teams in enterprise companies particularly where technology is the main differentiator. No surprise there. But in the consumer world and in software as a service there seems to be no patterns. For every Pinterest there’s an Uber; for every Box.net there’s a Workday. The data confirmed what I believe: great founding teams can come from anywhere. Published 2013-10-28,Published 2013-10-28

Plus cohort analysis provides a framework to evaluate product releases marketing pushes and advertising campaign performance. The Six Cohort Reports I Use to Understand Trends Below is a list of the six reports I create when analyzing cohorts. The combination of these six reports provides a robust summary of the state of a customer base. By no means exhaustive this collection is a solid starting point and of course these are framed in the context of revenue but could easily be changed to activity or another metric. Average Revenue Per Customer Over Time - Chart monthly revenue over time to contrast with cohort data Individual Account Growth Over Time - Chart all accounts to visualize trends. Typical Account Growth Over Time - Chart how the average account grows with time Number of Customers in Each Cohort - Chart number of customers in each cohort to see how sensitive cohort data is to sample size and also see the size of the new customer pipeline over time. Average Monthly Revenue By Cohort - Chart the revenue by cohort to see if newer customers generate more or less revenue than older customers. Really good for marketing spend evaluation. Cohort Comparison - Chart the different cohorts over time to see how their revenue characteristics compare. Implementation in R Cohort analysis is difficult to perform in a database or in Excel so I turned to R. Below is a generic cohort analysis script for R the open source statistical language. I use two libraries by Hadley Wickham plyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for plotting the data. Hadley is at the forefront of R and an extraordinary contributor to the community. I can’t overstate his impact on the way I use R. I seem to use only standard libraries and Hadley’s. To use this data analysis start with a file with 3 columns: “date” column (YYYY-MM-DD) “company_name” column monthly revenue “revenue”. If your file isn’t in this format use Hadley’s reshape library to “melt” the data. Note: I use tab-separated files but you could easily use a CSV.

http://tomtunguz.com/data-science-personas/,Why Personas Are Critical Product Development and Go To Market Tools for Startups,Why Personas Are Critical Product Development and Go To Market Tools for Startups Yesterday I attended an event held by the IT team of a major bank. When the data analytics team took the stage I listened with great interest as the chief of the group described their internal struggles with data and the areas where startups might help them achieve their goals. He articulated his team’s needs and goals in a very concise way by bucketing his users into three personas. I’ve summarized these personas below: The Three People That Matter in Data Role Challenges Technology Analyst Reveal trends in data Create and propagate data silos Visualization tools Spreadsheets BI Scientist Create models to describe behavior predict the future and expose anomalies employing advanced statistics. Spend a huge amount of time manipulating data into an analyzable form Statistical Packages for modeling ETL tools Scrubbing and Validation Tools Steward Ensuring the data infrastructure meets the teams needs and complies with company/industry policy Supply the proper infrastructure to met the needs of the data team manage legal risk and document data. Master Data Management Data Lineage Access Control and Rights Administration Provisioning This talk reminded me of the notion of personas from my product manager days. Personas are incredibly effective tools for product managers to employ. Personas focus the product roadmap on important issues and guide product design. By focusing the team on particular needs personas ensure that all the major stakeholders’ needs are addressed. For example I’d never heard the term data steward before. The term data steward was coined in 2007 but the term hasn’t seen nearly the level of adoption garnered by data scientist. But there’s no question that stewards are equally important stakeholders in the purchasing process as analysts and scientists and startups selling data analysis tools should address their needs too. Personas become even more powerful when they span organizational divisions. For example using the product team’s personas sales and marketing teams can craft the proper message to interest and close a customer by demonstrating how particular product features solve the customer’s problem. This continuity of personas creates alignment from product planning through to customer sales and success. When used this way personas provide a framework for the product team to receive feedback from the sales and marketing teams on what’s working and what isn’t. Personas are valuable tools for creating a common language to discuss customers and customer needs. In addition they ensure all the key stakeholders’ needs are met. Last personas align a startup’s efforts around particular needs and focus all the different teams on the same customer issues and needs saving time and improving the company’s sales effectiveness. Consider using them with your team. Published 2014-10-09,Published 2014-10-09
http://tomtunguz.com/yc-demo-day-spring-2014/,Reflections on YCombinator Demo Day: How the Seed Market Has Changed,Reflections on YCombinator Demo Day: How the Seed Market Has Changed Earlier this week I attended the Spring YCombinator Demo Day. I’ve been attending for six years now. Each time I’m impressed by the intelligence ambition and the polish of the founders presenting companies only a few weeks or months old. As I listened to the pitches I wondered if the types of startups founders decide to build at YC has changed over time and whether those trends are lagging or leading indicators of the market as a whole. At each Demo Day the YC team provides investors a list of all the companies pitching and I’ve kept a few. To get a sense of the broader trends in YC companies I’ve compared the Winter 2012 class and the Spring 2014 class by sector (consumer v. enterprise) segment (ecommerce education social gaming delivery) and by revenue model (subscription ads transactional). These are the trends I observed in the data: Mild shift toward enterprise: In 2012 48% of YC startups were enterprise. In 2014 enterprise startups were 57% of the class. Within enterprise there has been a shift toward industry specific Software-as-a-Service (vertical SaaS) at the expense of horizontal SaaS. Vertical SaaS startups comprised 29% of the 2012 enterprise companies and 40% of the 2014 class. To make this idea more concrete here are two examples. VidPresso provides software to the TV broadcast industry and is an example of vertical SaaS. ZenPayoll a provider of payroll services serves many different types of businesses and is a horizontal SaaS company. Platforms-as-a-Service which enable developers to build and scale applications (Heroku) have also seen a decline in numbers. In 2012 there were 5 PaaS companies while in 2014 I counted 2. Shifting to consumer social apps have fallen from 24% of consumer startups to 15% at the most recent demo day. Unlike the 2012 class there were no gaming companies in 2014. Food delivery companies education companies and consumer market places have cropped up in their place. As for revenue models subscription remains dominant. 53% of 2012 YC companies chose this revenue model and 56% chose it in 2014. Also notable is a marked increase in the number of non-profits. The 2014 class graduated 6 of them up from zero in 2012. All in all YC startups do seem to be shifting with the market and/or YC partners are screening for startups that are more reflective of the environment. The shifts toward vertical SaaS and away from social and gaming apparent in this class are consistent with the patterns I’m seeing in the fund raising market. Unfortunately the data isn’t able to tell us who is setting the trend. In any case I’ll be tracking these trends in the future and hope to be able to draw more conclusions over time.

And the typical seed investment size has risen by 25% in just the last 12 months. In 2014 for the first time in four years median Series A round size have increased. When we analyzed the data last year this wasn’t the case. But in 2014 the median Series A hit $6.8M increasing 14% over the trailing three year average. These larger seed rounds aren’t elongating the period between seed and Series A. The typical startup raises their A about 400 days or 13 months after the close of their seed just the same as four years ago. And the correlation between seed round size and series A round size is still weak: the R^2 is about 0.35 a figure which has actually declined over the past four years. So larger seed rounds aren’t correlated with larger Series As. Startups are raising larger Series As for two reasons. First startups are growing faster than ever before. Second investors have raised huge amounts of capital. In 2014 VCs raised close to $50B nearly 2x more than the median over the last 15 years and half the amount in 2000. This increased competition increases prices. Series Bs and Series Cs have increased in size over the past few years and so have seeds. But 2014 was the first year in which the Series A round size grew. All this data underscores how fertile a fundraising environment exists for founders. Round sizes valuations and numbers of rounds are all expanding quickly. Part and parcel of this expansion are more competition for talent and real estate and more competitors in attractive sectors and consequent greater startup operating costs.

Enabling an organization to make data driven decisions is a long term process. Below is the current big data adoption process and where we are within it: Companies generate proprietary data whose volumes can’t be handled by existing tools. The main adopters of these technologies are financial services healthcare genomics and web companies. Companies build or buying the tools and expertise to store and process that data. Major vendors include Cloudera MapR HortonWorks Splunk GoodData Vertica Greenplum and many others. These new tools demand new skill sets within the organization: data storage expertise data processing acumen analytical ability modeling skills visualization expertise. As the infrastructure to support data analysis matures data scientists become the bottleneck within the organization as they are beseiged by data questions. Tools emerge to enable analysis at edges of the organization so sales marketing product and everyone else can perform the analysis without having to submit a request to the data science team. While the ecosystem is quite young and there will be innovation at every step in the process above the next wave of innovation in the data science market will occur in the last stage of the process above: the democratization of data analysis.

http://tomtunguz.com/earnings-scorecard-2/,What the Public Markets Trends Say About the Fundraising and M&A Environment Startups,What the Public Markets Trends Say About the Fundraising and M&A Environment Startups Through last week 80% of fast-growing technology companies who reported Q2 earnings had met or exceeded expectations on average by 4%. As the earnings season has progressed the tech sector is showing impressive signs of strength and predictability in the underlying companies’ business. Startups benefit from a booming public market for three reasons. First strong earnings buoy public technology share prices which drives M&A. The chart above shows the relationship between beating earnings and Enterprise Value to Trailing-Twelve Month Revenue Multiple (EV/TTM Rev). The correlation exceeds 0.53 indicating a moderately strong connection. As a consequence of higher stock prices stock increases in value and cash becomes easier to raise and relatively less expensive both of which entice tech publics to acquire startups extending the current vibrant M&A market. Second the valuation multiples commanded by public companies cascade to some extent to the private markets first to the later stage businesses raising pre-IPO rounds and eventually to the earlier stage markets. After the correction of about 40% enterprise companies and of 25% in consumer names the median enterprise revenue multiple has popped back up 7.4x from 5.2x and consumer has increased similarly to 7.0x. Anecdotally I haven’t seen much of a decline in early stage startup valuations after the February correction in the public markets. And the recent increase in multiples implies there is no deflationary pressure on startup valuations from the public markets. Third the relative predictability consumer and enterprise publics indicates a relative fertile environment for startups to sell into. Advertising-driven models SaaS business models consumer hardware and marketplaces are all represented in the earnings figures so far. There are some EPS negative outliers most notably Amazon. But Amazon’s massive EPS miss has more to do with large scale capital investment in AWS than a lack of a profitable business or customer base. Below are the updated Revenue Surprise and Earnings per Share Surprise charts for the tech companies in the consumer and enterprise baskets I’ve been tracking. This represents about half of the companies in those baskets but at this point should provide a pretty representative view of the state of public technology companies. Overall business is go go go for technology companies despite the blip earlier this year in the stock market. And as the public companies exceed expectations they will be pulling startups up with them. Published 2014-08-04,Published 2014-08-04
http://tomtunguz.com/cloud-vc-dollar-efficiency/,Do Startups Require Less Capital to Succeed than 10 Years Ago?,Do Startups Require Less Capital to Succeed than 10 Years Ago? Last week we analyzed the fund raising history of billion dollar SaaS companies and determined SaaS startups are raising nearly twice as much capital as 16 years ago before going public. Given that trend I wondered if there is there any truth to the idea that startups today require less capital than before to succeed. To answer that question I’ve taken the same basket of public SaaS companies and computed a revenue-on-invested-capital (ROIC) across the four 4-year IPO cohorts from 1998-2014. The revenue-on-invested-capital is the revenue at IPO divided by the venture dollars raised pre-IPO inflation adjusted and measured in 2014 dollars. In other words the efficiency score marks the number of venture dollars invested to generate one revenue dollar at IPO-time.* The line chart above shows the trend across the four different IPO cohorts from 1998-2014. The blue line shows the median ROIC and the red line shows the average ROIC. Before 2002 the median ROIC never exceeded 0.9. But afterwards in both the 2006 and 2010 buckets the median exceeded 1.15 indicating a remarkable increase in capital efficiency. The trend is more pronounced in the average metric which grew from 0.822 2.0 over the course of the same 16 years. Even more astounding the number of companies in each bucket has increased indicating that this increase in sales efficiency is broad-based. Also of note there are more outliers in the recent cohorts. These outliers which ROIC scores greater than three have much more efficient sales models than the typical SaaS company. They include BazaarVoice LinkedIn Medidata SolarWinds Tableau and Veeva. All of those companies were in the latter two IPO cohorts. Below is the table of the data to show these trend in a bit more detail. IPO Cohort Average ROIC Median ROIC Count 1998 0.82 0.82 2 2002 1.05 0.88 6 2006 1.78 1.15 13 2010 2.00 1.24 15 The average revenue-on-invested-capital has more than doubled during the 16 years while the median ROIC has increased by 50%. While a t-test fails to prove with statistical significance that SaaS businesses are more efficient the trend is certainly pointing in the right direction. But the average and median are hiding an interesting phenomenon a tale of two types of companies. Splitting the 2010 IPO cohort in two the medians look very different. There’s a new breed of SaaS company that is far far more capital efficient than ever before. Why? Over the past 16 years the sales models for SaaS companies become better refined and startups have begun to benefit greatly from the reduced costs of building and deploying on cloud infrastructure. The resulting efficiencies have begun to shine in the financial statements and imply some terrifically successful and efficient SaaS businesses are yet to be built! *Because Veeva is such an outlier having raised $4.3M (inflation adjusted) and having generated $210M in the trailing twelve months of its IPO earning it a ROIC of 59 I’ve removed it from the analysis.

http://tomtunguz.com/why-the-whatsapp-acquisition-changes-everything/,Why the WhatsApp Acquisition Changes Everything,Why the WhatsApp Acquisition Changes Everything From zero to $19B of business value in five years; WhatsApp’s sale to Facebook is an important moment in the history of the consumer web. The deal proves distribution reach and large user bases aren’t the competitive moats they once were. Apple’s App Store and Google Play have leveled the playing field to such an extent that a startup can command 10% of the market cap from a $200B company. To reach scale in the search-driven world of the web meant waiting 90 days to appear in the Google search rankings maximizing inbound links optimizing anchor text. In those web days a startup couldn’t dream of appearing as the first search result on their launch day. It was an impossibility. But in mobile this happens all the time. Startups launch and on their first day in the iTunes store the app hits the top of the charts # 1. This possibility allows the world to turn on its head very quickly for Instagram to create a $1B company in 18 months with 30M users and for Whatsapp to amass a rabidly engaged mobile user base larger than Facebook’s. Mobile app store rankings don’t value historical relationships the way web search does. What have you done for your users lately they ask? These near-instant feedback loops challenge incumbents to continue to earn the attention of their user bases with better products than rivals’ applications. As a result Clay Christensen’s innovator’s dilemma surfaces not every decade like the stories of steel mini-mills or hard drive makers but every 18 months. Because the mobile user base is 10x larger than the PC world because the older competitive moats don’t work because the disruption cycles are so fast competition in the consumer web has never been fiercer. Ergo massive acquisitions. There will be a litany of cascading effects from this massive acquisition. I suspect consumer pre-money valuations will surge founders will redouble their efforts to build strategically important services and innovation will accelerate. For incumbents the race is on to save their businesses. For startups the opportunity to disrupt has never been more accessible. Published 2014-02-23,Published 2014-02-23
http://tomtunguz.com/revenue-per-employee/,Revenue per Employee Benchmarks of Billion Dollar Companies,Revenue per Employee Benchmarks of Billion Dollar Companies One way of measuring the efficiency of a company’s revenue model is to benchmark revenue per employee. Google and Facebook the two most efficient companies generate $1M per revenue per employee per year. Setting aside those exceptional cases and focusing instead on SaaS companies the typical average revenue per employee is about $190k to $210k per year. The histogram above shows the ranges for publicly traded SaaS companies. In the scatterplot above which compares revenue per employee to revenues (in log10 scale) the outliers pop out. Financial Engines (FNGN) is the most efficient publicly traded SaaS company at $500k in revenue per employee and LifeLock isn’t far behind. Salesforce (CRM) and LinkedIn (LNKD) are much closer to the average range while other darlings like WorkDay (WDAY) and Tableau (DATA) are close to $100k. Revenue per employee isn’t a leading indicator of success but a lagging one. It’s also a composite metric that is negatively impacted by significant waves of hiring sales team ramp time product and company maturity in a market and many other factors. Notably there isn’t much of a correlation between the revenue per employee and total revenues (R^2 of 0.2) or market cap (R^2 of 0.06) so revenue per employee doesn’t seem to limit the growth of company or hamper valuation. All of this means revenue per employee isn’t a metric to optimize for. Rather it’s a helpful as broad benchmark of the general efficiency of a business and a place to start analyzing employee productivity if a business deviates too much from the comparables.

http://tomtunguz.com/which-acquirer-for-your-startup/,Which Acquirer Pays the Most for Startups?,Which Acquirer Pays the Most for Startups? A few days ago Simply Business published an infographic and data on the acquisition patterns of Amazon Apple Facebook Google and Yahoo. Looking at that data I wondered which acquirers pay the most for startups. Ideally this data provides some negotiating leverage to founders selling their businesses. I’ve prepared three charts and a table to tell the story. The first compares the average acquisition prices over the life of each of the tech monoliths. The y-axis is in log scale. A value of 2 means $10M^2 or $100M. On the whole the average acquisition prices are all in the same ball park. Facebook and Google have outliers demarcated by dots which are WhatsApp and DoubleClick Nest Motorola for Google. Next let’s look at M&A activity by company. Google is also by far the most acquisitive company averaging 11 acquisitions per year since 1999. This is close to twice the pace of Facebook at second place with 6.7. Amazon and Apple are much less acquisitive. The last column shows the largest acquisition completed by the acquirer. Apple is notable for the contrast between the $40B in cash on its balance sheet and the $390M largest acquisition in the past 15 years. I suppose Apple believe the best innovations come from within. A note about data quality: in this data set the large tech companies reported the values of on average 43% of their acquisitions which are disproportionately the smaller ones. Google discloses the fewest transactions only 35%. Undisclosed Total Disclosed M&A/Year Max Acq. $1B+ Amazon 22 37 40.5% 2.5 928 0 Apple 24 44 45% 2.9 390 0 Facebook 23 41 44% 6.7 19000 1 Google 93 144 35% 11.1 12500 4 Yahoo 44 87 49% 5.7 5004 4 Now that we have a sense of activity and averages let’s segment these acquisition histories by transaction size to get a sense of willingness-to-pay. I’ve divided the data into quintiles five equally sized chunks of acquisitions. These quintiles are <$25M <$40M <$100M <$330M and <$19B. The chart below shows the number of companies in each quintile by acquirer. Apple and Facebook seem to prefer smaller acquisitions or at least have a disproportionate share of them. Amazon makes fewer smaller acquisitions prefering $100M+. Google and Yahoo show almost uniform distributions in their M&A. Next let’s look at prices within each of these segments. The boxplot below shows the distribution of prices paid by each acquirer in each of the different quintiles. Facebook shows the largest acquisition averages in two of the five quintiles ($40M and $19B) Yahoo shows the largest acquisition average in one quintile ($25M) and Amazon and Apple round out the five. In the acquihire bucket Amazon pays the least by a substantial margin. Google and Yahoo seem to offer the best prices; Apple has a lower average but a $15M mean still places Apple 50% above Facebook’s. In the $25-$40M bucket Apple and Google seem to have a $30M ceiling on prices here displaying almost no variance from it. Facebook and Yahoo show more flexibility. Next in the $40M-$100M bucket Facebook and Google acquire throughout the spectrum. Amazon pays a premium while Apple and Yahoo bargain-shop. In the $100-$330M segment Amazon and Apple show the highest averages at around $250M while Google and Yahoo have means of around $150M. Note the non-zero y-axis here which artifically accentuates the differences. This is a bug in the plotting library I use. Last in the billion-dollar bucket the data is dominated by exceptions: WhatApps DoubleClick Overture YouTube Motorola. It’s hard to draw a conclusion. In summary Amazon doesn’t seem to make acquihires while Yahoo Facebook and Google seem to acquire quite a few. Neither Apple nor Amazon make large acquisitions while Yahoo and Google have 80% market share of $1B+ M&A in this data set. There seems to be no consistent pattern on M&A willingness-to-pay across these segments so it’s hard to recommend a universal strategy to maximize acquisition price based on past behavior aside from speaking with the corp dev teams who tend to be most active in a given category or transaction size. This is just one way of looking at the data. I’ve tried to tell one story using a post-hoc analysis but I suspect much of the variation in the acquisition data is driven by individual companies and transactions rather than a long-term acquisition strategy.

http://tomtunguz.com/three-key-elements-sales-compensation-plan/,3 Key Ingredients of a Sales Compensation Plan,3 Key Ingredients of a Sales Compensation Plan Like most things in a startup a sales commission plan should evolve as the company scales. For example as Mark Roberge CRO of Hubspot wrote in The Sales Acceleration Formula Hubspot adopted three different sales compensation plans throughout its early evolution which embody the three key ingredients of a sales compensation plan. Hubspot’s first sales plan paid $2 of commission for every $1 of MRR an account executive booked. When the company decided to focus on revenue retention the sales team adopted a new sales model. Account executives were divided into quartiles by customer retention. The top quartile received $4 of commission for $1 of MRR; the next quartile received $3 and so on. Hubspot’s third sales model paid $2 for every $1 of MRR but not immediately. 50% of the commission was paid in the first month 25% in the sixth month 25% in the twelfth month - provided of course the customer was still subscribed. Hubspot’s journey highlights the three key components of a sales compensation plan: commission ratio acceleration and payment schedule. The commission ratio of a sales compensation plan equals the customer revenue divided by the sales cost for a year. In the case of the $2 commission for $1 of MRR the commission ratio is 3.3 calculated in the table below. $2 for $1 Commission Plan $2 for $1 Commission Plan Quota 400000 Monthly MRR Quota 2778 Monthly MRR Commission 5556 Annual MRR Commission 66667 Annualized Customer Revenue 216667 Commission Ratio 3.3 I’ve assumed a quota of $400000 in bookings for this AE which implies a monthly MRR quota of $2.8k. If the AE achieves plan the commission is twice the quota or $5.5k; multiplied for 12 months equals $67k. The annualized customer revenue is $217k or the sum of MRR for all customers over the first year. This implies a 3.3 commission ratio. Most commission plans I’ve seen for inside sales teams maintain a commission ratio between 3 and 4. The lower the commission ratio the more a company pays to each AE for a sale and vice versa. Each company’s commission ratio will vary depending on quite a few factors. For example lower commission ratios are common when salespeople are educating the customer base and experiencing longer sales cycles. Companies can sustain higher payment ratios when account executives can sustain high sales velocity - meaning they can close deals quickly. Ultimately the sales commission plan has to balance the cost to the business and the ability of the account executive to earn market wage. Acceleration is second part of the sales commission plan. Not all commission plans feature acceleration. Hubspot’s first plan doesn’t. If a sales rep closes 125% of quota or $3.4k in a month the sales rep receives $6.9k. However it’s common to see accelerators. For example if an AE closes 125% of quota the rep would earn 125% commission or $8.7k in a month. On the positive side accelerators reward above-quota performance. On the negative side accelerators can encourage sandbagging - the practice of lumping contracts in one particular period to juice the commission payouts. Like any incentive accelerators must be actively managed. Hubspot’s second commission plan employs accelerators but based on a different axis customer retention rather than quota outperformance. This is a great example of how to align the incentives of the sales team with other parts of the business in this case customer success. Payout timing is the third component of the sales compensation. Hubspot’s third plan delays the commission payout to encourage customer retention. Payment timing can also be used to encourage setting the right expectations with customers pursue account expansion and promote renewal. Hubspot’s example shows the evolution of their sales plan and the way they embodied three key characteristics of a startup’s compensation plan. There is no global optimum for sales plans. They must evolve with time and reflect the needs of the business. Published 2015-03-30,Published 2015-03-30
http://tomtunguz.com/zero-to-one/,A Collection of Uncommon Points of View on Startups,A Collection of Uncommon Points of View on Startups I wish I had been in Stanford’s CS183 class in 2012 the year Peter Thiel taught it. A student of the class Blake Masters copied all the class notes and I read every post like thousands of other visitors to the site. In a few days Thiel and Masters will release a book version of these notes called Zero to One: Notes on Startups or How to Build the Future. I was given a copy at TechCrunch Disrupt. Over the past day or so I’ve read it in its entirety. Every person curious about or in the world of startups should read it because it contains so much original thought. These are my three favorite ideas from the book. Idea 1: Founders should aim to create monopolies. Because a business’ current value is the sum of its discounted future profits the businesses that maximize long-term profits are the most valuable. But competition increases costs. So to maximize profits and minimize costs a startup should prohibit competitors from developing. In other words founders should build monopolies. (p. 48-53) Four attributes characterize monopolies. First proprietary technology. Second network effects that enable the business to grow faster as it scales. Third economies of scale which reduce the costs of growth over time. Fourth a brand. All of these elements create barriers to entry that defend the future profits of the startup and reinforce monopoly power. Idea 2: Disruption is the wrong mind-set. Today’s mantra of disrupting industries focuses startups on existing competitive markets. Competitive markets reduce profits to zero. Most disruptive companies are better faster and cheaper versions of incumbents’ products. Without a fundamental cost advantage a cheaper product is a less profitable product. Consequently the disruptive company offering the product is less valuable. Instead of disrupting founders should be focused on creating new markets and technologies where none exist. (p. 56-57) Idea 3: The four lessons we learnt from the dot-com era are wrong. The turbulence of the dot-com era engendered a more conservative startup development philosophy: the Lean Startup. Thiel argues the major concepts of Lean Startup don’t create the most valuable types of companies monopolies. I’ve listed those concepts below with Thiel’s counter-argument written after the double colon. (p. 20-21) Make incremental advances :: Incremental advances don’t lead to defensible technology. Stay lean and flexible :: A bad plan is better than no plan. Improve on the competition :: Competitive markets destroy profits. Focus on product not sales :: Superior sales and distribution can create monopoly even without product differentiation. The converse is not true. Each of these ideas has arguments and counter-arguments. Because these ideas differ so much from the conventional wisdom they arresting and demand deeper thought. I suspect one of the ramifications of publishing the book is there will be many founders and investors debating their applicability. Aside from these three ideas the book includes many other great tactical concepts including thoughts on the composition of a founding team startup culture and go-to-market strategies. In addition Thiel discusses the philosophy of the day (”indefinite optimism”) and discusses the challenges with this mindset. The book differs from the notes in one important way: it’s written in Thiel’s voice. Consequently the stories are more tangible and the arguments are more forceful than in the notes but they are also more concise. I found myself going back to the notes for some more context around particular arguments. Together they are a great resource for founders. Zero to One is a great read and an important book because the key ideas of the book will become part of the language of the valley. Published 2014-09-11,Published 2014-09-11
http://tomtunguz.com/q314-earnings-scorecard/,The Stability of the Current Tech Market,The Stability of the Current Tech Market It’s Q3 earnings season and about half of the major public tech companies and recent startup IPOs have reported their figures. I keep track of earnings to get a sense for how these companies perceive their markets. Meeting or exceeding earnings indicates companies can forecast their growth and demonstrates how predictable these businesses are. The more predictable the more stable the business environment and consequently the fund raising environment for startups. The chart above shows the revenue surprise figures for the companies who have reported earnings so far. Revenue surprise is the percent difference of actual revenue per share figures compared to the estimated ones prepared by analysts. 69% of these tech publics exceeded forecasts in Q3 which compares to 60% in Q2. Similar to last quarter consumer companies constitute the majority of the revenue misses: Amazon Angie’s List eBay GreenDot Google Trulia Xoom. In fact the median consumer company equaled revenue estimates whereas enterprise companies surpassed them by 2%. But the difference is likely insignificant. Now to profits. 65% of these companies exceeded earnings. Interestingly the enterprise company beat EPS estimates by 7% compared to consumer companies who again matched estimates. Overall high growth tech companies seem to be operating in very stable and predictable environments a great sign for the tech and startup fundraising markets.

http://tomtunguz.com/thinking-through-valuations/,It’s Time to Start Worrying About the Next Round for Your Startup,It’s Time to Start Worrying About the Next Round for Your Startup There’s an adage that is being passed around by entrepreneurs that goes something like this: “As soon as you raise this round it’s time to start worrying about the next round.” I think it’s a wise adage. It’s similar to my most important principle of fund raising which is “Raise enough money to achieve a set of milestones that will attract a subsequent round of investment from new investors.” Those two ideas are simple and logical. But what does this mean for the business on a very tactical level? How much revenue? How much dilution should an entrepreneur expect? What should valuations look like over time? Below I’ve tried to summarize the way a hypothetical startup might think about the cap table evolution valuation and revenue growth. First and foremost a huge caveat: every business is different. Every financing is unique and this data is based on generalization and medians and averages. Capitalization Table Evolution Below is a hypothetical cap table for a startup through four rounds of financing seed through Series A. The table shows the common shares ownership with time and the typical investment stakes of seed A B and C investors. These stakes are highly variable (see caveat). The most important line for the founding team is the last line called Equivalent Exit Price. This metric tracks the exit price of the business required to generate $30M in net proceeds to the founders with each subsequent round of financing/dilution. Keep in mind the point of raising money is to create a larger and larger company. As always it’s important to align VC and founder incentives on exit size Ownership(in %) Founding Seed Series A Series B Series C Common 100 65 50 39 29 Seed investors 15 10 6 4 A Investors 25 25 25 B Investors 20 20 C Investors 15 Pool 20 15 10 7 Equivalent Exit Price (in $M) 30 46 60 77 103 Valuation Evolution Below is the evolution of the valuation of our hypothetical startup. Again this is highly variable. I’m estimating valuation using the forecasted burn for 18 months of runway and dividing that by the new investor's share. It’s an estimate because I don’t take into account the dollars the insiders would contribute as pro-rata but it’s good enough for our purposes. Valuation Evolution Ownership(in %) Founding Seed Series A Series B Series C Employees 7 18 45 75 Cost per Employee (in $) 12000 12000 12000 12000 18 Month Burn (in $M) 0.5 1.5 3.9 9.7 16.2 Implied valuation (est.) 10 16 49 108 Revenue Evolution This last table shows the revenue growth of our hypothetical startup. I calculate revenue by taking the valuation and then using a calendar year valuation to revenue multiple - called CY Revenue Multiple in this chart. That figure is an average of more than 25 SaaS businesses’s financing histories. Revenue Evolution Ownership(in %) Founding Seed Series A Series B Series C CY Revenue Multiple 13 11 15 Implied CY Revenue (in $M) 1 4 7 Frameworks Not Absolutes My aim with this post is to provide a framework for thinking through the cap table revenue and valuation evolution of your startup over time. The particular figures will vary depending on market cycles sectors teams ideas and a thousand other variables. But in sharing this framework I hope it helps those entrepreneurs plan for a successful financing path for this fund raise and every fund raise for their business - a little bit of tactics to promote that great adage above.

It used to be impossible to convey that insight to anyone who might be in a position to act upon it. But that’s all changing because of the Internet. Of late it’s becoming increasingly easier for consumers to share their ideas for great products and bring them to market. One great example of this is a company called Quirky which solicits ideas from a community of people all over the world. It refines the ideas prototypes them leveraging the insights of the community and then manufactures these products and sends them to retailers. Quirky solves many of the challenges in bringing products to market. I believe great product design and simple connectivity will be the defining principle of success for connected consumer products. For many products connectivity to the Internet breathes magic into once static objects. That’s the vision behind one of Redpoint’s investments Electric Imp. Combining the product design expertise of Quirky with the magic connectivity of Electric Imp enables regular people to dream of new ideas and work with Quirky and Electric Imp to create and bring these new inventions. Over the next few weeks Electric Imp Quirky and GE all partners in innovation will solicit ideas for connected devices and then work to build these products and bring them to market.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-myth-of-the-generalist/,The myth of the generalist,The myth of the generalist When I started working at Google I heard the word generalist over and over. “We only hire generalists” I was told. Eight years later this mantra is pretty common. I hear it often both referring to the desired characteristics of new hires and also the aspirations of a team - “we want to be a team of generalists”. At the time I understood the word generalist to mean someone really good at a lot of things. In computer science it might mean an engineer who is great at Javascript CSS HTML Java Rails MapReduce NodeJS - familiar with every technology up and down the stack. But these engineers are unicorns - they’re mythical. Even if I were to find one how could an interview possibly screen for such depth of knowledge? And is a walking technical encyclopedia really the right fit for a startup? Reading through Drucker’s Effective Executive I came across this passage which I think is a much better definition: The only meaningful definition of a “generalist” is a specialist who can relate his own small area to the universe of knowledge. Peter Drucker In other words a generalist is someone has demonstrated learning one field who has an open mind and who can articulate relationships between known domains and new ideas. A team built of these types of people would be a great fit for a startup - smart flexible thinkers who communicate well. Startups bob and weave. They change architectures and products and markets and tactics. Startups need teams who can change the tires on the bus as it’s traveling at 60 mph; they need a team of MacGyvers who combine a little bit of knowledge a wad of gum(ption) from their pocket and some raw smarts to solve a problem. That’s my kind of generalist. Published 2012-12-19,Published 2012-12-19

Broadly speaking most of that code base is customer facing. But to be successful the product must be supported by a litany of great “invisible” technology - the internal tools and products that help a company scale. They are the skeleton of the startup. At Google there were hundreds if not thousands of small internal tools built to solve problems. CRM tools email automation tools with canned responses lead prioritization tools project databases weekly snippets for reporting email lists and so on. We built these tools following Larry’s advice to his teams which was to find a problem or inefficiency generalize it as much as possible then build a tool to automate it and then tune it over time. It was the only way we could scale. In AdSense operations the average account manager supported more than 10000 customers (!) because of the tools. Like Google startups build many of these tools in house. Sometimes they purchase off the shelf solutions. In either case these essential supporting cast members enable startups to grow much faster. I think about a startup’s toolkit in three buckets: First technology tools ensure high quality code and a responsive product: Developer tools - regression testing continuous deployment (CircleCi) Operational tools - deployment management (Puppet) application performance management (New Relic Crittercism) Second marketing and sales tools build and manage customer pipelines: Marketing tools - email performance (Sailthru Userfox) social media monitoring (HootSuite) Sales tools - CRM (Salesforce Streak) webinar tools salespitch tools (ClearSlide) salesforce education tools (Bloomfire) customer support (Zendesk) Third financial and BI tools help the company measure and forecast: BI tools - website data (Mixpanel) core business metrics (Gooddata Datameer Periscope) HR tools - performance management and recruitment (Workday JobVite Lever) Financial tools - planning and analysis (Tidemark) expense management (Expensify) Billing (Zuora) These tools provide the infrastructure for startups to grow rapidly but this is an area where startups continuously underinvest. Trying to change the tires on the bus as it’s traveling 60 miles an hour is tough - but it’s worth the investment. The bus will travel faster. Every quarter take a step back examine your internal processes and make sure that your teams are building the invisible infrastructure that will help your startup blossom.

http://tomtunguz.com/bottoms-up-or-top-down/,Which is a More Efficient Way to Build a SaaS Startup - Bottoms Up or Top Down?,Which is a More Efficient Way to Build a SaaS Startup - Bottoms Up or Top Down? An entrepreneur last week asked me if bottoms up businesses are more efficient software companies than top down sales processes. Enabled by web and mobile app distribution the bottoms up software business acquires individual users small teams and eventually departments. The top down model sells to a C-level executive (CEO CIO CFO) and captures the relevant part of the organization through one sales process. Because the bottoms up processes tend to rely on seemingly less expensive customer acquisition techniques like content marketing and in-product up-sell initially this founder suggested quite reasonably I thought that bottoms up companies are more efficient. In this post we’ll compare the efficiencies of bottoms up and top down companies across four dimensions: revenue growth gross margin profitability and capital raised. I curated a bucket of companies for each category. Zendesk Hubspot New Relic and Tableau represent the Bottoms Up bucket. Workday Responsys Demandware Taleo and ServiceNow in the Top Down bucket. The revenue chart above shows the individual revenue growth trajectories of the companies in each basket demarcated by color: red for Bottoms Up and blue for Top Down. Top Down companies ServiceNow and Workday have tracked the two fastest and highest magnitude growth curves. Zendesk is tracing ServiceNow’s revenue trajectory. Using statistical analysis however we can’t prove a difference between the revenue growth patterns of Bottoms Up and Top Down companies. Let’s examine the gross profit of each type of business. Top Down companies should offer more professional services which should depress gross margins compared to Bottoms Up companies. The chart above shows the average value for each type of company as a line and the area depicts the value of one standard deviation out from the mean. The Bottoms Up companies do seem to exhibit a 15 percentage point advantage in gross margin which is consistent with the theory that professional services depress Top Down approaches. The variance of the Bottoms Up gross margin is substantially greater than the Top Down companies which have far greater consistency in their gross margin profiles. However again the data isn’t strong enough yet to be statistically significant. Net Income/Profitability seems to be roughly equal for the two types of companies. Both types of companies seem cross the profitability threshold around year 10. Bottoms Up companies exhibit greater losses in year 6 and generally speaking see a greater variance in profitability. Last the box plot above shows the distribution of capital raised by company type. Surprisingly Bottoms Up companies tend to raise more. The dollars raised analysis is challenged by a few different factors. First not all these companies raised money because they needed it so venture capital raised isn’t a pure proxy for cash burn. Second the cyclicality of the venture market has a greater impact on total dollars raised. For example New Relic’s first two rounds were $3.4M and $8.9M both of which occurred in 2008 would likely have been substantially larger today. Here are the individual data points: Bottoms Up Bottoms Up Top Down Top Down Company $M Raised Company $M Raised New Relic 216 Workday 189 HubSpot 101 ServiceNow 84 Zendesk 71 Responsys 63 Tableau 15 DemandWare 53 Taleo 26 Ultimately the data shows great businesses can be built using both sales methodologies. We can’t prove with this data set that there are meaningful differences in any of four measures of startup efficiency including revenue growth gross margin profitability or cash raised. Perhaps that will change as the many private software companies go public and we can analyze more data from the relatively newer Bottoms Up approach. But for now we can say both approaches produce equally efficient companies. Published 2015-05-03,Published 2015-05-03
http://tomtunguz.com/vc-process-stages/,The Four Key Steps in Startup Fund Raising Processes,The Four Key Steps in Startup Fund Raising Processes Raising capital from venture capitalists at any stage can seem like a very strange ambiguous and amorphous process. I’ve written about the way Redpoint diligences/researches a startup and its market and what questions we tend to ask at each stage. In this post I’ll focus on the process from entrepreneur’s point of view. When raising capital entrepreneurs will see potential investors move through four phases of investment decision-making process: screening socialization diligence and decision. I’ve drawn a schematic that illustrates this evolution above. The chart also shows a line indicating the progression from one step to the next using data from my own investment funnels. Screening: the first call and/or first meeting. The screening step can include associates principals and/or one or two partners. In this phase investors are evaluating the risks of the investment the market size and the industry to determine if it’s a fit with their fund size and investment goals. Looking at my CRM data roughly 15% of startups continue onto the next stage. Socialization: excited by a startup’s pitch and prospects the partner/team who met with the company will share their knowledge with other members of the firm. VCs typically ask for second meetings during socialization. In second meetings founders repeat the pitch to a broader group within the firm though typically not the entirety of the partnership. If the deal team resonates with the founders and the opportunity and vice-versa the deal team begins diligence. Again about 15% of startups move onto diligence. Diligence: the deal team begins researching the opportunity and share their findings with the broader partnership. This includes evaluating the team the market product roadmap and sales pipeline. Behind the scenes VCs call contacts in industry to refine their point of view. As the research progresses VCs will often volley questions back to the startup seeking clarification. Typically the diligence process is focused on a few key questions like market size defensibility regulatory risk or competition. Increasingly investors and founders discuss deal structure and outline deal terms at this stage. After diligence about 10% of startups continue to the final “Partner Meeting” a meeting of all the partners in a venture firm or the entirety of the VC’s investment committee. Decision: This the “Partner Meeting.” Beforehand the deal team briefs the partnership on all the diligence materials key questions and deal terms. Founders pitch the entire partnership. After the meeting all the partners debrief on the opportunity. Some firms provide deal teams latitude to make decisions on their own; others have implemented rigid voting processes to seek approval for investment. Granted approval and with a term sheet in hand VCs then must convince an entrepreneur to sign their term sheet and partner with them. In the past 2 years I’ve been lucky to invest in three companies (Axial Electric Imp and Looker) for a success rate of 6% in this stage or 0.2% throughout the process. For founders it’s important to understand where they are in the process with investors for two reasons. First so as not to misjudge the finish line either by running out of capital in the midst of a process or presume success at too early a stage. Second to build auction pressure in financings to create negotiating leverage on terms. Keeping VCs in stride with each other is one tactic to accomplish this goal. The first part to ensuring a successful fund raising process is understanding the milestones. But ideally after this process is completed a founding team and an investor have built a strong and mutually beneficial relationship that will last many years and throughout the company’s ups and downs.

http://tomtunguz.com/subscriber-cannibalization/,Subscriber Cannibalization and Other Mysteries in Content Marketing,Subscriber Cannibalization and Other Mysteries in Content Marketing As I’ve described in a previous post this blog’s goal is to create and sustain relationships with readers across the startup landscape. Tuning the engine is proving much harder than I expected and I suspect that content marketers are facing similar issues. For example over the past 18 months I’ve witnessed a halving of RSS subscribers to this blog. They have fallen from about 4000 to about 2000. I wasn’t sure what the cause could be until I compared the RSS data with email subscriber data. The chart above contrasts the two data sets. Clearly email subscriptions are cannibalizing RSS subscriptions. Logically the next question to ask then is how to maximize email subscribers. I wondered if the most popular posts generate more email subscribers. Surprisingly no. Below is a table of all the blog posts bucketed by total visitors generated in quartiles. There are an equal number of blog posts sampled in the 1000-1600 visitor bucket as the 2500-25000 visitor bucket. The table compares average new email subscribers generated the percent of visitors those signups represent and the median new subscribers. Visitor Bucket Average New Subs Avg New Sub % Median New Subs 1000 18.6 2.6% 12.0 1600 13.3 1.0% 11 2500 13.7 0.7% 12.0 25000 12.5 0.2% 8.5 Although the average new subs in each bucket does vary a running a t-test proves that the averages aren’t statistically different. In other words the number of new email subscribers to this blog seems to be independent of traffic to the post. Through these two analyses a few things became clear to me. First it’s difficult to explore this data. Three different repositories store the figures needed to create this analysis: Google Analytics FeedBurner and Mailchimp. Aggregating the data meant writing scripts to APIs and then manually cleaning and merging the data. I’d love to see the impact of comments on these metrics. But that means another API another script and some more data cleaning. Second it’s easy to draw the wrong conclusions from the data. Looking only at the average new subs number I might have concluded writing more niche content perhaps code heavy posts with engineers in mind would increase this blog’s readership. But the t-test disproved that hypothesis. Third all this work is time-intensive and for the content marketer looking to maximize daily impact this type of analysis is cost-prohibitive on daily or even weekly basis. Marketing is being transformed and content marketing is a key component of that transformation but the tools to make the right decisions about how to properly market aren’t yet in place. First the data needs to aggregated rationalized and unified. Then a layer of analysis and statistics must be applied. With that in place content marketers and this blog will be much more effective in serving the needs of their audience and achieving their goals. If you’ve seen any tools that might fit the bill please let me know in the comments. I’d love to give them a spin on my data. Published 2014-04-01,Published 2014-04-01
http://tomtunguz.com/a-dog-and-a-monkey/,What a Dog and a Monkey Taught Me About Management at Google,What a Dog and a Monkey Taught Me About Management at Google At all hands meetings on Tuesday afternoons our 75 person AdSense Ops team reviewed the most important metrics for the business: top-two box customer satisfaction scores revenue growth and customer churn. But unlike every other all hands meeting I attended these meetings ended with a monkey and a dog. Our director Kim Malone would stand up and call for two stuffed animals first Whoops the Monkey and Second Duke the Dog both of whom employees had carried to the meeting. At the mention of Whoops a handful of team members would stand up and one-by-one retell the story of a mistake big or small. It might have been a mishandled customer case a forgotten internal data analysis or causing a car accident on the way to work. Often the team’s managers and directors contributed anecdotes. Once or twice an employee’s Whoops mistake cost Google millions of dollars. After hearing all the yarns the team voted on the worst mistake and Whoops would be thrown from one side of the room to the other finding the “winner” of the competition who would put the monkey in his or her cubicle for the week. Then Duke the dog was summoned. In contrast to Whoops’ self-reported monkeywrench mistakes Duke stories are retold by someone else and the dog is a reward for service to the team that went above and beyond the call of duty. Several Googlers would stand and tell a story of a teammate’s dedication: how a colleague alerted them of a problem in a customer’s account or stayed late that week to process unusually high customer support volumes or released an internal tool that might have increased our productivity dramatically. Again the team would vote on the stories and Duke would be bestowed on the winner. Then the all hands meeting adjourned. Despite their childlike simplicity Duke and Whoops were incredibly effective management tools. Whoops created a culture of honesty and transparency where mistakes were shared in an environment of openness trust and support. With Whoops Kim created a culture that valued learning and camraderie over pride. Duke celebrated our internal successes. Each week we wanted to win Duke because we knew whatever effort we contributed at the very least would be celebrated before our teammates and Duke prominently displayed on in our cubicle would remind our teammates and start conversations. That knowledge made us all work harder. To the individual it mattered who won Duke and Whoops. But sharing all of the stories building a community based on shared experience and trust was far more important and beneficial to the team. The dog and the monkey were tools to weave a fabric of shared experience and create a culture of strong values. The first time I interviewed at Google Kim told me about a book she was writing. A little more than 8 years later Kim has finally published that book. This week I’d like to nominate Kim for Duke because of her perseverance and her commitment to achieving her dream.

http://tomtunguz.com/creativity/,The Common Language of Great Teams,The Common Language of Great Teams Last week Redpoint held our annual Founder Day gathering. At the event I listened to the stories of Felix Baumgartner’s record breaking jump from 120000 feet heard about the astonishing comeback of the US America’s Cup team and took part in a creativity workshop led by a Stanford Design School professor. In short the event revolved around doubt. Baumgartner halted the Stratos Project twice during its seven year development. Quite naturally he was terrified of the jump from space. Ten months before competition Jimmy Spithill and his crew capsized and destroyed their $10M America’s Cup catamaran that had required twelve months to build. After overcoming that ordeal with round-the-clock shifts to build a new boat the team found themselves down 1-8 in a race to nine points. The ultimate successes both teams achieved are glorious and unique and that’s where most of the attention naturally flocks. But the most interesting parts of the stories for me were the doubts the flubs the catastrophes; and the processes teams use to recover from them. The successes in both of these cases are very different. But to hear the team captains describe the process to realign and reorient their team I’d have thought they were working on the same project or sailing the same race. The team leaders used the same cliches to describe overcoming adversity: reinforcing a vision developing a strong team culture being open and honest about past failures but always looking forward. All these phrases I’d heard many times before. These banal dictums from successful teams all sound the same because they are the same. And they are often repeated because they’re effective. They are mantras daily practices of teams to build internal momentum. Later in the day an IDEO consultant/Design School professor walked the audience through a creativity exercise. We drew portraits of our neighbors played word games and role played. The professor explained this type of activity formed the basis of practicing creative thought. The goal of the exercise is to stop being so self-aware let go of our self-doubt and enjoy creativity. Creativity is IDEO’s competitive edge in the marketplace. Ensuring the company can routinely innovate and bring new ideas to old problems is a key to their success. Hearing these three stories about the practice of enabling great teams to accomplish incredible goals was inspiring. The most important learning for me is that great teams have processes patterns routines and the discipline that enables them to recover from near-disaster and overcome doubt.

http://tomtunguz.com/management-best-practice-1/,Startup Best Practices 1 - Situational Management,Startup Best Practices 1 - Situational Management In response to yesterday’s post on management design patterns many readers asked for examples of best practices. So I’m going to write about the management best practices I have been taught and I have observed in startups. This is the first post of that series. The first management technique is called Situational Management one that my wife a terrific manager at Google taught me. A manager’s most important function in a startup is to motivate employees to accomplish the business’s goal. Each employee’s motivation to work will vary with time which means a manager’s style and goals should respond to those changes. The same management style doesn’t work across all employees nor can one management style be applied to an employee over their career. In other words effective management depends on the situation. At the highest level there are four basic situations: The image above is a 2x2 matrix with employee skill (defined as the ability to complete the job asked of them) on the x-axis and employee motivation on the y-axis. Each quadrant contains one situation: Low motivation low skill: this one is pretty easy. The person hasn’t been placed in the right role or hasn’t been able to understand how to be effective within the company. It’s time for the company and employee to part ways. High motivation low skill: the most typical state for an employee to be in after he has been hired or promoted. He is excited and energetic but unfamiliar with the particulars of the job or the company or the culture. Somewhat counterintuitively the best management technique in this situation is micromanagement. Despite its reputation micromanagement is a powerful management tool in this situation. The manager must convert the employee’s motivation into skill so the employee will become effective and feel valued. The best way to do this is by frequent check-ins updates and feedback. Applied this way micromanagement provides the employee very fast and very short learning cycles. Each day the employee receives a mini-review of his work. Within a few weeks the employee have learnt quite a bit and become productive. Low motivation high skill: aka burnout. Employees reach this stage after working hard for an extended period of time. The biggest risk for managers with employees in this quadrant is losing them to another employer because of frustration or disillusionment. A manager ought to put this employee “out to pasture” for a week or a few weeks meaning allowing her to work on self-directed projects or projects of passion to recharge her motivation. High motivation high skill: this quadrant contains high-performing employees the ideal state. The best management advice is to get out of the way. Situational management is a simplifying framework to help managers identify the state of each employee and provide the right support to help them fulfill their potential.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-simplest-brand-health-question-for-your-startup/,The Simplest Brand Health Question For Your Startup,The Simplest Brand Health Question For Your Startup For most startups a website or mobile app is the primary place to establish and reinforce a brand a critical part of building a valuable company. But brand health tends to be a hand-wavy amorphous concept. A founder and head of marketing at a company I worked with posed this simple but brilliant question to concretely gauge brand health: If you removed the logo from the website/mobile app could our customers identify the experience as ours? Below are three photos. One of a mobile app one of a web app and one of a store designed to trigger the question without a logo can I identify the company who designed this experience? Mobile App Branding Which app produced this photo? Instagram no question. The distinctive filters are synonymous with the product and so distinctive consumers identify most filtered photos as Instas. Web App Branding Who operates each one of these search engines? Click to enlarge the photo. If you said Google on the left and Bing on the right you’re correct. But for most it’s nearly impossible to differentiate the two product experiences which may be by design on Bing’s part. By emulating Google’s pages Microsoft misses the opportunity to cultivate a different brand experience for search in users' minds. Experience Branding How about this store? Whose is it? No logos anywhere but it’s clearly an Apple Store. Your Startup Cover your website or mobile app’s header. Can you tell if your product is your own? And your employees? Or your customers?

http://tomtunguz.com/recruiting-best-practices-maia-greenhouse/,Startup Best Practices 21 - Your Startup's Recruiting Scorecard,Startup Best Practices 21 - Your Startup's Recruiting Scorecard Last night SaaS Office Hours at Redpoint welcomed Maia Josebachvilli the VP of People and Strategy of Greenhouse. Maia is a thought leader in human resources. Specifically she champions a metrics-based approach for developing world class recruiting teams. Because of her position Maia has observed recruiting patterns in hundreds of companies and has developed best practices for startups. Maia reports these five strategic recruiting metrics to the executive team each quarter. These metrics resemble the diagnostics sales teams use to understand their funnel and provide similar visibility into the efforts and successes of the team. Qualified Candidates/QCs - the equivalent of a sales qualified lead the QC is a leading indicator of whether the team will attain its hiring goals for the quarter. A QC is defined as a phone interview that qualifies a candidate as a good fit for a requisition. By understanding the QC to accepted offer rate over time a company can forecast the odds of attaining the hiring goal that quarter just as sales teams estimate bookings. Days to Close - speed is a competitive advantage in recruiting because the most sought after candidates will have many options. Greenhouse and many other top recruiting companies maintain less than 30 day latency between first contact and signed offer. Candidate Satisfaction - after every interview Greenhouse sends a survey to interviewers to gauge their satisfaction with the process including how well the position was explained how well prepared the interviewers were whether they felt respected and treated courteously. Startups should aim for 70% or better. Offer Acceptance Rate - what fraction of people who receive offers accept them? This figure should be quite high 75% or greater in some cases. If the offer acceptance rate is low the recruiting team should investigate. Some causes include lower candidate satisfaction a slower days to close unclear hiring parameters in the job requisition and miscommunication between recruiting and hiring managers. Hires to Goal - the total number of new hires divided by the goal. A company that isn’t achieving its hires-to-goal number should understand the bottleneck whether in sourcing evaluation or close. A well structured kickoff meeting between the recruiter and the hiring manager is a fundamental requisite to success across all these metrics. In that meeting the hiring manager and recruiter should define two things. First the 30 day goals of the role from which a recruiter will distill the key skills required in the job. For example a data engineering role may require familiarity with data analysis tools. Second the long-term objectives of the job which will reveal the attributes and values of the person. The same data analysis job would require an ability to learn new technologies and simplify complex data into comprehensible insights for the rest of a team. After that conversation the recruiting team can qualify candidates properly describe the role move candidates through the process quickly and prepare themselves to surpass their goals. These five strategic metrics form a simple scorecard to help a startup’s management team evaluate the health of the company’s recruiting efforts each quarter. Consider using them in your startup.

http://tomtunguz.com/phases-of-a-startup/,The stewards of vision and culture,The stewards of vision and culture Vinod Khosla penned a great overview of the three phases of a company this weekend. He identifies the hub and spoke phase the organized chaos phase the functional management phase. Once a founder has experienced each of these phases it’s easy to identify the them in retrospect. But companies don’t transition from one phase to another in discrete steps. Instead they morph and evolve fluidly into these phases. Throughout this metamorphosis two things must remain constant to keep the startup functional: the vision/mission of the company and the culture of the company. Lacking a consistent vision the startup can enter a tailspin - with a team unclear on the path to pursue. Without the right culture teams fall apart. Both of these are responsibilities are those of the founders. Founders are the stewards of vision and culture. And that’s why they are vital to the success of the company at every stage.

http://tomtunguz.com/technologys-monotonic-assault-on-the-human-market-maker/,The Power of Market Places,The Power of Market Places Brokers serve two key roles within ecosystems. First they introduce buyers and sellers. Second they lend their expertise to help buyers and sellers make the right decisions in the market. The internet neutralizes the first value proposition of brokers by leveling the information asymmetry between buyers and sellers at a far greater scale with much better data than any broker ever could. And for products and services with relatively small price points commodity goods or where the cost of failure is low market places often nullify the value (and cost) of an advisor. Market places are arguably the best examples of this kind of disruption. Whether in ad tech (Google AdX) real estate (LoopNet RedFin) accommodation (HomeAway AirBnB) goods (eBay etsy) classifieds (Craigslist) taxis (Uber Hailo) travel (the GDS systems) financial services (AxialMarket Angelist) market places are black holes within ecosystems. Market places exert such gravity that once at scale they are almost impossible to disrupt. Craigslist is the canonical example but all of the companies listed have constructed almost unassailable moats. In real estate and financial services where the value of the assets is measured in the millions or more and each asset is relatively unique advice is valuable and customers will pay for it. So market places serving such verticals provide tools for brokers to succeed. Often these tools provide both lead generation (customers) and management systems (CRM or deal tracking). But as data volumes continue to grow exponentially I believe that the business of brokers of almost every kind will be disrupted. And technology will become the ultimate market maker.

http://tomtunguz.com/breaking-points-of-management/,Startup Best Practices 19 - Recognizing the Breaking Points of Your Startup's Management Structure,Startup Best Practices 19 - Recognizing the Breaking Points of Your Startup's Management Structure Last week I interviewed Tien Tzuo the former CMO & CSO at Salesforce and founder/CEO of Zuora. During our conversation he spoke about one of the major challenges facing fast growing startups. He called it recognizing the breaking points of management. At the founding a startup the structure of the company is flat. Everyone is effectively a peer. At about 8 people a leader must emerge to shepherd the growing team and so the first management layer is created. Then again somewhere around 60 employees the company must add another management layer and then again when the company reaches a few hundred employees. Marco Zappacosta founder and CEO of Thumbtack told me once “As CEO I changed from a contributor to a manager to a manager of managers to a manager of manager of managers. And each time I needed to learn again what it meant to be CEO.” Curiously this pattern is consistent across companies. When startups approach those employee counts communication within the company breaks down and the startup can’t effectively coordinate its people. The telltale signs include confusion in the organization uncoordinated efforts across teams and frustrated employees. There’s theory underpinning why startups consistently feel these growing pains at roughly the same sizes. Henry Fayol a French mining engineer used empirical data observed in coal mines to prove the notion of span of control.. Span of control is the number of subordinates a person manages. As the number of reports increases linearly the number of relationships a manager must oversee grows exponentially. Most companies design teams with a span of control of 7. At Google I was part of the team that calculated span of control across product engineering and other teams. And though there were substantial variances depending on the needs of the team the median was roughly 7. The diagram above depicts the number of management layers the number of employees managed by each layer and the total number of employees assuming 7 span of control. In fact another researcher V.A. Graicunas developed a formula to describe this phenomenon which considers three types of relationships. First manager to report. Second report to report. Third manager to subsets of reports. Relationships to Manage = n(2^(n-1) + n-1); n = # of reports As the table below shows the theoretical complexity increases massively with each subsequent hire. Reports Relationships to Manage 2 6 3 18 4 44 5 100 6 222 7 490 8 1080 9 2376 10 5210 While adding management layers to a startup may not seem like the best way to manage and some companies like Zappos have tried to maintain a flat despite growing to hundreds of employees there’s a substantial body of empirical evidence and research supporting the notion that fast growing companies need to develop management layers to manage their employees and develop them best and that these ranges are roughly consistent across companies. When building your startup keep these rough employee ranges in mind as pivotal points to consider adding another management layer to the company and re-establish a harmony within the growing team.

http://tomtunguz.com/changing-assumptions-opportunity/,How the Changes in UX Assumptions Create Opportunities for Startups,How the Changes in UX Assumptions Create Opportunities for Startups We all build products based on assumptions - assumptions about our users who they are how they think what they expect. When the underlying assumptions underpinning product design no longer holds new opportunities are created. Jakob Nielsen a famed user experience researcher writes about one such secular dislocation of UX assumptions in the Anti-Mac interface. It’s a post written in 1995 that remains remarkably relevant today. It contemplates all the assumptions underpinning the original Apple software design and how the old fundamentals no longer apply for users who have grown up with technology. Below I’ve reproduced all the core Mac UI assumptions from 1995. How many of them changed with the smartphone just ten years later? The Macintosh was designed under a number of constraints including: It needed to sell to “naive users” that is users without any previous computer experience. It was targeted at a narrow range of applications (mostly office work though entertainment and multimedia applications have been added later in ways that sometimes break slightly with the standard interface). It controlled relatively weak computational resources (originally a non-networked computer with 128KB RAM a 400KB storage device and a dot-matrix printer). It was supported by highly impoverished communication channels between the user and the computer (initially a small black-and-white screen with poor audio output no audio input and no other sensors than the keyboard and a one-button mouse). It was a standalone machine that at most was connected to a printer. Because millennials will constitute 75% of the US workforce within the next ten years software built on outdated principles like the ones above won’t survive. Users simply won’t adopt them. In fact users will reject them outright. How many companies have migrated from on-premise Exchange to Gmail because younger users have demanded that UI? Or Slack instead of email? Or Dropbox instead of a Windows shared drive? Or RelateIQ instead of Salesforce? The vast majority of a millennial user base is dextrous with software. Consequently their expectations of it are much greater. Multiplatform mobile simple and logical UI anticipatory software powered by machine learning. The underlying assumptions of how software should be designed are changing faster and faster. These UX and technology dislocations create a broad new set of opportunity for startups especially bottoms up SaaS startups whose user acquisition strategy usually relies on word of mouth growth. Companies simply can’t have software built on outdated assumptions about users and succeed. Sometimes these assumptions are invalidated suddenly an abrupt discontinuity. The smartphone altered the interactions preferences of hundreds of millions of people in just a few years. Other times the assumptions change more slowly for example with generational changes and like the proverbial boiled frog we are much less likely to be aware of these secular dislocations even if they are just as impactful. Every once in a while it’s worth asking which assumptions does your product have about its users? And how many of them have changed in the last few years? Published 2015-08-06,Published 2015-08-06
http://tomtunguz.com/modeling-fundamental-unit-of-growth/,Modeling Your SaaS Startup's Revenue Growth Effectively,Modeling Your SaaS Startup's Revenue Growth Effectively Once a startup has found an initial product market fit the business must evolve the way it models its growth. Before product market fit a startup’s financial projections focus on costs. The company has no visibility into their revenue growth. So the management team should minimize costs maximize cash and lengthen runway to provide as much time as possible to find that product market fit. As we’ve seen staff are both the greatest asset of a business and also the greatest cost at least initially and modeling those is straightforward. But when a repeatable sales process seems to have been discovered it’s time to develop the startup’s revenue forecast. Revenue forecasts accuracy won’t ever be perfect but they do serve the purpose of communicating to the management team and the board the way a business plans to grow. Additionally and equally importantly revenue forecasts provide a mechanism to articulate how much investment a revenue dollar requires. In other words how much cash investment is required to double or triple or quadruple revenues in the next year. At the core of effective revenue forecasts lie the Fundamental Unit of SaaS Growth. The Fundamental Unit of SaaS growth is the atomic go-to-market team of a startup. For example one Sales Development Rep (SDR) one Account Executive (AE) half of a customer success manager’s (CSM) time. Of course each company’s fundamental unit will vary in composition. When modeling a startup’s growth a team should be asking themselves how many Fundamental Units do we need to hit $1M in ARR $5M in ARR $20M in ARR? How much cash do we need to hire those teams? How much time how many quarters do we need to recruit and train those teams and their managers? The revenue model a startup creates should output two key items: the revenue contribution potential and the associated costs of the company for a year or two in the future. The revenue contribution of a fundamental unit is the MRR the AE/SDR/CS combination produces. As a startup hires more fundamental units the costs increase linearly. But because of the nature of subscription businesses the revenues should increase super-linearly. Conceptualizing a company’s revenue growth in teams rather than individuals recognizes the interdependence of internal teams in SaaS companies for the business to succeed and is one of the most effective ways I’ve seen to model the revenue growth of a SaaS company going to market with sales teams.

http://tomtunguz.com/spending-habits-public-saas/,The Investment Patterns of SaaS Companies in Sales and Engineering Over Time,The Investment Patterns of SaaS Companies in Sales and Engineering Over Time Last week we proved SaaS startups are raising more than they have in the past and newer SaaS companies seem to be generating more revenue per dollar invested. But do newer SaaS companies actually spend less on sales and engineering than their older counterparts? In fact the 2014 cohort of public SaaS companies spend more on sales & marketing and engineering than previous IPO cohorts. But this increased spend results in faster revenue growth and consequent higher revenue. I’ve prepared three charts and one table to compare the sales and engineering spending across different cohorts of companies over time and the resultant effect on revenue growth. The chart above Sales Spend as a % of Revenue and Median Sales Costs depicts the percent of revenue allocated to sales and marketing over the life of the company by IPO cohort. Because startups are going public earlier and therefore release information about the earlier years of the company we have more data on the newer cohorts. While we can’t make comparisons about the early years of startup sales spend across cohorts it’s plain to see that across the past 4 IPO cohorts sales spending eventually converges to about 50%. There’s no clear difference then in sales spending. Looking at the Median Sales Costs which shows gross sales dollars in $M the 2014 cohort does show accelerated spending compared to older cohorts. In combination with the chart above these data points imply that greater sales investments generate more revenue than in the past. The engineering spend story is similar but greater in magnitude. Newer companies have invested substantially more in engineering as a percentage of their revenue than their older counterparts. This may be because larger round sizes enable the creation of larger engineering teams earlier. It may also be because the pace of innovation has increased and fending off competitors means persistently building more products. I’m not sure but the trend is real on a percentage basis as well as on a dollars basis. Looking at the gross dollars invested in engineering the 2014 cohort spends much more than the 2010 2006 and 2002 cohorts setting aside one outlier year in the 2006 cohort. The median spend is about $10M more per year in the 2014 cohort starting in year 6. Summing up these two charts the 2014 cohorts do in fact spend more on sales and marketing than their predecessors and earlier on in their lives. This increased spending is enabled by larger raises earlier in the company lifecycle and actually leads to faster revenue growth as the graph below proves. The 2014 cohort has the steepest most consistent growth curve of any of the cohorts. Leading the way a handful of outliers are adopting increasingly efficient models. Below is a table of the most efficient companies by cohort showing their sales and engineering spend. There seems to be a bumpy but persistent decline. IPO Cohort Minimum Sales Spend % Rev Minimum Eng Spend % Rev 1998 34 11 2002 44 7 2006 41 4 2010 35 8 2014 27 6 The table does show the most efficient company in the 2014 cohort to have spent less on sales than any other IPO cohort winner. But in the 2006 cohort DealerTrack spent only 4% on engineering investment besting the 2014 engineering winner Fleetmatics. In summary the data shows that newer SaaS companies spend more on engineering and sales & marketing than ever before but that increasing efficiency in the sales models can justify that investment with faster revenue growth. The data don’t show us why the increases in spending in sales and engineering result in more revenue but they do suggest that cost per sales is decreasing either because of decreased costs of customer acquisition or increased average contract value or some other reason. In any case the result is quite encouraging. Published 2014-04-15,Published 2014-04-15
http://tomtunguz.com/share-of-as-raise-seed/,What 10x More Seed Capital Means for Founders,What 10x More Seed Capital Means for Founders Today 70% of startups in the US that raise a Series A have raised a seed round. That’s up from 50% ten years ago. In the same period the amount of seed capital invested in the US has increased about 10x from $200M per year to $2B. What does this imply for early stage founders? First it implies greater competition at the Series A. Larger seed rounds enable a seed stage company to achieve more - more growth more revenue more hiring. In addition these larger seed rounds enable successful startups to raises larger series As and the data supports it. The correlation coefficient between seed round size and Series A size in the Crunchbase data set is 0.89 across all startup sectors. That’s not to say there’s a Series A crunch where a surfeit of seed companies are vying for a small pool of Series A capital. Series A volumes have more than doubled in the same period. Instead the competition is about progress. Series A investors expect a company to be further along it its development compared to ten years ago. I hear this in the advice that seed investors provide to SaaS companies. A few years ago startups targeted $50k of MRR before starting their process. Today I hear from founders they aim for at least $80-$100k of MRR before starting conversations when targeting larger Series As. Second the prevalence of seed rounds and the variance in their size has bifurcated the Series A market. There are classic Series As and momentum Series As. Classic Series As of $3-5M are the most common round sizes for startups raising between $0.5M and $2M. Momentum Series As of about $10M follow seed rounds of $4M or more. Of course we can start arguing about semantics: is a $4M round truly a seed? What does Series A really mean today? Series A used to be the first institutional investment in a company but with the rise of institutional seed investors that’s no longer an accurate definition. For founders the difference in wording is an an advantage. A modern Series A company is much larger in staff revenue and achievement than a Series A company from 2005 and consequently conveys a greater sense of momentum and growth rate than its predecessors. Third this greater competition from startups will increasingly come from California and New York both of which have benefitted disproportionately from the seed market boom. The three other top seed geographies Massachussetts Texas and Washington have seen rises  but not the 10x of California and New York. All of this data reinforces the idea that fundraising is an important skill for founders to hone. Managing a company through the right milestones to achieve a strong seed round positions the business for a sizable A and so on - and this is doubly true in a seed bull market.

http://tomtunguz.com/switching-costs/,The Hidden Costs of the Switching Products in the Consumer Web,The Hidden Costs of the Switching Products in the Consumer Web HBS Professor Michael Porter created the Five Forces Framework in 1979 in a landmark book called Competitive Strategy. One of those forces the threat of substitutes has intrigued me for quite a while because in the world of the Internet the prevailing wisdom on switching costs argues they are trivial on the web. After all how difficult is it to change from Google search to Bing search? This is the question Google wrestled with during its search share battle in the mid 00s. In most of the consumer web I’ve come to believe switching costs are significantly greater than I ever suspected. A few months ago I switched my home storage from Dropbox to Google Drive. On the surface the services are identical perhaps differing a bit in price. I thought no switching costs in this market. But transferring the files from Dropbox and uploading them to Google took an entire weekend of file uploads. It was grueling and my wife asked me why I spent all the time to switch for such a tiny gain. Next I replaced Rdio with Spotify. Both services have for all intents and purposes identical content libraries but the user interfaces differ which required learning something new and the playlists didn’t port. I had to rebuild them from scratch. Again time spent for a tiny gain. Switching from one product to another requires effort: the time to learn new software and build new behaviors. This is why so many US businesses still use Excel for their book keeping and Word for everything else. No time investment is required to keep the business going. I’ve been reflecting on this idea of greater actual switching costs in consumer web in the context of Apple’s WWDC announcements. The new products that I suspect will succeed are the ones that reinforce existing behaviors. Connected the software that enables an iPhone to talk to a Mac to receive calls on the Mac transfer work seamlessly across devices and fire up a Wifi hotspot is a good example. I bet many people will use that feature because it reinforces existing behavior. I wonder about the features that require behavior change for no gain. The location sharing feature that competes with Glympse. The ephemeral messaging feature rivaling SnapChat. These match third party software feature for feature but if a customer switches they’ll face the same question my wife asked me. Why spend the time? To entice millions of users to change requires more than copying and convenience. It’s just not enough to reduce the switching costs by creating feature parity. The product has to motivate users to learn something new. Otherwise most people will struggle to justify the time investment which is the hidden and often most important contributor to the switching costs. Published 2014-06-04,Published 2014-06-04
http://tomtunguz.com/startup-key-skills/,The Two Key Skill Sets Startups Must Develop To Grow,The Two Key Skill Sets Startups Must Develop To Grow In “Why Winning Streaks End” Rosabeth Kantar a professor at HBS explains the key to maintaining momentum in any company is maintaining the discipline of every day processes. Similarly Atul Gawande’s book Better echoes this idea. For surgeons the best way to keep patients safe and healthy is ticking through a checklist before each surgery. As I’ve watched a handful of startups grow the pattern I see emerging from most of them is their ability to persistently transform chaos into process. And then continuously improve the way they do things. At the beginning each of these companies pursued product development with something akin to Lean Startup Method. The founders identified a problem spoke with customers and quickly iterated their solution into products the market would buy. After the prototypes were built the founders needed more help building the product and developed a process to hire engineers to grow the development team. Next these companiess shifted into sales and marketing mode pitching and selling potential customers. In so doing they defined and refined their go-to-market process. When the customer acquisition methods were somewhat in place these startup created a third process to recruit salespeople and build a marketing organization. And so on for customer support sales operations human resources finance and every other key activity of a business. Once in place these processes can’t remain static. Processes must stay relevant and productive through persistent improvement. This means using software to instrument processes charging team leaders with the responsibilities to create new ways of doing things and pushing the company towards rapid improvement. For some the word process has a strongly negative connotation. It’s probably because we often notice the processes that don’t work: the line at the DMV the vacation time approval or airplane boarding. While those may need some work we shouldn’t simply throw the baby out with the bathwater and pan all processes. Code check-in regimens hiring procedures OKR setting routines annual reviews - all of these work and to great benefit of the employees teams and company. What was Zynga’s Playbook for launching games if not a list of proprietary processes? Broadly speaking I think this means startups need two skill sets as they grow: the ability to design processes and the ability to maintain/improve/destroy processes as the business evolves.

http://tomtunguz.com/seed-timing/,The Worst Time of Year to Raise A Seed Round,The Worst Time of Year to Raise A Seed Round Has there been optimal time of year to raise a seed round? The chart above shows the number of seed rounds by quarter of the year from 2009-2013. At first blush it would seem that the first quarter of the year is the most attractive period to raise a seed round. But that’s a faulty conclusion. First there’s no statistical difference between the number of rounds raised in each quarter according to a t-test on the four years of Crunchbase data I tested. Second there is a meaningful difference in the size of rounds by quarter. The chart below depicts the mean and median size of seed rounds by quarter. Interestingly seed rounds in Q4 are on average up to 15% larger and in median are up to 60% larger than Q1. The t-test shows a p-value of 0.00012 meaning the difference compared to Q1 is statistically signifcant. But the difference between quarters 2 3 and 4 aren’t material. Digging one level deeper I’ve charted the distribution of seed rounds by investment size below. This data spans the last 4 complete years. Q1 is the least attractive quarter in which to raise a seed round. Of those companies who do raise a round the median and average round size is smaller in Q1. Possible reasons for this trend? I wonder if there isn’t an investor dynamic where investors are more cautious at the beginning of the year and less so at the end. Much like media buyers who look to spend their excess budget at the end of year investors may be looking to hit their dollar investment targets. Secondly there might be some material differences in the time of year that startups are founded which would impact their fund raising timing and change the competitive dynamic during the course of the year. Last it may be a statistical aberration caused by some indeterminate factor in the data. It’s important to note the data doesn’t give us any indication of fundraising success rate. I don’t know how many companies tried to raise and didn’t succeed or the fraction of companies who raised but didn’t achieve their total round size target. That data would help us understand the degree to which competition influences round sizes over the year. On the whole Q1 does seem to yield smaller seed investments than other quarters during the year. Published 2014-05-09,Published 2014-05-09
http://tomtunguz.com/watch-new-platform/,Why Smart Watches Could be a Huge Trend in Mobile,Why Smart Watches Could be a Huge Trend in Mobile Google revealed many novel projects and products at yesterday’s Google IO Conference. At the moment I’m most curious about the development of Android Wear in part because of the beautiful Motorola 360 watch and in part because I suspect connected watches bring substantial change to the mobile device market. It’s easy to write off watches as a niche product. But the addressable market of Android users is now large enough that even a single digit market penetration means tens of millions of users and a potentially interesting new platform for startups to build applications upon. Android counts 1B monthly active users on the platform. A 5% marketshare implies 50M watch users. The total mobile market is now sufficiently large that even niche segments amass substantial user bases. For example phablets phones with 5 inch screens or larger which are frequently scoffed at now represent 21% of Android sales. Additionally watches have the potential to cannibalize fitness tracker sales particularly for the less serious athletes because Motorola’s first watch the Moto 360 has embedded hardware necessary to offer much of the same functionality within the watch. To put that market in context $330M of Fitbits and Nike Fuel bands were sold in 2013 sales or approximately 3M units. Third since the era of Motorola’s RAZR the mobile phone has become a fashion accessory a status symbol. Watches fit naturally into that social dynamic. Moreover watches can be easily customized and changed to meet the demands of many different customer segments: high and low end men and women casual and formal. In some European countries it’s not uncommon to have a utilitarian phone for work and a beautiful phone for the weekend. Why not the same with a watch? Also watches have the potential to change the negative social perception of checking a phone during a meeting or dinner. People do it all the time but it’s impolite. A watch on the other hand permits less obstrusive interruptions. Last the Android Wear software looks incredibly useful exactly what Dick Tracy might have wanted in his 2-way radio. Users can tie voice commands to 3rd party applications like calling an Uber. Speaking to watch is a better UX for a user because it’s faster than pulling a phone from a pocket unlocking it firing up the app selecting your location and then clicking the Dispatch UberX button. This opportunity to tie a voice command to an app creates stickiness for app developers. Smart watches won’t be for everybody but Android Wear and smart watches don’t need to be to grow into an important consumer product and eventually development platform. We’re right on the precipice of a potentially large and interesting new way to enable users to interact with the world. Published 2014-06-26,Published 2014-06-26
http://tomtunguz.com/saas-barriers-to-entry/,The 3 Competitive Defenses of Enduring SaaS Companies,The 3 Competitive Defenses of Enduring SaaS Companies A technology advantage isn’t enough to build an enduring enterprise SaaS company because at the core all SaaS software share the same architecture. A relational database stores data and a web site presents the data. This is true for CRM (Salesforce) marketing automation (Marketo) email (Exchange) content management systems (Sharepoint) and so on. Because SaaS apps use standard databases engineers can easily transfer the data from one database to another. I’m greatly simplifying here because differences in architecture may exist but in principle it’s simple to extract transform and load data from one relational database into another. It may take time to complete the process and users may suffer during the transition but nevertheless roughly 15%+ of every SaaS company’s customers leave each year to a competitor in this way. From Pardot to Eloqua to Marketo to Silverpop. For a few years a technology differentiator like SaaS or mobile might generate sales for an upstart. But time erodes that edge. The first and only SaaS marketing automation company will only lay claim to that title for so long. The three enduring types of competitive advantage for SaaS companies I’ve observed are network effects data network effects and ecosystem creation. Data Network Effects exist when the value of additional data is compounded with time. For example Infer builds predictive scoring models that prioritize leads for sales teams. The more data Infer gathers about a sales team’s customers the better their predictive ability. If a customer switched to a competitor after twelve months the customer would destroy 12 months’ worth of machine learning quite an expensive tradeoff. Network Effects exist in enterprise social networks jut not just any kind of network. Email and chat systems suffer from fungibility. GMail arguably serves an Outlook business just as well. Instead data network effects exist when the SaaS company forges a new network with novel relationships like LinkedIn for recruiting Axial and Angellist for finance Doximity for doctors and so on. Those networks are proprietary and long-lasting competitive barriers to entry. Ecosystem Creation: when a SaaS business surrounds itself with successful partners who serve many different types of customers often not addressed by the SaaS company and reinforce the value of the SaaS product it has employed an ecosystem defense. Salesforce fosters its Force.com ecosystem to further entrench use of its CRM. Veeva a company building pharmaceutical sales software on Salesforce filed for a $150M IPO last month after growing revenues more than 100% y/y. Veeva customizes Salesforce for a particular industry which attracts and retains customers better than Salesforce could. More Veeva sales means more revenue to Salesforce. Similarly Microsoft has a vibrant created vendor ecosystems that sells customizes and services their products. Not every SaaS business needs one of these three defensive strategies to succeed. In fact many SaaS businesses never do create one. But I think the truly great ones do. Published 2013-10-01,Published 2013-10-01
http://tomtunguz.com/app-store-dynamics/,The Data Behind Why Google’s Play Is So Much Harder For Startups To Crack Than the iOS App Store,The Data Behind Why Google’s Play Is So Much Harder For Startups To Crack Than the iOS App Store As the number of Android users continues approach 1B devices more and more startups are looking to deploy complementary applications on Android in addition to their iOS applications. Some startups are beginning looking to launch on Android first. But the dynamics of the Android app store are quite different from iOS. In fact they are much more challenging for startups. Like iOS’s app store Android’s app store also ranks applications. But the ranking system is very different in four key ways: TL/DR Android seems to tune/control the charts to encourage fewer large movements of applications within the rankings than iOS. The rankings aren’t wholly calculated from the previous hour’s downloads like iOS. As a result it’s much harder for new entrants to break into the top of the charts on Android than iOS. Existing top applications are much better insulated from competitors than with Apple. But the decreased volatility means paid customer acquisition is much more cost-effective on Android presuming the app’s engagement and monetization are similar across platforms because if your app can reach the top of the charts it’s much less likely to be dethroned and the cost-per-install of the paid users can be amortized over a much larger organic user base who discovers the app by virtue of the high rank. The competitive categories vary significantly from Android to iOS. This means there is probably an arbitrage opportunity to bring the best apps from iOS to Android. To tell the real story behind climbing these app stores I’ve been gathering ranking data from the app stores for the past two weeks. Android Ranking Movements are Much More Subtle than Apple In a given day the average iOS app could move up to 50 ranks up or down. The typical Android app moves up to 12 slots. Below are two charts comparing the variances of all applications on each store in a two week window. An average iOS application might vary by fifty to one hundred ranks or more in a two week period. On the other hand the same application on Android wouldn’t see more than a 50 rank fluctuation. Volatility Difference is Pretty Consistent No Matter Your App Rank Now you might point out that apps in the lower ranks (200-300) should move much more than those apps in the top 10. Perhaps that explains the difference between Android and iOS. But that’s not true. iOS has larger variances at every rank bucket. Compare these two charts that show the variance of applications that reached rank 10 50 100 and 200 at some point during my test. Android apps tend to stay put where they are much more than iOS no matter if they are ranked three thirty or three hundred. Competitive Categories Below is one way of looking at competitiveness by category for each of these app charts. The more the average application can change rank within a category the better the quality of competition exists (perfect competition in the economic sense). Where variances are low there is something like an oligopoly - for example ten apps that dominate the top ten. Click on the images to enlarge them. iOS most oligopolistic categories are Catalogs Social Networking Photo & Video and Food & Drink. The easiest categories to enter are Sports Weather Lifestyle and News. On the other hand Android’s most oligopolistic categories are Arcade & Action Games Tools Shopping and Racing Games. The best categories for new entrants are News Medical Finance Business. What Got You Here Won’t Get You There Android’s market isn’t a carbon copy of Apple’s. Android requires a distinct strategy considering the much stronger tendencies to reinforce the top applications within Google Play. There are many drawbacks for startups when launching on Android but the addressable market may ultimately render those challenges moot. Data Caveats With any analysis there should be lots of caveats This is a two week study with a sample size of about 25k applications and roughly 1 data point per app per day for 14 days. - Android may seem to have a less accessible app store because they are fewer quality apps and so the best bubble to the top and stay there. I can’t make a determination either way with this data. - Looking at standard deviations and variances implies that the underlying data follow a Gaussian distribution and these data may not.

Based in San Diego ServiceNow employs roughly 3000 people and sells a system of record for IT operations teams to manage IT assets facilities and human resources. ServiceNow’s software allows clients to develop custom applications for their own needs often with the help of the company’s professional services team. The business was founded in 2004 but hit its stride 2009 and went public in 2012. ServiceNow grew from$19M in revenue to $178M in 4 years sustaining a 75% CAGR during that period. Compared to other SaaS companies ServiceNow is among the top 3 fastest growing and isn’t showing any signs of slowing. At IPO ServiceNow recorded a $95000 average revenue per customer placing in the top third of SaaS companies in terms of average revenue per customer. But that figure has increased dramatically over the past four years. Since 2011 the average revenue of a ServiceNow customer has expanded to $250000 on average. This figure has grown by 27% per year. ServiceNow has moved up-market aggressively nearly tripling the number of million-dollar-plus customers from 37 to 129 in the last three years. In addition the company has grown its base of customers substantially. ServiceNow reports its upsell rate which is equivalent to a negative net churn. ServiceNow commands 30%+ annual price increases from its customers an impressive figure. This ability to upsell and cross sell customers has benefited the company tremendously. ServiceNow has recorded a better than 1.0 sales efficiency for every year on record but 2014. amazingly the company was able to achieve an estimated sales efficiency of 1.8 at $93M in revenue. Impressively the company is investing more and more into engineering - exceeding 20% of revenues last year - likely developing broader feature set to enable additional up and cross sells. Gross margins hover in the 60s which is about 10 percentage points lower than the median. Software margins are roughly 80% while the professional services team which comprises about 14% of revenue operates at negative -17% gross margin. ServiceNow has mostly operated unprofitably investing as much capital as it can into growth. But that’s not to say the business isn’t very capital efficient. The company raised less than $90 million before IPO. And in fact ServiceNow has generated positive operating cash flow for every year but 2010. Although not that well known ServiceNow is a business to be studied. The company has grown exceptionally quickly using the median amount of capital developed a superbly efficient sales and up selling playbook all while being cash flow breakeven.

http://tomtunguz.com/on-being-disrupted/,How the NYTimes avoided disruption,How the NYTimes avoided disruption Over the weekend I watched Page One a documentary which chronicles the turmoil occurring within the New York Times in 2009 and 2010 when newspapers were going out of business all over the country. Many wondered if the Times would also file for bankruptcy. Three confluent factors spelled imminent demise for the newspaper: the Internet cannibalized subscription revenue advertising dollars evaporated and news distribution was in upheaval on account of Wikileaks Twitter and blogs. The scale of these shifts was enormous: advertising revenue had crashed to 1950 levels eliminating five decades of growth in just a few years. Impressively the New York Times has survived the crisis. Although the company’s value has declined by 75% the Gray Lady generates about $1.3B in revenue and is profitable. 10% of revenues originate from digital subscriptions evidence the paper is mastering a new art form - making money on the web. Every company faces challenges in its history. The New York Times' struggle depicted in this movie highlighted some wonderful lessons on how to handle these crises. First the management of the company reaffirmed their core values. The editor Tom Bodkin spoke to his team pledging to maintain the top quality journalism and a commitment to truth the Times had always championed. Second the management team reduced its staff to a sustainable level. The anguish is plain to see both in employees and the management team but it was essential to make these hard choices. Third Bodkin and his team embraced the transformation of the industry pursuing technology advances and pushing the journalistic envelope with the goal of restoring the brand of the Times as the vanguard of journalism. In terms of technology the company built an iPad application hired a new group in the research and development team to focus on digital advertising products and launched a content paywall. Each of these initiatives faced criticism In terms of journalism the Times adapted to new information sources and writers. The Times published Wikileaks documents supplied by Julian Assange associating their old guard brand with a new form of activism/journalism - a very controversial move both internally and externally. In addition the company hired a handful of young bloggers to incorporate a disruptive medium into their product. Since 2009 the NY Times has created more than 40 successful blogs. These bold actions which respected the core values of the company saved the NYTimes from irrelevance. The movie does present a very idealistic and one sided view of the company and the nuances of managing through a crisis like this are much more challenging than I may have made them appear in this summary but the big blocks of strategy championed by the movie and undertaken by the management are worth highlighting. By plunging the company into the new form of media understanding the industry changes and becoming agents of change themselves the Timesmen were able to save the business during a great crisis avoiding irrelevance and disruption by embracing innovation. Today the NYTimes remains at the forefront of journalism and will for many years. Published 2012-09-04,Published 2012-09-04

Having worked in three hypergrowth companies Bill is an expert in building massively successful marketing teams. These are the five kernels of wisdom I learned last night. When is the right time to hire a head of marketing? The right time to hire a head of marketing for your startup is when the company has found product market fit. Marketing amplifies a message but rarely do marketing teams ignite the fire. Which marketing disciplines should the marketing team build first? After a startup hires a head of marketing the operations and analytics team should be the first of the nine marketing disciplines to hire. After all in order to understand which marketing techniques work a startup must be well instrumented to measure variances across experiments. Next the marketing team should begin experimenting with paid acquisition understanding the relationship between paid customers and organic traction and whether they are linked. Which marketing metrics are most important? One metric that most SaaS marketers don’t measure frequently but should is Net Promoter Score. NPS measures the likelihood of customers to recommend the product. Best in class companies achieve a score of 70 on a scale of 100 but according to Zendesk data the typical B2B software company achieves only 29. NPS is a leading indicator of future growth. The larger the number of advocates for product the lower the customer acquisition costs for the company and the more effective customer success team will be. How does a startup determine its price? Bill shared a unique point of view on this question. The price a software startup can charge is a function of the difference in net promoter score between that startup and its competition. In other words a startup with a very high promoter score compared to the competition can charge a premium in the market and vice versa. High promoter scores indicate great product market fit good customer relationships and substantial value creation all of which translate into pricing power When if ever should we verticalize our marketing message? Often horizontal SaaS products like Salesforce which serve customers across many different industries are tempted to verticalize their marketing message. In other words to create marketing materials websites white papers and other collateral that are focused on the specific industry. While conceptually this makes sense marketing complexity explodes. Instead of having one message to disseminate a marketing team now must manage 5 to 10 different messages for each of the verticals they seek to address. While this can be done it requires us very large marketing team. For startups it’s often much more effective to focus on the common attributes of customers and market based on those. Needless to say Bill shared some terrifically useful and tactical insights with us. Thank you Bill! At the next SaaS Office hours we’ll welcome Kenny van Zant former COO of Asana and SVP at Solarwinds to talk about flywheel business models. Stay tuned for more details.

http://tomtunguz.com/twitter-new-communication_type/,The First Form of Communication that Changes Depending on Who is Using It,The First Form of Communication that Changes Depending on Who is Using It Twitter is the first form of communication that changes depending on who is using it. Like the telephone the fax email Twitter enables all types of communications: friendly banter customer support requests news syndication and public service announcements to name a few. But Twitter imposes a three new wrinkles that set it apart as a new form of communication. First the recipients of a tweet are knowable but never really known. One could sift through a list of Twitter followers but never understand who they are if they pay attention to tweets why they follow an account or what agenda they have. Followers might include close friends business acquaintances customers strangers and Justin Bieber - or any combination. Second a user’s experience with Twitter changes based upon their following. Sending a tweet falls somewhere along the continuum of yelling into the woods when no one else is around practicing Shakespeare in a crowded public park or stumping on stage in front of 100000 people in the audience with a microphone in hand. A Twitter user’s follower count molds his Twitter experience. Third Twitter is the only communication form that doesn’t require systematic processing of messages. Most of us respond to email SMS voice mail and phone calls with dogmatic diligence. In the Twitter stream users are panning for gold balancing signal and noise in a much more equal quantities than voicemail. Missing a few thousand tweets doesn’t really matter. These three properties of Twitter enable users to bend and shape their experiences as they wish. It’s this plasticity that makes Twitter such a novel communication platform. We each have to learn how to use it as we use it. Published 2013-11-07,Published 2013-11-07
http://tomtunguz.com/twitter-analytics/,Four lessons for optimizing Twitter,Four lessons for optimizing Twitter Over the weekend I analyzed my Twitter performance over the past 4 weeks. I wanted to determine what if any best practices I could tease from the data. Below are my four conclusions: The best time for me to tweet is 9am Pacific. On average tweets at 9am generate 2.3 times the number of clicks as those in the 8am hour and 3.3 times those of the 12pm (lunch) hour. Below is a chart of number of clicks per tweet by hour of the day: Each retweet is worth about 9 clicks. My median tweet receives 24 clicks and the average tweet receives 36 clicks. So the first retweet drives a 25 to 33% increase in clicks. Below is a chart of tweets (marked by red dots) plotted by the number of reactions/retweets and clicks. The blue line is the linear trendline. Users with huge follower counts send tweets into the stratosphere. There is a step function apparent in the data. If one of my tweets is retweeted by @hnshah with 80k followers I instantly receive twice the clicks. The chart below plots the reach of each tweet by the number of clicks. The ideal tweet the one generating the most clicks is between 40 to 70 characters long and sent between 8:30 and 9:30am. I use timely.is to programmatically send tweets out at the optimal times of the day. You can see from this analysis that tools like these don’t seem to provide much value aside from scheduling. Below is a chart of tweets by time of day (y-axis) and tweet length (x-axis) with the number of clicks indicated by the size of the bubble. My most successful tweet generated about 190 clicks. It was sent at 9:21 am and had 46 characters. NB: I don’t send many long tweets so there is a data bias. Summary stats Below are stats describing my tweets in a bit more detail. The key conclusion is that the upper bound outliers the really successful tweets skew averages much higher than medians - this is the viral effect in action. Clicks Reach Retweets Tweet Length Average 37 11882 2 65 Median 24 3825 1 61 Published 2012-10-08,Published 2012-10-08
http://tomtunguz.com/make-your-demo-great/,Demo to term sheet in 3 hours,Demo to term sheet in 3 hours I met the Electric Imp team in April. I had bumped into one of their engineers at a party and he pinged me a few weeks later to say he was working for a startup and the company was raising. The company came in to the office on a Monday at noon. Hugo the founder Electric Imp demoed their product to me. Ten minutes in I stopped the pitch meeting pulled 3 partners from their Monday partner meeting and issued a term sheet that afternoon. The demo was just that compelling. Electric Imp’s demo had three key parts: A simple and clear story line that the audience related to describing how a user might use their product to solve a problem and improve their lives. A beautiful product that inspires. Though the software was raw the hardware and software worked together flawlessly and everyone in the room had a clear picture of the way the technology could change the world. Well practiced delivery. Smooth crisp and clear. Clearly this process is an exception. But great demos close customers investors and candidates because they sell the dream. Invest in your demo - they embody the vision passion and aspiration of the company. Published 2012-10-24,Published 2012-10-24
http://tomtunguz.com/quick-idea-validation/,Quick and Dirty Product/Market Fit Validation: Can You Hit Your Quota?,Quick and Dirty Product/Market Fit Validation: Can You Hit Your Quota? How do you validate an idea for a software startup before the product is built? Last week a founder of a SaaS business and I were wrestling with this problem. It’s a question without a universal answer. After a while we came up with quick and dirty rule of thumb for his business. Can he hit his quota? Suppose this founder wasn’t the founder but the first inside sales hire for the startup. His annual quota would be around $300k or about $25k per month. He would likely commit to a four month quota ramp needing to reach of 25% of quota ($6k) in the first month 50% in the second ($12k) and so on. With his mockups/demo in hand and given 30 days could he sell $6k worth of vaporware and become confident of achieving his second month’s quota? Would customers agree to buy the product at the target price if it were built? This quota test is a harsh one. Most inside sales reps arrive with a sales script warm leads a known sales path and a working product. For founders none of this exists. Founders start from scratch. Despite its severity I think there are five benefits to this approach: The quota test demands the team understand and identify potential customers contact them and establish initial pricing - aka getting out of the office and validating the idea. The quota test prepares the team for eventually building inside saless because the founders will know from experience what it takes to sell the product. The wireframes sales process unearths missing features that block product adoption (eg integrations with other software compliance stability SaaS vs. on-prem) and surfaces other customer objections (eg long term contracts with competitors politics etc.) Should the team succeed in the quota test the startup will have established that an inside sales model is a viable growth strategy for the company. The sales funnel data is a tremendous asset during fund-raising because it establishes customers’ willingness to pay reference customers and some basic sales funnel metrics. This test isn’t for every software business. The quota test doesn’t work for freemium businesses who acquire individual users to gin up leads with the aim of converting a department or company later; nor for network effect businesses whose value can only be experienced after critical mass is established; nor for businesses who will never build inside sales teams. But it is a tactic worth adding to the product/market fit toolkit for software ideas. What other tactics have you found to validate product/market fit? Tweet me.

http://tomtunguz.com/best-funnel-visualization/,The Most Effective Way of Visualizing Funnels,The Most Effective Way of Visualizing Funnels I first learned about Sankey diagrams in my thermodynamics class and they’ve since become one of my favorite data visualizations and analysis tools. Sankey diagrams like the one above of visitors to this blog show the flow of things. Originally created for measuring the flow of energy through powerplants they are incredibly useful for content marketing analysis visitor analysis or any other kind of funnel analysis. The best Sankey diagram ever created is Charles Joseph Minard’s depiction of the Napoleonic War which was made famous in Edward Tufte’s Book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. It’s amazing because there are at least five different dimensions of data displayed in an intelligible way. Try that with any other chart. I use Sankey diagrams to understand how people navigate through this blog. At the bottom of this page I’ve created a Read This Next box. Google Analytics’ Sankey diagram showing user behavior is the most intuitive way I’ve found of understanding and measuring the impact of that feature. To see your GA Sankey diagram click the Behavior tab then the Behavior Flow tab from the Google Analytics home screen. You’ll see a chart like the one above. When I log in I look first at the 1st interaction to see the breakdown of how people arrive at my blog. Next I want to understand how they navigate the site. By looking at the patterns for each subsquent interaction I can get a sense and by tallying the page views in each of the first eight interactions I know that the Read This Next Feature increases page views by 10% in total. More importantly for engaged users (those who click on at least one more page) Read This Next doubles page views. Last the Read This Next Feature drives 10.5x the number of page views as the previous/next buttons on the index page and 128% more traffic than the home page link at the top of the page. Sankey diagrams can be applied in sales conversion funnels to understand how efficient teams are in closing customers and where in the process the most effective improvements can be made. They can be used to understand customer lifetimes upgrade cycles. Properly applied Sankey diagrams provide deep insight into longitidinual patterns. Give them a try the next time you’re tempted to employ a funnel. The two best ways I’ve found of creating Sankey diagrams are D3’s Sankey toolkit by Michael Bostock (which can also be done in Excel) and RCharts in R; but there are many ways.

http://tomtunguz.com/what-is-a-patents-worth-to-a-startup/,The value of a patent to a startup,The value of a patent to a startup For Fortune 500 companies patents can be offensive and defensive weapons generating billions of dollars worth of royalty and licensing revenues. …if someone at Apple can dream it up then we should apply for a patent because even if we never build it it’s a defensive tool” Nancy R. Heinen Apple’s former general counsel The Patent as a Sword: But startups shouldn’t approach patents the same way large companies do. Instead founders should view patents as downside protection - an asset to be valued during a fire-sale of the business. For startups patents are specious barriers-to-entry. Unlike large corporate patent owners who wield patents in defense of their businesses founders can’t afford to enforce patents. Startups simply don’t have the legal budgets to bankroll lengthy legal processes. Vlingo fought Nuance for 3 years in court to defend their patents - only to win a Pyrrhic victory. The legal battle exhausted the company’s assets and Vlingo sold to Nuance a short while later for the value of the patents. File your patent mention it on a pitch deck slide and then tuck it in your back pocket as a trump card to play when your startup has amassed the legal war chest to enforce it.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-struggle/,Honest cultures in startups,Honest cultures in startups This morning NPR profiled an education researcher comparing and contrasting the way different cultures approach intelligence and learning in schools. Though the debate about education methodologies is fascinating I found the one of the stories in the report reminded me of the importance of transparent cultures in startups. In 1979 Jim Stigler a researcher from UMich went to study education in Japan. Sitting in the back of a fourth grade math class he watched as the teacher asked the class to draw cubes. The teacher selected the student who was having the greatest difficulty drawing the cube to go to the blackboard and struggle in front of the class as his classmates critiqued his work periodically. As the student tried again and again to draw a cube Jim grew anxious - as many of us might. By the end of the class the the student drew a cube properly and stood in front of the classroom with great pride. His classmates applauded him. I admire startup cultures that prioritize transparency and reward struggle because these companies value learning. Very few companies have direct and unwavering paths to market. Most of them have to bob and weave pivot and rebuild. The team that can identify their challenges test their assumptions understand the problems and respond the fastest will ultimately be the team which wins the market. The first component to such a company is a culture of honest and straightforward feedback. The second component is a team which is willing to support each other through their each respective struggles to learn how best to serve the company. Every startup will struggle. Building a transparent and honest environment is the key to transforming struggle into progress - like drawing a cube on blackboard with classmates watching.

http://tomtunguz.com/payback_period_cash/,The Importance of Payback Period for SaaS Startups,The Importance of Payback Period for SaaS Startups One of the most powerful levers for SaaS companies to master is payback period. Payback period is the number of months a company requires to payback its cost of customer acquisition. The median SaaS startup has a payback period of 15 months on a gross margin basis. A short payback period confers two massive advantage to a startups: smaller working capital requirements and a consequent ability to grow much faster. Let’s take a hypothetical example of a SaaS company at $625k in ARR growing at 15% per month. The company has 25 customers each paying $25000 and operates with an 80% gross margin. The company bills monthly. The chart above shows the amount of working capital tied up in customer acquisition as a function of payback period. If the company can achieve a 12 month payback period $7.8M of the company’s cash will be tied up in customer acquisition. On the other hand if the company achieves a six month payback only $2.6M of working capital is required to achieve this growth rate freeing $5.2M for other initiatives. The company could take this “extra” $5.2M and recycle it by hiring more sales and marketing teams to grow faster. Compared to the 15% baseline growth at 12 months payback at six months payback the company can achieve a 20% compound monthly growth rate. Instead of exiting month 12 at an $2.7M ARR the business would be at $4.5M run rate. Of course as a company scales its customers acquisition efforts the payback period is sure to fluctuate and effect the working capital and growth characteristics of the business. However those companies that achieve shorter payback periods can influence their growth rates much more effectively than companies with longer payback periods. As for companies who charge their customers for an annual subscription and annual prepay the math is similar but the magnitude of the difference between the shorter and longer growth rates is muted relative to monthly payment because the company will receive all of its customer acquisition cost back (in all but the 15 month case) up front. These two advantages of shorter payback periods provide tremendous leverage to the business to manage for growth or efficiency and consequently investors are attracted to those companies. This math underscores why customer acquisition efficiency is so compelling. Published 2015-09-21,Published 2015-09-21
http://tomtunguz.com/the-dynamics-of-the-seed-market-in-2013/,The Five Key Dynamics of the Seed Market in 2013,The Five Key Dynamics of the Seed Market in 2013 Last night I spoke at the Enterprise Tech VC Panel. We discussed five trends in the seed market and the outlook for 2013. These are the five most important trends for 2013 in my view. MicroVC Funds Have Doubled Their Assets Call it micro-VC or mega-seed fund there’s a new investor class which raises funds between $50 and $100M to invest in seed-stage companies. Felicis manages a $70M fund Jeff Clavier at Softech invests from a $55M fund and Steve Anderson of Baseline has raised at two funds totaling $100M. These seed investors invest larger amounts than before (both initially and during follow-on rounds) and invest in more startups. Seed Round Sizes Have Ballooned In 2008 when I first started in venture a$500k seed was sizable. A $1M seed turned heads. Today those amounts are routine if small. In the past year micro-VCs have doubled the capital they invest each year to $1.6B. In addition traditional VCs also have continued to participate actively in the seed market. As a result of these two pools of capital entering the market seed rounds are approaching Series A sizes. Lacking accurate census data to illustrate the trend I’ll use an extreme case to prove the point: Virool raised $6.6M last week in a “party” seed round. CrowdFunding and MarketPlaces Bring New Viable Forms Of Seed Capital No one can argue with the success of fund raising campaigns on KickStarter and Indiegogo. Ouya effectively raised a $8.6M Series A in the form of early orders on Kickstarter. In addition to crowdsourcing sites Angelist (in partnership with SecondMarket) and FundersClub attract $1k+ investment sizes from non-traditional angels looking for exposure to startups. As a friend pointed out to me it all feels a bit like the 1999 bubble when everyone can and wants to invest in a dot-com. Instead of using the public markets to buy shares private markets have blossomed to meet this demand. Mezzanine Seed Funds Have Entered The Market You don’t often hear the word mezzanine in the valley. It’s much more common in private equity conversations. But with the boom in seed investments driven by the capital flooding the asset class mezzanine seed funds have taken root. Mezz seed funds target startups who have raised a seed round but haven’t been able to achieve the milestones to attract a Series A investment. So they seek a second seed round a mezzanine seed round for a bit more runway and a second chance to raise an A. Rising Labor Costs Increase Burn But Fuel The Acquihire Trend As infrastructure costs plummet labor costs are soaring because of a talent supply/demand imbalance. These labor costs require larger seed rounds to achieve the same runway. In fact for most of Redpoint’s portfolio companies labor is the single biggest line item on the P&L. On the other side of the coin the overwhelming demand for top talent drives the acquihire market. Every major technology company has a talent acquisition strategy based on M&A. Acquisitions by FB GOOG YHOO EBAY and others provide a landing place for struggling seed companies looking for strategic options and a non-zero return for investors. The New Bull Market The seed market feels like a bull market: lots of capital rushing in new asset classes being created and a ton of opportunity for entrepreneurs looking for some early capital to change the world.

http://tomtunguz.com/google-reader/,Social Proof: The Most Formidable Force Driving Content,Social Proof: The Most Formidable Force Driving Content In a world of socially curated news there is no place for RSS. I wrote last year: Social streams solve the problem most RSS readers faced: the inbox with 1000+ items to read and no way to sift through them. Socially curated news syndicated through social networks (Facebook Twitter) and content networks (LinkedIn Quibb HackerNews) solves the relevance problem that RSS never could address. Brian Shih former Google Reader PM wrote an excellent passionate post-mortem on the product on Quora where he underscores the importance of the social forces at play on Google Reader. I think the reason Google always wanted to pull the Reader team off to build these other social products was that the Reader team actually understood social … But after switching the sharing features over to G+ (the so called “share-pocalypse”) along with the redesigned UI my guess is that usage just started to fall - particularly around sharing. To succeed as a content producer or as a content consumption product embracing and mastering social proof and sharing is critical. Ignore these forces at your peril. Google Reader wasn’t the first to fall at the hands of social distribution nor will it be the last. Unless Google Reader is wholly reinvented with social proof and sharing at its core any effort to extend Google Reader’s life is only a temporary stay of execution.

http://tomtunguz.com/top-250-it-companies/,The Technology Sectors that Create the Most Value,The Technology Sectors that Create the Most Value In which sectors have software companies created the most financial value? I asked myself this question over the weekend. I categorized the top 250 IT companies which spans $675B in market cap (AAPL) to $3B in market cap (ASOS) and created the chart above. B2B Software which includes Microsoft Oracle IBM and SAP among others represents about 30% of the total IT market cap today. The consumer web (GOOG FB Baidu eBay) is second at 20% of market cap. Semiconductors and Consumer Hardware (led by Apple) tie at 17% each. Most of these very valuable companies are older than I thought. Below I’ve plotted the year of founding of each of these 250 companies. 13% of the top 250 IT companies today were founded before 1950. On the other hand companies founded since 2000 account for 19% of the stock tickers but only 10% of the market cap. In other words these younger newer companies are smaller on average. Aside from being a great decade for music and fashion the 1980s saw the founding of today’s largest IT companies with a median of $9.3B in market cap across 24 companies including AAPL ORCL MSFT SAP and EMC. Over the next ten years I suspect we’ll see the next generation of B2B Software companies rise to the same levels of market caps as these big names. The opportunity to replace these companies’ aging technologies is simply massive. Let’s break these trends down by sector as a proxy for innovation rate. Not surprisingly the most valuable Consumer Web companies have all been founded after the invention and widespread adoption of the internet. B2B Software is also witnessing rapid innovation with big companies built in the last 10-20 years which supports the idea that we’ll see some huge SaaS businesses in the future. In contrast Financial Services hasn’t seen a new $3B+ company created in a while indicating there’s likely quite a bit of opportunity here. LendingClub’s pending IPO will change this to a certain degree. B2B Software will remain the biggest category by market cap for a long time implying there are huge opportunities there for new SaaS startups to disrupt. Published 2014-12-08,Published 2014-12-08
http://tomtunguz.com/the-developer-economy-power-to-the-coders/,The Developer Economy: Power to the Coders,The Developer Economy: Power to the Coders During the past week I’ve been tapping out letters on a 1921 Underwood portable typewriter that my wife gave me as a present. Sitting in front of it and watching the letter hammers pound ink onto paper reminded me that computer programming is still a very new field. Not 50 years ago prehistoric programmers punched FORTRAN code on punch cards in this way. In the past 10 to 15 years has computer programming entered mainstream culture and the number of developers has soared popularized by the dot com era and the increasing prevalence of computers and mobile phones. With the increase in developer numbers new opportunities have arisen to build sizable businesses serving programmers. Despite developers' reputation for miserly resourcefulness a handful of companies have built substantial businesses serving programmers. Rally and Atlassian promote agile software development techniques with workflow software. Rally filed its IPO documents earlier this year and Atlassian is sure to follow. Splunk which generates enormous revenues from its log analysis platform also went public. Of course this is to say nothing of the multibillion-dollar business Amazon has built providing infrastructure to developers. Moreover the developer ecosystem has become strategic to cash-rich monoliths. Facebook acquired mobile app development platform Parse to attract and retain mobile application developers for Facebook’s benefit. Salesforce bought Heroku a software development and deployment platform to complement Force.com Salesforce’s very successful application market place. In both of these instances and in the cases of the mobile phone wars between Apple Google and Microsoft programmers are the essential component to building vibrant application ecosystems and lasting competitive advantage. 10 years ago it would’ve been easy to write off the developer community has an isolated and small constituency. But not today. Github just announced 4M user accounts. This boom in web developers and database engineers and user experience designers provides tremendous opportunity for startups to seize.

http://tomtunguz.com/burnout/,The Antidote to Burnout is Progress,The Antidote to Burnout is Progress Andrew Dumont wrote about his grueling schedule at a startup and the lessons on “Avoiding Burnout” which spurred a torrent of comments on HackerNews. For me the most interesting comment is this one by Daniel Ribeiro who quotes Isaac Yonemoto: Burnout is caused when you repeatedly make large amounts of sacrifice and or effort into high-risk problems that fail…You effectively condition your brain to associate work with failure… The best way to prevent burnout is to follow up a serious failure with doing small things that you know are going to work. Burnout is a motivation problem a listlessness a defeatist attitude and perhaps even a hopelessness triggered by the lack of progress. I suspect burnout is much more pronounced for information workers - people who deal in bits each day - because unlike a mason or an architect the product of much of our work isn’t visible. Even the tools we use virtual to do lists and email hide the work we’ve completed: tasks checked off and emails sent. Reading through Andrew’s advice on managing burnout the common theme is seeking progress in life (exercise walks small wins hobbies diet). All these habits are hedges - each one offers a guaranteed little bit of progress each day. Coincidentally NPR profiled a productivity researcher from HBS this morning. According to her research the most important driver of productivity is motivation which aligns with Daniel’s comment. Her recommendation for improving motivation? Use tools like IDoneThis to track what you’ve accomplished each day and take the time now and again to reflect on your progress through that journey. At Google we had an internal product called Snippets which is functionally identical to IDoneThis. I’d always believed the purpose of Snippets was to improve communication across a team and company about the contributions of employees. But perhaps I missed the more important benefit: motivation management and burnout prevention. We all need to feel like we’re making progress and simple tools like these bits of software and exercise diet reading and Andrew’s other suggestions are part of the antidote to burnout.

R the open source statistics language is about a third as popular as Ruby and growing fast. Statistics are essential because data is ubiquitous and volumes are growing exponentially even in startups. CEOs measure key company metrics. Engineers measure application performance and build machine learning models. Marketers measure campaign performance and reach. PMs measure engagement. And so on. A basic knowledge of statistics has become essential for most roles in business and for most companies I think it’s worth sending most employees to a statistics course because understanding the relationships across data is the determinant of success. More information implies better analysis means better decisions. Venture capital is no different. I spend quite a lot of time with R these days. I’ve written about how I use these for business development. Also I manage portfolio company performance data publicly available data like trending applications on the app store. And so on. If a relationship business like venture capital can benefit from statistics imagine the impact to a performance oriented startup.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-marketing-spend/,The Sales and Marketing Spend Strategies of Billion Dollar SaaS Companies,The Sales and Marketing Spend Strategies of Billion Dollar SaaS Companies How much should your SaaS startup spend on sales and marketing? I’ve written about using unit economics and lead funnel performance to answer this question. Emulating the patterns of successful SaaS companies is another technique. There are about 34 publicly traded SaaS companies that have published their revenue and sales & marketing expenses. Though their revenue growth rates are each unique the sales and marketing spend patterns are quite similar. The revenue ramps of public SaaS companies follow the familiar exponential growth path. But their rates of growth vary quite a bit. Some companies' revenue ramps are more pronounced than others. LinkedIn is the most vertical of these reaching nearly $1B of revenue in 10 years while Kenexa and Vocus needed 25 years to reach $200M-$300M in revenue. Despite these varied revenue trends the sales and marketing spends as a fraction of revenue are remarkably similar. The chart below depicts Sales and Marketing Spend by Year / Revenue for each company. There seems to be a pattern. Running a smoothing algorithm over the data reveals the trend. In the first 3 years these public SaaS companies spend between 80 to 120% of their revenue in sales and marketing (using venture dollars or other forms of capital to finance the business). By year 5 that ratio has fallen to about 50% where it remains for the life of the business. Despite the divergent revenue ramps the marketing and sales spend patterns for these companies resemble each other strongly and serve as good benchmarks for high-growth SaaS startups. In case you’re curious below is the “typical” revenue growth trajectory for these SaaS companies: $50M in year five $100M in year ten. Notes on the analysis: Clearly survivorship biases the data significantly. Small sample sizes (n=30) mean the variance in the data is high. Published 2013-08-26,Published 2013-08-26
http://tomtunguz.com/continuing-education-picasso/,The Most Important Investment a Startup Can Make,The Most Important Investment a Startup Can Make Yesterday I spoke to a small group of people at Google. By coincidence the presentation was held in the same building I used to work in and a wave of nostalgia swept over me. Participating in Google’s speaker series brought back memories of when I was in the audience seven or eight years ago. I’ll never forget the first time I met Paul Graham in that very same room right after the first Startup School. Nor the crash-course on negotiation I took when we were negotiating with Facebook and MySpace. Nor the management class on having difficult conversations with colleagues among countless others. Returning to Google reminded me that great companies constantly invest in their people helping them to understand the world inside the company and outside the company. Coincidentally in this week’s New York Times Brian Chen writes about the Apple’s University which teaches Apple employees about typical topics like company’s history and structure but also delves into much more strategic concepts like effective communication and Apple’s unique design processes. So serious is Apple about their University that Jobs hired the dean from Yale’s School of Management to oversee the initiative. Chen writes about Pablo Picasso’s influence on the school. The photo above depicts Picasso’s progressive reduction when drawing a bull starting from an intricate and muscular animal to a sketch of only seven lines. It’s one of many tools used to teach Apple’s design ethos. As Chen points out Picasso’s progression is echoed in the evolution of Apple’s mouse which started as a ten-sided brick with a button today is a single piece of curved plastic. Apple University is a competitive advantage. Apple commands 6x the operating margin of its competitors because of its design and marketing prowess. After leaving Google I discovered startups are more open and collaborative with their learning than most large companies. At conferences events and coffee meetings startup founders and employees freely share many of the insights into product design marketing customer success and engineering best practices. One could argue the entire open-source movement is a giant continuing education program for software engineers. This fast-paced knowledge sharing is a key part of what makes Silicon Valley such a hotbed of innovation. It’s wonderful that massively profitable public companies can make these investments. But how should founders incorporate these ideas into their startups? Most early stage startups can’t afford the expense in time or capital to create education programs. But they can fund continuing employee education on a smaller scale the form of sales training marketing workshops guest speakers management coaching. In the current recruiting environment I expect this type of perk is be a strong selling point to prospective employees and a powerful retention tool. I think most people who have been through similar program will attest it’s an amazing feeling when your company and manager invests in your personal success in this way. The loyalty engendered is hard to overstate. As a startup grows and scales it’s easy to forget about deepening employee education. But the enrichment both in knowledge and network building is invaluable. Furthermore it’s a terrific investment in the business’ competitive advantage its people.

http://tomtunguz.com/mobile-only-saas/,The First Mobile-Only SaaS Company,The First Mobile-Only SaaS Company Mobile visits account for more than 50% of all e-commerce. During the holiday season in 2014 that figure exceeded 70% for Walmart. In India mobile usage dominates traffic to such an extent that Myntra the largest retailer is shutting down their web application to focus exclusively on their mobile apps. Instagram launched a website only after the mobile app reached more than 100M users. If the consumer world is any indication of the future we should expect to see a massively successful mobile-only SaaS company in the next few years. User preferences for simpler app UIs the advantages of mobile app distribution through app stores and the consumerization of IT (the notion that end users now make IT purchasing decisions rather than the CIO) are three key forces creating this opportunity for startups. In addition there’s a fourth wave: according to Intuit research 40% of Americans will be freelancers in five years fueled by companies like Uber PostMates HomeJoy and others. This simply compounds the opportunity for mobile software. Not every category of software has the potential to become mobile only. Many workers prefer to use laptops at work for bigger screens. For example a CFO’s accounting application or an engineer’s development environment are unlikely to transform exclusively into mobile apps. In addition many SaaS products have a 2 step value proposition selling first to an end user and then to an ultimate purchaser and decision-maker. However there are huge swaths of the working population that don’t work in desk jobs and who rely on their mobile phones and tablets as their primary computer. Field sales people hair-stylists plumbers and construction teams are some examples. Anyone who is trying to organize and run their business always on the go and who an individual business owner or operator of a small business is the perfect target market for the first mobile-only software company. The consumer world is rapidly migrating to mobile as the predominant computing platform and in some cases the exclusive platform. At some point in the very near future software products will move in the same direction. Published 2015-05-08,Published 2015-05-08
http://tomtunguz.com/content-marketing-optimization/,The Optimal Blog Post Length to Maximize Viewership,The Optimal Blog Post Length to Maximize Viewership Bhutan the world’s largest book at UWashington Library Anyone who has ever penned a blog post has asked how long should this post be to maximize viewership? I’ve often wondered the same thing particularly in the moment before I click the publish button and broadcast a perhaps-too-short-perhaps-too-long post into the Interwebs. I’ve written 256 posts in the past 18 months and I sought to understand the impact of word count on every metric I could measure: page views time on site time on page bounce rate exit rate retweets and favorite activity. Here’s the data. In short post length has no meaningful impact viewership engagement or sharing. Below is a chart depicting the correlation of word count to six key metrics. In each of these cases the correlations are small (<25%) and relatively speaking insignificant predictors of traffic. Metrics Bounce rate The fraction of visitors who came to the site to view a post and left without reading any others Exit rate The fraction of visitors who came to the site on another page and left on this post Time on page and site Self-explanatory Page views per visit The number of other blog posts read during a visit Retweet frequency and Twitter favorite activity The number of times a post is retweeted or favorited on Twitter which often means saved to read later. My posts vary from 100 to 1100 words with the majority between 300 and 750 and a median of 461 words. These posts aren’t exceptionally short or exceptionally long but I imagine they are comparable with most blogs that post near-daily. Below is the distribution of the 256 posts by word count. Plunging into the finer points of the analysis below is a box plot demonstrating the relationship between page views and word count. I’ve bucketed posts by keyword in 200 word increments. Note the Y-Axis is Log10. The boxes show the distributions of page views in each bucket. The middle line in each box is the median the borders of the rectangle show the 25th and 75th quartiles and the circles are outliers. More on reading box plots. There is no difference in the traffic generated by longer or shorter posts. Though the ranges of the box plots vary the medians are all very close to each other and while the 200 keyword bucket does seem to indicate a narrow distribution of page views the three outliers at the top indicate the conclusion is likely a product of the smaller sample size. In the end the data reaffirms what I probably already knew to start. The best length for a blog post is the length required to capture and convey the message. No more no less.

http://tomtunguz.com/mrr-growth/,How Fast Must a SaaS Startup Grow to Raise a Series A?,How Fast Must a SaaS Startup Grow to Raise a Series A? Last week Sean Ellis made an interesting comment in response to this post on public SaaS companies’ growth rates: I’m guilty of giving the same advice to startup founders without providing a transparent rationale. This post is my explanation of why the 15-20% MRR growth number is a reasonably good target for post-Seed/pre-Series A SaaS startups to aim for. Let’s create a hypothetical SaaS startup called SaaSCo with a set of founders who aspire to a fund-raising trajectory like the one in table below. The numbers in this chart are rough estimates of what a fast growing SaaS startup might command in the market but they aren’t based in any data or surveys. Round Raised in $M % Sold Implied Valuation in$M Seed 1 15% 6.7 Series A 5 20% 25 Series B 10 20% 50 Series C 15 15% 100 Presuming the founders of SaaSCo raise their target seed round the founders want to leverage their newfound cash to grow the business to reach the next milestone the Series A. To reach their target Series A valuation and holding all other variables constant the SaaSCo founders must grow their revenues by 3.75x which is 25 ⁄6.7. As my colleague Jamie Davidson showed in his analysis of startup follow-on activity the most successful time for startups to raise a Series A is about 9-10 months after raising a seed. Combining these two data points the SaaSCo founders deduce they must increase revenues by 3.75x in about 10 months. Backing out the monthly growth rates to achieve those numbers gives us the chart below. To satisfy both the revenue and timing conditions the SaaSCo founders should aim for a 15%+ monthly growth rate. There are quite a few problems with this analysis. Most importantly the fund-raising market isn’t completely rational or elastic so the presumption of a constant valuation-to-revenue multiple on SaaSCo is a fallible one. Also there are lots of deviations in startup paths that are hard to predict both positive and negative so planning on constant growth is difficult. Last we’re not taking into account the varying impacts of burn rate churn rate and hiring needs demanded on the company by pursuing different monthly growth rates. But this hypothetical models makes the case for 15%+ monthly revenue growth as a good rule of thumb for SaaS companies looking to raise a Series A soon. The same process can be used to create ballpark estimates for post-Series B and C companies as well. Published 2014-03-17,Published 2014-03-17
http://tomtunguz.com/table-stakes-saas/,The Rising Table Stakes in SaaS,The Rising Table Stakes in SaaS Christoph Janz one of the best seed stage SaaS investors published a great tweetstorm on the state of the SaaS ecosystem yesterday. I’ve copied it below. There’s no excuse for not understanding your metrics for not providing great customer service for not understanding the role of customer success for not doing intelligent lifecycle marketing for not doing great content marketing…What was hard and innovative 5 years ago is #tablestakes now. The mechanics of SaaS startups are becoming better and better understood as the community and sites like Jason Lemkin’s SaaStr and David Skok’s For Entrepreneurs and Christoph’s own blog curate the stories explain the complexity and reveal the metrics behind the fastest growing SaaS companies of our time. And as Christoph points out the marketing sales and customer retention benchmarks have been well analyzed by things like the PacCrest Survey among others. Reading through Christoph’s brief tweetstorm reaffirmed for me how managing complex SaaS startups can be. Founders must understand the unique financial characteristics of SaaS companies how to market them how to sell the product how to retain customers and all the benchmarks and metrics and execution complexity associated with them. And they must be able to hire the right people to manage those operations as the company grows. There’s lots of data out there but to be great one has to read it all internalize it and leverage it - no mean feat when operating a fast-moving high-growth company. As the tablestakes for SaaS companies evolves from the discovery of fundamental SaaS startup mechanics to how to erect differentiated and exceptional SaaS companies the challenges facing founders only increases because the sophistication of the entire ecosystem has increased one notch or two. Thankfully many founders have created businesses solving the SaaS complexity problems for other SaaS companies; Zuora for billing Gainsight for customer success Infer for sales prioritization Looker for Analytics. In so doing they eliminate complexity for a SaaS company enabling them to focus on higher leverage areas. And that may be the most important point of all. Today there is a vibrant bustling community of people passionate about SaaS passionate about the next generation models of acquiring and retaining customers and passionate about building the fundamental software companies of the future. If we succeed it will be because of this wonderful ecosystem of founders and operators salespeople and marketers striving every day to make something exceptional - and then telling everyone else how they did it. That’s the engine of Silicon Valley increasing the table stakes every day. Published 2015-01-14,Published 2015-01-14
http://tomtunguz.com/the-next-technology-wave-saas/,The Next Major Technology to Shape SaaS,The Next Major Technology to Shape SaaS Last week a friend asked me what I thought the future of software would be. At some point all the workflow processes that still conducted on paper and pencil will be digitized all of the tasks completed in Excel will be optimized and the majority of limitations of traditional software will be overcome. It’s not to say that software innovation in its current form will continue to exist for decades but what is the fundamental shift that resets the ecosystem like the cloud did in the early 2000s? For as long as they have been around computers have only understood a handful of languages. But they have never really comprehended spoken English. They have never seen a photograph and recognized it as El Capitan. Or gotten the drift of an email from one coworker to another. As one entrepreneur described to me the most powerful tool most computer users employ is Microsoft Word but the computer has no idea what the human is typing in that document. Contrast that with engineers who speak computer languages and can orchestrate thousands of machines working seamlessly together in order to crawl the Internet target an advertisement or prioritize the best lead for salesperson to call by writing code in a language the computer understands. I think it’s semantic understanding. We have seen the very first threads of this in products like Wolfram Alpha. You can type in a query that asks “Giants wins away games versus the Cowboys” and Wolfram Alpha will understand immediately that you are asking about the New York Giants (American football team) not the San Francisco Giants (baseball team). You’re asking about games that are played outside of New York and against another football team called the Dallas Cowboys. And you’re probably asking this about the teams in the modern era because before 1926 the Cowboys were based in Kansas City. You can try all kinds of odd queries like quote what is the mass of the moon multiplied by the height of a blue whale? There is an incredible amount technology behind this. The product of that technology is a magical experience. In this case the computer understands all the context and nuances associated with a question without it having to be provided. That is semantic understanding. Imagine mobile app that listens to your phone calls and automatically update the Salesforce record. Or a CRM that reads your emails reminds you about your customer’s wedding anniversary and prompts you to send a note. Or a calendar that automatically reschedules meetings depending on the changing priorities in your day and your physical location. In all these cases the computer uses contextual understanding to act. These products and many many more are not so far away. In fact we have bits and pieces of these experiences already in products like Google Now RelateIQ Infer. But that’s just the beginning. Published 2015-11-02,Published 2015-11-02
http://tomtunguz.com/fundamental-unit-of-saas-growth/,The Fundamental Unit of SaaS Growth,The Fundamental Unit of SaaS Growth After your SaaS startup has found product market fit the next evolution of the business is to discover the fundamental unit of SaaS growth. A fundamental unit is the atomic go-to-market team: the minimum number of people in the marketing sales and support roles to be able to support X customers and generate Y in revenue. At the point that a startup has discovered their fundamental unit time cash and execution become the limiting factors of the business. Most of the other risks in a company’s path have been mitigated. In other words it’s time to raise a growth round to scale the business. The key members of a fundamental unit are depicted above. These are the questions when determining the composition of a fundamental unit: How many marketing team members and how much marketing spend are required to create enough leads to feed a Sales Development Rep (SDR) who tees up meetings for an Account Executive (AE) to close? Once the AE has closed the customer how many Customer Success (CS) managers are required to keep customers happy and how many Upsell reps must be staffed to generate negative churn? Each startup’s fundamental unit will vary in its particular ratios. Below are the ranges I’ve seen for these ratios but keep in mind there’s lots of variability for different types of businesses (SMB vs Enterprise Word of Mouth vs Outbound customer acquisition etc): Marketing: quite variable; it depends on the main customer acquisition channels of the business. SDR to AE: varies from 1:1 to 1:3 depending on lead volume and lead qualification rates CSM per Customer: one industry rule of thumb is 1 CSM per every $1-2M of ACV. But this figure varies. Companies with smaller Average Revenue per Customer and less developed products will need to staff larger ratios of CSMs. Upsell Executives per AE: this figure varies by company revenue size from about 1:8 to 1:3 according to data from the 2014 PacCrest survey Once a company has figured out the math namely the ratios of people in each role and total spend the business must transition into hiring onboarding and managing as many fundamental units as quickly as possible. And at this point the company knows precisely the revenue contribution and cost of each team. In other words just add cash to grow. Published 2014-11-25,Published 2014-11-25
http://tomtunguz.com/price-discovery/,The Most Effective Price Discovery Question for Your Startup,The Most Effective Price Discovery Question for Your Startup Pricing is one of the most challenging decisions for any startup. One of the simplest ways of discovering customer willingness to pay is simply to ask them. At first blush that might seem a reasonable and effective solution it is prone to wild inaccuracy. Absolute pricing judgments are hard without reference points. For example: How much would you be willing to pay for a new iPhone? It’s a very challenging question to answer in the abstract. It all depends on what the phone can do and what sacrifices I would have to make to be able to afford that phone. That calculus isn’t any different for smart phones expense management software or flash storage. Every pricing conversation is a game of trade-offs. Instead of asking what a customer might pay for your product an absolute pricing question it’s more effective to ask a relative pricing question: Would you be willing to pay more for a new iPhone or a new Android HTC One? How much would you be willing to pay for a mobile CRM compared to a desktop CRM? If flash storage improves performance by 30% how much more would you be willing to pay than a standard hard disk? These comparative questions establish a point of reference for the customer and force them to make a relative value judgment by comparing a new product to an existing product where value and price are known. This is much more valuable data because the opinions will reflect more accurately the feedback you will receive in the market. No decision is ever made in the abstract - they are always trade-offs because every customer’s resources are finite. Purchasing decisions are no exception. The hypothetical “how much would you pay for X?” question will always generate bad data because the decision is made in the abstract. On the other hand comparative pricing questions establish relative value between existing products. You will quickly be able to tell which products are more important and valuable. And in talking to your potential customers you will better understand both the competitive solutions and the complementary solutions for your product. Most importantly of all you’ll understand the pricing decision process for your customers. You may very well find different segments of customers have radically different decision-making processes and your products features and pricing should reflect those differences. I use relative pricing questions in researching the market opportunities for startups and on the whole they shed much more inside the customers' viewpoint than absolute pricing questions. I hope you can use it in your pricing discovery processes and find it to be as effective as I have. Published 2013-06-11,Published 2013-06-11
http://tomtunguz.com/how-important-is-profitability-in-saas/,How Important Is It For a SaaS Startup to be Profitable?,How Important Is It For a SaaS Startup to be Profitable? The Information reported last week that in 2014 only 11% of tech IPOs in 2014 were profitable when they became publicly traded companies an all time low stretching back to 1980 when the figure was 88%. This raises the seemingly absurd question how important is it to be profitable for a startup? After all growth is the largest determinant of valuation at IPO not profitability. Only 19 of the 48 publicly traded SaaS companies in the basket I track have ever recorded a financial year with a positive net income. As the chart above shows the median publicly traded SaaS company marked in red never achieves positive net income. There are a handful of outliers who have sustained positive net income for a while but they are very few. Only 3 companies of the 48 have more positive net income years than negative net income years. However cash flow is a different story. All 48 companies have recorded a year with positive cash flow from operations and the median company reaches cash flow positive six years after founding and sustains the trend. Some like LinkedIn do this in spectacular fashion charting more than $569M in 2014 cash from operations. Which is a better metric of the health of a SaaS company though net income or cash flow from operations? For a quick primer on these metrics see this short post the differences between Bookings MRR Revenue and Cash. Cash flow from operations measures the changes in the company’s bank accounts. Accounts grow when customers pay to use software and accounts shrink as the company pays its employees rent and other expenses. Cash flow break even means the company’s coffers are growing. The data above implies most SaaS companies grow their cash reserves each year. This is possible because of the frequent SaaS practice of asking for up-front payments from customers. On the other hand positive net income means the company’s recognized revenue exceeds the costs of the business that year. It’s a much higher bar. Let’s paint the difference with an example. A SaaS company books a 3 year $3M deal. On the first day of the contract the company’s cash balance increases by $3M and the company can spend $2.9M for the rest of the year and still record a positive cash flow year. But the company can only recognize $1M each year in revenue per the terms of accrual accounting so to be net income positive the company can only spend $1M on its R&D Sales and Marketing real estate and all other costs. Most public SaaS companies prefer to invest their cash into faster growth at the expense of their net income. The argument of the day defending this tactic is that if the company wanted to achieve net income profitability the business would simply stop spending as much to grow and wait for the subscription payments to come in yielding great profitability. We can argue both sides. But at this point the market is rewarding SaaS businesses for growth irrespective of net income. Should there come a time when the public markets demand both cash flow break even and net income positive businesses then the consequence will be substantially smaller growth rates for many of these businesses because they will be far more constrained by the amount of capital they can invest in growth.

http://tomtunguz.com/cooley-valuation-data/,The Meteoric Acceleration in Series A Valuations,The Meteoric Acceleration in Series A Valuations What a difference a few quarters make! In the past nine months Series A valuations have skyrocketed. In fact 2014 Series A pre-money valuations have surpassed median Series B valuations from 10 years ago accounting for inflation. The same is true for Series B valuations exceeding Series C valuations. Cooley a top tier startup law firm reported this trend in their valuation quarterly report which tracks these figures where they are counsel to either investors or founders. The chart above illustrates Series A pre-money valuations in red. The grey line smooths the chart to show long term changes and the blue dashed line marks the 2004 Median Series B pre-money. In Q2 2014 the median Series A transaction reported by Cooley exceeded the 10 year Series B valuation. In fact Series A prices have simply taken off nearly doubling in six months. This is the same chart for Series B valuations. Pre-money valuations have increased in Series Bs as well although to a lesser degree than Series As. Series B valuations have also exceeded their ten year Series C prices but the rise has been more gradual than in Series As. The Series A valuation explosion is probably fueled by the tripling of capital in the institutional seed market. As young startups raise larger seed rounds they are able to progress further develop more momentum and increase their valuations before raising the next round of capital the Series A. As for the question why now? It may be that the first wave of big-seed-round-startups who raised in 2012 and 2013 are maturing 12 to 18 months later. This valuation increase hasn’t manifested itself in Crunchbase data yet. There are a few possible reasons for this. First Cooley’s data focuses on a tiny sliver of startups and this sample may have a very strong skew to the most valuable companies. Second Crunchbase reports the round size but not valuations. Perhaps investment size is remaining constant but valuations have increased and investors are satisfied with less ownership. Third Crunchbase data may be delayed because some of the Cooley transactions haven’t been announced yet. Nevertheless I’ll be paying attention to the Series A market because if the trend continues and the Series A replaces the B we can finally state with confidence that the Series Seed is new Series A which would imply a very substantial change in industry dynamics. Institutional seed funds will have become the new de-facto Series A investor. NB: If you’re a founder I recommend reading Cooley’s report which reveals the standard terms found in today’s term sheets. This data should help you understand what to negotiate for when raising capital. Published 2014-11-03,Published 2014-11-03
http://tomtunguz.com/the-twitter-game/,The Twitter Game Google’s Bin and Other Force Multipliers,The Twitter Game Google’s Bin and Other Force Multipliers When I started at Google I began working in the AdSense Online Sales and Operations team. The demand for AdSense was overwhelming and we received tens of thousands of website applications each day asking to be granted permission to run Google’s ad product on their websites. Sometimes automated approval systems would reject an application based upon strong spam or fraud signals. But thousands of applications each day demanded additional human judgement. So a team of us worked “the Bin.” The Bin was an approval tool that gathered all the data possible about an applicant from external sources and internal sources and presented the data in one hyper-data-dense screen which provided us all the information necessary to make a decision as quickly as possible. In my eyes it was the zenith of productivity software. The leverage was astounding: a team of five to ten people could routinely process about 10k requests each day. Applications were approved and dispatched in a few seconds with some keyboard shortcuts. Over the past few days I’ve been building a “Bin” of my own that ingests Twitter followers and LinkedIn contacts. I dubbed it the “Twitter Game.” The tool is downright ugly but it’s effective. The Twitter Game gathers data from the web about these users through various APIs presents each individual one at a time on the screen and I sift through them looking for interesting people to meet and startups I should know about. The salient accounts are placed into a follow up bucket with a few keyboard shortcuts (which are surprisingly easy to code with jQuery). Building this tool is part of my strategy of social media mechanization and trying to measure the value of blog by ensuring that I’m reaching the right audience with my content. Each startup has examples of tools like the Bin and the Twitter game that are built out of necessity. And though they never receive the credit they deserve such tools are force multipliers.

http://tomtunguz.com/bull-market/,When Will the Tech Bull Market End?,When Will the Tech Bull Market End? When will the tech bull market end? It’s a question that I’m asked with some frequency. There are three fundamental reasons for the bull market. First technology is changing nearly every part of the economy. Consequently there are many huge opportunities for entrepreneurs to seize. Our internal analysis shows that only 2% of IT budgets are spent on cloud today. Second the capital startups require to pursue those opportunities is plentiful. 2014 will be the third largest year in VC fundraising since 2000. Third the exit market is vibrant and rewards market leaders with massive outcomes. In other words there is a lot of strength in the fundamentals of the tech ecosystem. But aren’t startup valuations at crazy levels? Price is a function of supply and demand. Prices for startup shares have increased dramatically over the past few years as the dollars raised by VCs has doubled year over year while the amount of great companies founded each year has not. As long as there is more demand than supply and investors can generate “reasonable” returns prices will be sustained or will increase. Looking at 9 of the IPOs in 2014 investors in nearly every stage of every company will generate a positive return. What would cause a change in the environment? The biggest risk is the public market changes the way it values companies. The financing markets are a train and the IPO market and M&A markets are the locomotive setting pricing multiples and valuations. If the public markets decide a tech startup is worth materially less than private market investors thought then lots of investment is underwater and prices correct. For example in January 2014 the public markets priced SaaS companies at 8x forward revenue. Three months later that figure fell to about 5x. The outlook of those 40 publicly traded SaaS companies had’t improved or worsened during that time but this basket of companies was worth 33% less than a quarter before because large investors rotated from growth stocks to value stocks. If these exit markets slow down so will every other car in the train (Series A B etc) because sustained multiples reduction of that scale impacts the return profile for every investor from seed through growth. Alternatively current publicly traded companies could consistently miss their revenue and earnings targets indicating weakness in the economy or limited market size. This weakness would cascade into the private markets and push valuation lower. But that isn’t happening. In Q3 70% of the publicly traded VC-backed tech companies I surveyed exceeded expectations meanining these companies have a good degree of predictibility of their businesses. At some point the tech bull market will change. But at the moment founders are building impressively large disruptive companies. VCs flush with cash are financing startups at the fastest pace in 14 years. When these startups reach scale the IPO and M&A markets welcome these businesses. Public market investors seek returns unattainable elsewhere and acquirers buy the growth necessary to stay on top of their industries. It’s a great time to be a founder.

http://tomtunguz.com/startup-names/,Using Data to Pick the Optimal Name for Your Startup,Using Data to Pick the Optimal Name for Your Startup Naming your startup can be one of the hardest things to do when starting a company. Each founder must agree. The domain must be available to buy. Last and perhaps most importantly investors need to like it because the first letter of startup’s name has meaningful impact on how easily the company will be able to raise money. Whatever you do don’t pick a name that starts with the letter J. Or K. Or Q. Instead favor names beginning with T O and A. Below is a chart showing the share of capital raised by startups broken down by the first letter of their names for Series A rounds of IT companies in 2013. The data is normalized for the number of startups with each letter-name. Startups with T-names raise 100% more capital during the Series A than the average startup. Startups with the letter A garner 50% larger investments. On the other hand founders who mistakenly chose J-words raised 50% less capital in 2013 quite a disadvantage in the market. The data clearly proves picking the right letter for a startup’s name is correlated to the amount of money the company will raise in its Series A. But here’s the trick: the relationship isn’t causal just correlated. So all that advice about picking the right letter…it’s useless. What’s in a name after all? Looker by any other name would still analyze data elegantly. Thanks to @milesgrimshaw who inspired this reminder not to believe everything you read even if there’s seemingly cohoret data to support the argument. Published 2014-02-07,Published 2014-02-07
http://tomtunguz.com/sharing-patterns/,The Secrets Behind Content Sharing Widgets,The Secrets Behind Content Sharing Widgets At the bottom of this blog there’s an inocuous sharing bar with links to share this post on Twitter Facebook LinkedIn HackerNews and subscribe by email and RSS. 1.5% of visitors click on one of these buttons. Despite the similarity of the buttons and the clicks the value they generate as sharing tools varies dramatically. The chart above shows data from the widget on this blog for the past 30 days comparing the number of clicks on each button and the traffic that results from that channel. Three traffic generation behaviors emerge from this chart which I call the charts (HackerNews) the networks (Twitter Facebook LinkedIn) and the 1-to-1s (Email RSS). Not many people submit posts to HackerNews but those clicks generate 3x their share of traffic. Social networks generate roughly the same share of clicks and traffic. 1-to-1 marketing channels particularly email generate more than their share of clicks but very little traffic by comparison. In other words it’s a natural funnel. Given these patterns I’ve developed a mental model for maximizing the value of each channel which is shown below. The goal of this model is to capture as much traffic from the charts and convert those readers into long-term relationships as efficiently as possible. On the left is a chart with reach the number of users a content marketing channel commands on the y-axis and on the x-axis the frequency I can engage with those readers. On the right side of the chart I’ve listed the goals of each content marketing channel. Let’s walk through it in more detail. Charts: Charts concentrate distribution. Like the Billboard 100 or iTunes Top 25 top grossing content marketing “charts” collect millions of users each day and generate huge/interest traffic spikes in the feature stories and products. Charts are editorially curated either by a small group in the case of publications (TechCrunch GigaOm WSJ NYTimes) or a very large group (HackerNews Reddit). Individuals with great influence over social networks and who perform a content curation function people like Hiten Shah or Joel Gascoigne are also “charts.” It’s hard to break into the charts because everyone with a story wants to be on that list and for good reason. Charts are powerful reader acquisition tools because they provide access to a huge breadth of readers. To maximize the value of the charts the traffic they generate must be bottled in some way. Social networks provide that bottling mechanism. Social networks amplify content within smaller networks. Likes RTs and +1s confer social proof which is one of the most powerful influences on people. That social proof drives new potential readers to become followers of this blog on a social network. 1 to 1 provide a persistent content marketing relationship and immediate addressablity. I can email readers and they can email me. The ultimate goal of every content marketing campaign is to send the right message to the right people at the right time. To do that I believe in first reaching lots of people then using the social proof instrinsic to social networks to influence and encourage readers to build a long term relationship. Those grandiose goals all start with a simple little sharing widget. Notes about the Analysis The event data is gathered using Google Analytics custom tracking feature.

http://tomtunguz.com/private-market-public-market-disparity/,The Runaway Train of Late Stage Fundraising,The Runaway Train of Late Stage Fundraising Every morning it seems like a startup raises a massive growth round. In fact the data proves the point. In 2014 there were 251 working days and 211 $40M+ growth rounds - just about one per day. In contrast to the frenetic private market there were 15 US IT venture-backed IPOs with offerings greater than $40M last year slightly more one IPO per month in 2014. Private market rounds were 14x as common as IPOs in 2014 compared to the 2004-2007 era when IPOs were about as equally common as large private financings. As Bill Gurley wrote “These large high-priced private financings are the defining characteristic of this particular technology cycle.” In the past companies went public to raise large amounts of capital because the IPO markets were the only place to do it. Going public meant a lot of internal work preparing for regulatory scrutiny but a substantial cash injection and shareholder liquidity. Today that’s no longer the case. The private markets have supplied $7B in equity in the past two years and the public markets provided $37B a greater than 5X multiple. Before Lehman’s implosion it was the other way around. Startups raised 3-6x as much capital in the public markets. Large private market financings are very attractive for startups. As the chart above shows the average amount raised in a large growth financing of about $110M is roughly equal to the amount company could raise at IPO (setting aside the Facebook outlier in 2012). Why bother with the hassle of auditors and roadshows when a company has to convince 40 or so public market investors to fill out a round when one or two private investors will take the whole round after a few meetings? If high priced financings are the defining characteristic of this part of the technology cycle one has to wonder what this private market exuberance implies for the next cycle. Glass half-full: we’re going to see a huge swath of IT IPOs in the next few years. Glass half-empty: many of the companies that have raised massive growth rounds won’t be financially fit enough to be able to go public and investor/employee/shareholder liquidity will be a major challenge. The reality will bear out somewhere in between and the limiting factor will be public market investor appetite for these tech companies. Of course acquisitions will also become more common (2014 proved that trend). It’s a very heady time for startups and investors. There’s a marked separation between the investment preferences of public and private investors. And while the initial data from the 2014 IPOs show private market investors still generate returns even when investing immediately before IPO in many cases late stage private rounds are priced so aggressively that IPOs are down rounds. I’m not going to pretend to know how the future unfolds or how the markets will evolve. The data shows though that the current investment levels aren’t yet justified by the exit environment. 231 companies raised $40M+ growth rounds in 2014. For comparison roughly 240 VC backed IT companies have gone public in the last ten years. Said another way we would need to 2x the number of IPOs in 2000 for all of these growth stage companies to become public. Who knows where this runaway train of financing will lead. It could be to one of the greatest exit environments in tech history or something much less rosy. Published 2015-04-01,Published 2015-04-01
http://tomtunguz.com/saas-valuation-bubble/,The SaaS Valuation Bubble,The SaaS Valuation Bubble In the past 24 months something extraordinary has happened. The value of publicly traded SaaS companies has grown by 200 to 400% while the underlying customer unit economics of those businesses hasn’t changed. Below is a chart of the ratio between enterprise value to revenue for two segments of SaaS companies. The All Segment contains 36 publicly traded SaaS companies. The High Fliers comprises the upper half. From about 2004 to 2011 the average publicly traded SaaS company held an EV/Rev multiple of 3 to 5x. Since 2011 that figure has been multiplied by 4 to 7 times. Today those ratios stand at 12 to 20x. This dramatic acceleration has increased startup valuations in parallel. Twelve months ago I saw most SaaS startups raising in the 5 to 10x this year’s revenue range. In the past few months valuations have soared to nearly double those multiples higher for some exceptional startups. Investors who have witnessed the public comparables double in value are increasingly willing to move further out on the risk/reward curve. How can this be? We know cost efficiencies are’t the driver behind these trends. SaaS companies haven’t been able to dramatically reduce their sales and marketing expense. Revenue growth is the main driver. In the 2004 to 2009 period average revenue growth for SaaS companies hovered around 25%. In 2010 SaaS companies as a whole began investing more to grow faster and in the past three years average growth rates have risen to about 35%. But this came at the expense of reducing net income to revenue by about half. In other words these business take 50% of their profits and reinvest in growth. Ostensibly the revenue growth figure is skewed by the surge in young SaaS IPOs which should grow faster than their older more established brothers. But that’s not quite true. This bar chart shows the distribution of the top 50% of SaaS companies by EV/Rev multiple. The distribution is quite even. Older and younger companies are fetching these huge multiples indicating the valuation increase trend is broad. There’s no question that SaaS has brought a revolution to users and administrators in terms of software ease of use accessibility and management. Today that value is handsomely and disproportionately rewarded in the public markets. But these trends have a way of reverting to the mean over time. Published 2013-10-22,Published 2013-10-22
http://tomtunguz.com/obscure-economic-concept-behind-saas-pricing-challenges/,The Obscure Economic Idea Behind SaaS Pricing Challenges,The Obscure Economic Idea Behind SaaS Pricing Challenges Startups struggle to set the right price for their products because pricing dynamics in the field don’t obey the laws taught in the classroom. The standard supply and demand curves drawn above imply that as price increases demand decreases; that buyers act rationally and that this law is immutable. But this simply isn’t the case. Buyers in the market place violate the traditional supply and demand model all the time. For example Veblen goods defy the traditional pricing theory. First described by Thorstein Veblen an American economist in the early 1900s who taught at Stanford demand for Veblen goods increases as prices rise. Veblen observed this behavior in the leisure class of his era. Since then luxury cars art wine have been classified as Veblen goods. Above I’ve drawn the demand curve for Veblen goods. In a complete reversal from the first chart the red demand line in the Veblen Good case ascends as price grows. The Veblen demand curve isn’t limited to the purchasing patterns of luxury goods. It also manifests itself in SaaS sales processes. Bill Macaitis the former CMO of Zendesk described Veblen goods behavior when he and the Zendesk product marketing team began to address enterprise customers to complement their booming SMB (small-and-medium business) business. The product marketing team initially charged a modest premium for the enterprise product. But the experiment failed. Demand was immaterial. As they experimented with other price points the team discovered demand surged as the price ballooned. Today the Zendesk enterprise plans cost 10x as much as standard plans. Enterprise buyers like Veblen’s luxury class exhibit different buying preferences from other segments. Because their willingness to pay is substantially higher than smaller businesses these buyers often equate price with quality. At a very small price point they ask a natural question: Since the product is so inexpensive is it a a toy or true enterprise solution? In Zendesk’s market standard supply and demand theory describes behavior in the small to medium business segment and the Veblen goods concept captures the patterns of enterprises. Zendesk’s example illustrates exactly why pricing can be so challenging for SaaS companies. There are two types of demand curves in the marketplace: a standard curve and a Veblen curve. Markets with multiple demand curves aren’t unique to Zendesk. They plague many consumerization of IT startups. These companies initially target end-users with free or inexpensive price points and eventually use that distribution to win larger contracts. I’ve tried to illustrate this behavior in the demand curve above. The nuances and particularities of each market and each startups go-to-market strategies determine the shape of the demand curve within a segment. Today there is no single model to describe the schizophrenic nature of different buyer segments. But understanding some of the lesser-known economic theories that describe eccentric supply and demand behavior like Veblen goods may help inform and accelerate product marketing’s pricing experiments.

http://tomtunguz.com/tech-earnings-scorecard-q214/,What Q2 Tech Earnings Reports Say About the State of the Technology Market,What Q2 Tech Earnings Reports Say About the State of the Technology Market I’ve never paid much attention to earnings reports in the past. But as I’ve been analyzing the tech industry more and more and the stock market has begun to surpass record highs I’ve been wondering whether the persistent bull market in tech is healthy. Or at the very least whether the companies pushing the industry forward are able to understand the environment and their businesses well enough to meet the commitments they make to public market investors. To get a better sense of this I’ve charted the Revenue and EPS (earnings-per-share) figures for two baskets of public technology companies a consumer and an enterprise basket. Through the end of last week about 25% of the public tech companies in these baskets had reported earnings for Q2 2014. I intend to update these charts each week or so as more companies report to refine the analysis. The chart above shows Revenue Surprise which is the difference between the revenue reported by the company and the expectations of analysts. Analysts expectations are guided by the company during previous earnings announcements. The theory goes that a well-managed publicly traded company should be able to hit its revenue plan. A company that guides investors to a certain revenue and earnings target and meaningfully misses its target should be concerning. So a positive or zero surprise is a good thing. If many tech companies begin to miss targets it might be a sign of tougher times ahead. So far in Q2 ‘14 fourteen of the twenty companies exceeded revenue expectations. Yahoo has been the worst miss to date with a 4% miss but on the whole the companies who have reported to date seem to be hitting their plans. Looking at Earnings-Per-Share (EPS) half of the companies exceeded their guidance. Amazon is the notable case missing its target by more than 100% because of greater costs in their core business and significant investments in new businesses like the Fire phone. Aside from Amazon’s outlier the rest of the field seems to be evenly divided with similar variances. It seems the majority of EPS misses to date are are consumer companies: Amazon Angie’s List Google GrubHub Pandora and Yahoo. Looking at the data by industry the initial data shows that on the whole enterprise companies have been outperforming their earnings targets by 25% (median) compared to 0% for consumer. This could be an indication of unanticipated strength in the enterprise market or greater predictability of those businesses but it’s worth more research to determine if that’s truly the case. So far the public technology companies that have reported earnings seem to be able to achieve their targets with a handful of negative earnings outliers. I’m curious to see how the rest of the earnings season unfolds. Published 2014-07-28,Published 2014-07-28
http://tomtunguz.com/salesforces-marketing-secret/,Salesforce's Marketing Secret: The Fourth Marketing P,Salesforce's Marketing Secret: The Fourth Marketing P In his book Behind the Cloud: The Untold Story of How Salesforce went from Idea to Billion Dollar Company and Revolutionized an Industry Marc Benioff shares the 111 plays he learned through Salesforce triumphant rise to the most valuable SaaS company in the world. Play 15 is my favorite from the book. Benioff writes “position yourself either as the leader or against the leader in your industry.” Play 15 highilghts the most frequently forgotten of marketing’s four Ps positioning. Positioning is easily forgotten because it’s the least tangible of the four. Price immediatly impacts revenue. Product well everyone has a point of view on product. Placement in today’s ecosystem means ad placements most often. In performance marketing the numbers speak for themselves. Positioning can be amorphous. Without a concentrated focus on unique positioning a company’s persona in the market muddles with competition in a customer’s mind. In Benioff’s words positioning means: Every experience you give a journalist or potential customer must explain why you are different and incorporate a clear call to action. This does not require a large team or big budget; it just requires your time and focus. Mastering positioning creates huge advantages for a company. Play 38 sums it up well. “Make Every Customer a Member of Your Sales Team.” In other words equip your champions to make a sale on your behalf. If the purpose of enterprise sales is helping customers get through their own internal buying processes strong and clear positioning empowers internal evangelists to help close deals. Getting back to Play 15 there’s a simple brilliance to Benioff’s advice of positioning a company either as the leader or the rival of the industry. The company instantly becomes part of every conversation every blog post every sales process. This is precisely what happened as Salesforce lobbed a stone at the Siebel’s foot. With an unwavering resolve and a simple but powerful NO SOFTWARE positioning Salesforce overtook the leader in the CRM market Siebel Systems in less than a decade. In particular Salesforce employed guerrilla marketing tactics at Siebel events. In San Francisco Salesforce hired mock protesters to proclaim the end of software drawing crowds and police and making Salesforce a major topic at the Siebel conference. In Cannes Benioff’s team rented out quite literally all the taxis and converted them into mobile Salesforce marketing booths ferrying Siebel conference attendees from the airport to the venue. In San Diego Salesforce replicated this play with bike rickshaws. Because of the simple powerful and clear positioning against the market leader and a relentless insistence to be part of every Siebel event Salesforce injected themselves into every buying conversation. Positioning is one of those intangible marketing concepts. But the intangilibility shouldn’t get in the way of understanding its potency to dramatically alter the the trajectory of a business. When combined with the three other ps Positioning can pack quite a punch. Published 2014-06-02,Published 2014-06-02
http://tomtunguz.com/data-is-useless-unless-you-can-act-on-it/,Data is Useless Unless You Can Act on It,Data is Useless Unless You Can Act on It I see a recurring three step pattern with data waves: First data collected. Then it’s presented. Last it is made actionable. In every data wave the companies that transform data into actionable insights are the most valuable because their products not only identify but solve problems. Knowing about an issue without understanding the mechanics required to fix it causes paralysis. Quantified self tools like FitBit and JawboneUp and Nike Fuel capture and display sleep data and while these devices confirm that I wake at 130am every night they can’t help me sleep through the night. This user experience induces neurosis. The same is true for the pedometer function - I can measure the steps I walk but not how much healthier I become (how much longer I’ll live). Similarly social media monitoring tools apprise marketers of the thousands of conversations across the web that are relevant to their brands but do little to recommend who to engage with what to write about and how to prevent large scale negative viral loops from spiraling out of hand. On the other hand true data based intelligence provides huge value to customers. For decades software logging faced a similar challenge. Engineers would log data into increasingly larger databases which rapidly became a cost-prohibitive practice. When Splunk developed tools to mine this data they unlocked the insights within the data which enabled engineers to act improving product performance. The measure of data is how much intelligence a user can derive from it and how quickly the user can respond to reinforce or counteract a new trend. Published 2013-01-24,Published 2013-01-24
http://tomtunguz.com/customer-success-why-now/,Why Customer Success? Why Now?,Why Customer Success? Why Now? When I started in the venture business and met software companies I never heard the words customer success during pitches or throughout diligence or in board meetings. A few years later customer success has become equal in importance to sales and marketing and engineering and product within SaaS companies. The steady increasing drumbeat of the Customer Success mantra is reflected in Google search traffic whose volumes have tripled since 2009 . So why now? I’ve been fortunate to meet two experts from McKinsey’s SaaS practice: Monica Adractas who is now head of customer retention at Box and Brian Stafford a partner. They explained to me customer success is a decades-old discipline. For example banks and telecom companies have mastered the practice of customer success over the past 20 or 30 years. Both of these industries are characterized by commodity goods slow growth in the absolute size of the market and intense competition. Stealing share from competitors is the only way to grow. Not surprisingly best-in-class customer success becomes a key differentiator. But the SaaS world isn’t marked by any of the characteristics of the banking and telecom sectors. SaaS spending is $18B and growing at about 20% per year . While competition exists in certain segments SaaS penetration is just a few percentage points of the total software market according to our internal analysis. As Brian and Monica explained to me SaaS startups are discovering the importance of customer success because of two important properties intrinsic to SaaS companies: the sales process and the delivery model. In traditional enterprise sales the salesperson sold the customer a product once for a perpetual license and committed the customer to pay an annual service fee often 15-25% of the price of the software. Companies like Tableau and QlikTech among others pursue a similar model in which customers pay for their own customer success. In contrast SaaS businesses face renewal sales processes constantly. Each time a customer sees the monthly or quarterly or annual subscription payment they wonder should I be paying for this? Renewal conversations occur with much greater frequency than with perpetual software sales. Startups that manage customer renewals better than their peers grow faster and require less capital. Additionally the buyer is now much closer to the end user. Unlike the enterprise sale to the head of IT where software is pushed down from the top SaaS companies take advantage of the consumerization of IT. Positive and negative feedback about the product flow much more freely and quickly to the buyer accelerating both purchasing and churn decisions. Consequently maintaining customers requires a nimble customer success team. Last the as-a-Service delivery model empowers a SaaS company to initially develop a Minimum Viable Product and iterate and improve the product over time. To ensure customers maximize the value from a constantly evolving product a startup must provide on-going training and persistent education in order to achieve engagement and true product/market fit. Often these conversations provide the customer success team with valuable product feedback to share with the product team. SaaS is transforming enterprise software. SaaS products evolve faster are cheaper to operate and are closer to the end user than enterprise software has ever been. But to achieve their true potential SaaS startups must master Customer Success and help customers understand how to master these new tools. Advances in the sales/renewal process and the product delivery demand it. Read more about customer success here Published 2014-08-12,Published 2014-08-12
http://tomtunguz.com/managing-energy/,Startup Best Practices 8 -Getting the Most from Your Team By Preventing Burnout,Startup Best Practices 8 -Getting the Most from Your Team By Preventing Burnout Startups are intense experiences. Driven by a burning passion to change some aspect of the world startup teams push push push to grow as fast as possible. Without the right balance though teams burn out - a terrible outcome. One of the most important responsibilities of every startup’s management team is to shepherd their teams to maximize their performance and prevent burnout. But how? Tony Schwartz founded The Energy Project a consultancy that focuses on educating managers on how to manage their team’s energy to maximize long-term team performance and well-being. The company works with Google eBay and lots of other Fortune 500s. Schwartz wrote a book on the topic called The Power of Full Engagement. I haven’t read the book but I’m a believer in one of the frameworks within it the 2x2 matrix above. Energy is marked on the y-axis and emotional state on the x-axis. Burnout the worst-case scenario occurs when people have negative emotions and low-energy. Many of us know this feeling well. The best place to be on the 2x2 is performance when we have lots of energy and positive emotions about our work. Survival occurs when we are producing lots of work but express negative emotions. And renewal is positive emotions but low energy. I’ve tended to cycle between survival and performance. I suspect many people in Startupland do too. But this isn’t the optimal quadrant-pair. Instead and it might seem counter-intuitive at first the better cycle is between renewal and performance. The renewal/performance cycle very sharply reduces the possibility of burnout by reinforcing positive emotions. To make use of this energy framework a manager should routinely even weekly take stock of which quadrant the team is in. How is the team’s energy? How upbeat is the team? These sentiments can surface in many places but often arise in one-on-ones. To shift teams from the left-side of the matrix to the right side requires rebuilding positive energy. The Energy Projects divides energy into four types: Physical: Is the team getting enough exercise and sleep? Are they eating well? Do they take regular breaks to recharge during the day? Emotional: Does the team find the time to work on projects they enjoy? Do teammates regularly share appreciation for work well done? Mental: Does the company provide the team an environment in which they can focus on their work? In which they can switch between reactive work and proactive thinking and long-term planning? Does the company respect work-life integration if not balance? Spiritual: Does the team feel committed to the vision of the business? Do they feel unified within their team? Does the company inspire them with a strong sense of purpose and act in ways consistent with their values? By breaking down the team’s current state into these four buckets managers can identify and address potential transitions burnout or to survival mode keeping the team happier and more productive for the long term. I like this framework because it provides tactical advice to managers on how to identify where their team may be. In addition the responses fall pretty neatly out of the questions. Too little sleep? Time to reallocate work across the team or prioritize better. Not enough focus? Reduce meeting volume or concentrate meetings into chunks. Lack of commitment to the vision? Let’s spend some time with the CEO and some customers. Published 2014-09-17,Published 2014-09-17
http://tomtunguz.com/building-42/,The Library in Building 42,The Library in Building 42 In the center of Google’s campus lie a cluster of four buildings: 40 41 42 and 43. Contained within building 42 was the epicenter of product management: Jonathan Rosenberg’s office. Immediately next to his office stood a collection of three bookcases containing a library of different books on various topics that JR curated. I used to pass that library every day on my way to meetings and each time I walked past I would pause to see which new volumes had arrived. Edward Tufte might have spoken at a Google Tech talk and left behind 15 copies of his work. Or a new shipment of linear regression textbooks may just have arrived. Or some new studies on machine learning might have popped up. Of all the perks at Google the access to continuing education is perhaps the one that receives the least press and most undeservedly so. Tech talks negotiations seminars sales training all the education you needed was there. It is a great feeling when someone takes interest in your education. Sometimes that interest can be a grand gesture but more often than not it is a combination of small ones like a new book in a product management library or a ticket to a deeply relevant conference. I firmly believe that every startup should have a continuing education program formal or informal. As founders and investors the best investments we can make are the ones in our teams. Those investments provide compounding benefits to the company. First they engender tremendous feelings of goodwill. Second the education improves our performance and helps us better achieve our potential. Third they serve as fantastic recruiting differentiators. A sticker graced the spine of each of those books: Property of the Google Product Management Library. I must sheepishly admit about a third of the books on my bookshelf at home today have that sticker. Those books have been permanently borrowed and put to good use: dog-eared and weathered and battered. And each time I look at them I remember that bookcase outside of JR’s office.

http://tomtunguz.com/using-metrics-to-build-communities/,Using metrics to build communities,Using metrics to build communities There is a Branch called Do platforms need to give users a number to optimize? Most platforms do provide a number to optimize: Twitter followers Facebook friends and so on. These metrics build liquidity in the platform as @satyap @ev and @hunterwalk point out. But there isn’t just one type of social metric. There are three. It’s important to distinguish the types of metrics a community can provide for users to optimize because the community will rally around the metrics the community provides. The long term dynamics may not be the expected or desired behavior. In my view there are three types of social metrics: User metrics Social validation metrics (Twitter followers Facebook friends/followers LinkedIn connections Klout score) - are proxies for trust or respect within a community. They are useful as trust signals and for initial social graph growth. Content metrics Engagement metrics (YouTube views app downloads Quora views) - demonstrate the popularity of an item and activity of the community broadly. Seeing a post with 212 likes immediately provides a sense of a large user base. These metrics are the least valuable measure because they can be manipulated easily. Behavior Metrics Karma metrics (retweets likes up votes Hacker News Karma content flags spam indicators) - Karma metrics measure positive and negative contributions to the community by combining user centric metrics like influence with content quality metrics. Pinterest and Tumblr have gradations of behavior (like vs repin/reblog). Karma metrics enforce a social filter on content because when users retweet or like they are expending their social capital to promote or endorse some content. When to use each metric At the outset of a community the primary goal is to build a trusted network of contributors who extol and enforce the values of a community. Therefore user metrics seem to be the most important. As communities evolve some sites pursue content metrics but I think the most vibrant communities ultimately pursue and champion behavior metrics because they can be actively managed to encourage the desired user behavior. The best behavior metrics have some vagueness some room to evolve in order to respond to changes in community behavior. For example Facebook is trying to mitigate the fake like problem Communities are living entities like cities that need to be cultivated nurtured and maintained. Metric selection is an essential component of this evolution. Published 2012-09-07,Published 2012-09-07
http://tomtunguz.com/open-source-software-environment/,The Disruptive Effect of Open Source Startups,The Disruptive Effect of Open Source Startups Open Source Software started the movement in the late 1990s. Since then open source software has transformed the software industry. Today many infrastructure software startups employ open source strategies to market their software and win dominant market share. Open source is a disruptive distribution strategy. It allows potential users and buyers of a software to try it evaluate it and understand exactly how it works because the source code is freely available. Open source companies market to developers exactly how developers would like to be marketed to - with code. Once many people are using an open source software startups generate revenue in a variety of different ways either charging for services and support of the open source software or developing closed source or premium features that enterprises are willing to pay for.One of the most interesting newer models is open source SaaS. As a result of both the disruptive nature of open source distribution and the changes in buyer preferences the number of open source financings has increased nearly monotonically since the genesis of the movement and it shows no signs of slowing. In 2014 venture capitalists invested in 37 separate open-source financings. Some open source companies have raised huge sums of money well over $100 million. The chart above shows the top 10 open source companies in terms of dollars raised. Three of the top 10 companies are filesystem companies commercializing Hadoop (Cloudera Hortonworks MapR). Two of the companies are database companies (MongoDB and Datastax). Mulesoft is a data movement company. Kaltura provides video rendering software. So it’s plain to see that open source software companies are playing in many software and infrastructure categories. VC interest in new open-source software is motivated by substantial exits. The chart above shows the top 10 open source acquisitions. SourceFire Novell and MySQL have all been worth $900 million or more in three separate categories of software: security operating systems and databases. Company Market Cap $B Revenue $M Gross Margin % RedHat 14.5 1790 85 HortonWorks 1.1 46 -75 In addition there are two publicly traded open-source companies RedHat and Hortonworks both which are worth more than $1 billion. RedHat is worth 14.4 billion making it more valuable than Splunk and ServiceNow and just about the same as WorkDay. However these companies couldn’t be more different in terms of gross margin profile. While Red Hat operates at 85% gross margin which is better than most SaaS companies Hortonworks recorded a negative gross margin last year because of the significant amount of revenue derived from professional services which are sold at a loss to the company to win market share. While many companies do distribute software via open source these businesses can employ radically different business models and consequently have contrasting financial profiles. I’m certain we’ll see quite a few more open-source software companies. While the movement has been around for more than 15 years the opportunity before these kinds of businesses has never been larger. There more developers than there have ever been. Companies of all kinds are starting to use software as competitive strategic advantage and the pace of innovation in infrastructure and software continues to increase.

http://tomtunguz.com/mobile-frequency-of-use/,How Mobile is Disrupting Even the Most Successful Internet Products,How Mobile is Disrupting Even the Most Successful Internet Products In 2008 iGoogle represented 20% of traffic to Google. Seven years later the mobile phone is the home screen of choice for a billion people. iGoogle is dead. Mobile killed it. The typical mobile phone user checks their phone 110 times per day. I suspect iGoogle’s most avid users visited about 10 times daily. By that math mobile home screens generate an order of magnitude more engagement. If Google or any company wants to provide the home screen to those billion people that home screen must be a mobile app. Mobile’s frequency of use is the reason for its disruptive nature. iGoogle’s successor will be the product that leverages the frequency afforded by mobile devices and provides access to all the critical information surfaced by apps through Android notifications to win share of habit. Whenever I check my phone during the day I step through the essential apps: SMS & messaging email calendar social (Twitter Instagram Facebook Tumblr etc) news blog stats stocks commute time package shipping data and so on. I imagine many people have a similar routine. Google Now provides half of this; Android notifications provides the other half. More than just providing iGoogle’s list of links or text snippets Android’s rich notifications and Google’s newly announced app-deep linking should enable users to act upon information sending emails opening news articles in Flipboard and responding to @messages in app. Google Now’s intelligent prioritization would show me the most important things first based upon my previous search actions email history and stock searches. Last the app would be available as the mobile home screen and also as a lockscreen widget. By combining notifications with the intelligence behind Google Now this new product would unify all the important data I want on one screen. This idealized product would become my mobile home screen and I suspect a homescreen for hundreds of millions of users. Whether or not Google or another company builds this successor to iGoogle doesn’t matter. The broader trend is the important one. The products that once dominated the web no longer fit the mobile users’ needs and present a huge opportunity for new products and companies to seize. Published 2013-11-04,Published 2013-11-04
http://tomtunguz.com/maximum-cash-burn/,How Much Cash Should Your SaaS Startup Burn?,How Much Cash Should Your SaaS Startup Burn? As the temperament of the fundraising market shifts particularly in the later stages the question of how much a startup should burn will become increasingly important. We’re living in a historic period of very inexpensive venture capital. These cheap dollars have fueled spectacular companies with record-setting growth rates. In such an environment growth at almost any cost is handsomely rewarded. But we’re observing the ecosystem starting a correction - particularly in the late stage of the market. And so burn rates will matter more and efficient growth will be prized again. What does that mean for founders when planning their 2016 budgets? After all everyone building a company wants the business to grow as quickly as possible. But that doesn’t mean spending all the cash reserves in the next sixth months. Here’s a top-down way of thinking about the maximum amount of burn a startup should sustain. It’s a useful exercise when paired with a bottoms-up financial plan starting with leads sales reps bookings and cash collections. When determining how much cash your startup can reasonably burn it’s important to plan for a multiple correction. Today the early and growth stage SaaS market prices companies on a forward revenue multiple. This is a public market investment term meaning the value of the company is equal to some number multiplied by the sum of the next twelve months of revenue. The top quartile public SaaS companies trade at about 7.5x forward revenues. The top 3 - Xero ServiceNow Workday trade at about 10.5x forward. The best companies in the private markets fetch roughly 15x forward or twice the public top quartile. Multiple is a function of many things including growth rate market attractiveness team qualification margins and other considerations. The chart above shows a hypothetical SaaS startup’s valuation evolution from Seed to Series A to Series B. Let’s suppose the company projected $2M in forward revenue at the A and $5M at the Series B. There are two valuation cases: The first case in blue shows the company raising at 15x forward revenues at Series A and Series B. The case in green shows the impact to valuation if a halving of the forward multiple to 8x were to occur in between the Series A and Series B. In the blue case the valuation of the business balloons from $30M to $75M. The company likely raises about $15-20M in the Series B and everything is roses. In the green case the valuation of the business increases modestly from $30M to $40M. The company likely raises $10M which means that the value of the business net of the new cash hasn’t change despite a 250% growth in revenue. This is certainly not the outcome the founders might have expected. The goal of this exercise is to determine exactly how far into the future the business must be in order to raise money at an increased valuation relative to the last round if multiples halve - and whether or not the company currently has enough cash to finance its operations through to that period plus enough time for fundraising. If the cash position of the company isn’t strong enough it’s time to cut burn and/or raise more money. Now let me say a few things about this framework. First I can’t say when or if this multiple correction will ever happen. Second I can’t promise that if multiples were to fall they would be at 8x forward - they might be higher or lower. Third forward multiples are much more common in the Series B and later rounds and less common in Series A and Seed so earlier stage companies may not have been priced this way in the past but they will be as they progress. Now let’s transition from the theory to the observed data. The chart above shows the median burn rate of publicly traded SaaS companies by year. It’s called cash from operations on their financial statements. By year two the companies are burning about $4M per year which ramps to $10M from years 3-5 and then decreases as the company scales revenue to about break even. There’s a huge variance in the data but I think the median is an accurate representation of what I’ve seen in the market today. When determining how much cash your startup should spend perform a bottom-up financial plan and a top-down analysis like the one above to ensure your startup is always in a position to raise capital at a more attractive valuation than the previous round.

http://tomtunguz.com/three-types-of-managers/,Crossing the People Management Chasm: A Necessity of Startup Growth,Crossing the People Management Chasm: A Necessity of Startup Growth One of the hardest but least spoken about transitions in a startup’s life is crossing people management chasm. At the outset of the startup there might be three people then eight then fifteen. As they grow startups often create ad hoc managers I call team leads. Team leads manage 3 to 5 people. They work alongside their team whether engineering sales or marketing and contribute actively to achieving the goals of that team team. They code sell or market for 50% of their time. With the remainder team leads coordinate team members set goals and measure progress. In company sizes around 30 to 50 or so team lead structures work well. As the company scales the number of team leads in the business grows so someone must be appointed to manage the team leads. This is the people management chasm. The manager of team leads isn’t a team lead himself because he doesn’t actively contribute to any one of his team’s output - there’s not enough time to do both well. He’s a different kind of manager a team builder. The team builder is responsible for cultivating the people within that team recruiting and hiring additional members of the team and guiding the team to perform at a high level. The team builder spends 90%+ of his time in one-on-one meetings recruiting meetings and progress evaluation meetings. CEOs are team builders almost from the very first day of a startup’s life. Crossing the people management chasm hiring the first people manager is challenging. After all the interview process used to evaluate individual contributors is no longer valid. Nor will annual review processes work - the metrics to evaluate a manager’s performance differ from an individual contributor. Suddenly all the criteria have changed. What got you here won’t get you there. At this point the startup has to develop another competency: how to hire and manage people managers. Like other skills successful startups research this competency by speaking with experts solicit advice from well-known and successful managers and founders who have done this before. They speak with recruiters before launching search processes about the kinds of managers who will fit best into their startup’s culture and they iterate on their interview and evaluation processes. Crossing this chasm is the key to growing the business. It’s not easy but it’s essential. Published 2013-09-12,Published 2013-09-12
http://tomtunguz.com/intellectual-honesty/,Brutal Intellectual Honesty,Brutal Intellectual Honesty I’ve been reading a book called Legacy Of Ashes which is an exhaustive history of the CIA since its founding more than 50 years ago through to 2007. Reading spy stories is always enthralling but surprisingly the book is a fascinating case study in management. The major theme of the book is the value of intellectual honesty a principle which was often forgotten according to the research compiled by the author. In case after case from the Korean War to the Bay of Pigs invasion to the second Gulf War there were consistent organizational failures to present candid assessments of data and a consistent pattern of deception to further political motives. In contrast Dominic Orr the CEO of Aruba Networks describes his management philosophy of brutal intellectual honesty in this 4 minute Stanford video. I’m paraphrasing a bit here but this is the kernel of wisdom from the video: Brutal intellectual honesty. There are too many decisions to make in too little time. You want to get all the facts on the table have an honest debate for a period of time and at the end of the time make a decision and go. Once ego becomes involved people have to find a way to save face which is incredibly time wasting. And if you recall time is the only competitive resource we have. According to Dominic to elicit intellectual honesty from a management team demands coaching and counseling team members individually so each person is comfortable enough in their environment and confident enough in their own opinions to speak their mind freely. Only then can a team determine the best route to pursue. This is not an easy task but all great teams have this working relationship. It’s something we all should aspire to achieve.

http://tomtunguz.com/public-market-delay-reward/,Are SaaS Startups Today Worth More than Ten Years Ago?,Are SaaS Startups Today Worth More than Ten Years Ago? In the Runaway Train of Late Stage Fundraising I analyzed the growing disparity of the public and private markets. Ten years ago we saw 2-10x as many IPOs as $40M+ rounds. Today we see 16x as many $40M+ growth rounds as IPOs. There’s no question that companies are waiting longer to go public fueled by late stage private investment. I was wondering if as a consequence we might see bigger IPOs. Surprisingly the answer so far is no. The chart above shows the average market capitalization at IPO for recent software IPOs. The figures are adjusted for inflation. Though the chart demonstrates some variance from year to year there’s actually no statistically significant difference in the average market cap of a SaaS company going public today compared to ten years ago. It’s about $900M. When the companies do go public they raise about $140M. Again this amount when adjusted for inflation hasn’t changed over the past decade. Nor has the float (the fraction of share the business sells to raise money) changed materially over the same time period. In other words public market investors are investing on the same terms in software companies today as a decade ago. One could argue that the majority of the private market darlings which has raised enormous war chests have yet to go public and consequently haven’t impacted these figures yet. However there are a few examples of such businesses which have gone out. Namely New Relic ($215M raised $1.0B market cap) Box ($561M raised $1.6B market cap at IPO) HortonWorks ($200M raised $0.6B market cap at IPO). We’re certain to see many more data points surface in the next year or two and I’ll be keeping an eye on the trend. I’m curious if there is a correlation between dollars raised and market cap at IPO. Though I haven’t run the analysis I suspect there likely isn’t because while some businesses do seem to require hundred of millions to go public others like Veeva and Tableau make do on less than $20M each. So given the data we have today we have to conclude public markets are treating high flying software companies the same today as over the past decade even if private market investors are far more bullish.

http://tomtunguz.com/history-of-the-valley/,Silicon Valley's Library,Silicon Valley's Library When I was a teenager I read a book called Barbarians at the Gate about KKR’s leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco. Two journalists detail the dramatic struggle for power and control of the company between Henry Kravis of KKR and Nabisco’s CEO Ross Johnson. From that point I was hooked on business history. In the valley there’s a massive collection of verbal history that is passed around. There are anecdotes of Google’s early days with a high burn rate personal chefs unbending founders and without a business model in sight; the handful of times Netflix had just enough cash to make payroll that week; the tactics and psychology behind LinkedIn Series B pitch deck; the genesis stories of YC starlets Those yarns enthrall me because they reveal the relationships the biases and passions that form the truth from one observer’s point of view about how and why things unfolded the way they did. Many of these events effected dramatic change on the technology landscape. Today there is no place to collect those stories. Quora has bits and pieces of that lore. Blogs capture scraps. Books like Steven Levy’s In the Plex and Hatching Twitter also collect the stories through a journalist’s lens. But these are distributed and limited to one person’s point of view. I hope one day such a Wikipedia of tech history comes into existence that validates identity collects tales from the protagonists and distributes to entrepreneurs who can read them dissect them and learn from them. What a Library of Alexandria it would be for the world of technology and startups. Published 2013-10-18,Published 2013-10-18
http://tomtunguz.com/working-backwards/,Reverse Engineering Your Startup’s Success,Reverse Engineering Your Startup’s Success Who can forget gems like these word problems from 3rd grade math class? Q: Jack walked from Santa Clara to Palo Alto. It took 1 hour 25 minutes to walk from Santa Clara to Los Altos. Then it took 25 minutes to walk from Los Altos to Palo Alto. He arrived in Palo Alto at 2:45 P.M. At what time did he leave Santa Clara? It was during those classes that our mathematics teachers taught us how to work backwards through the problem. A: You can work backwards from the time Jack reached Palo Alto. Subtract the time it took to walk from Los Altos to Palo Alto. Then subtract the time it took to walk from Santa Clara to Los Altos. Working backwards is one of the most important skills founders and startups employ because it’s a technique to reverse engineer success. It means planting a flag in the ground and asking “How do we get there with what assets and constraints we have?” This is true for growth marketing fund raising hiring financial planning management and many other functions of startups. At last week’s Growth Hacking conference Eliot Schmuckler responsible for growth at LinkedIn and now VP of Product & Growth at Wealthfront presented his techniques for driving growth. First he defines the right growth goal a single most important number. Second he determines the growth drivers by working backwards from his goal. How many users does he need when? Which growth channels will provide what fraction of his users? Under which circumstances can his funnels grow to meet the desired targets for growth? How must his team ramp growth to accomplish the goal? Coincidentally I met a head of marketing candidate for a portfolio company last week. When I asked him about his marketing methodology he said “I measure gross margin by cohort and work backwards from there.” He was embodying Schmuckler’s advice. Some of my recent posts like Hiring Your Start up’s First Salesperson and The Most Important Principle of Fund Raising work backwards from constraints to make an argument about how best to think about fund raising and when to start building a sales team. Working backwards isn’t always the best technique. Agile product engineering and management favor iterative development and tend to avoid longer term planning which can be particularly valuable when discovering product market fit and iterating quickly. But working backwards does work well in cases when longer term plans are required. By identifying goals and constraints we can find reverse engineer solutions within those parameters.

http://tomtunguz.com/investor-location-round-size/,The Impact of Investor Geography on Your Seed Series A and B Check Size,The Impact of Investor Geography on Your Seed Series A and B Check Size When we analyzed the impact of location on a startup’s ability to raise capital we found no statistically significant difference. Startups in San Francisco Seattle Pittsburgh Austin and many other cities all demonstrated similar ability to raise follow-on rounds. But is the same true for investors of various locations? Do investors across the US invest similarly across Seed Series A and Series B? They do not. In fact there is a statistically significant difference in investment patterns of investors depending on their location. The table below contrasts the mean round sizes across Seed Series A and Series B by investor headquarters location across firms in California Massachusetts and New York 1 . Round Sizes in $M CA MA NY Seed 1.1 1.1 1.1 Series A 5.8 6.1 5.0 Series B 13.3 11.3 12.8 Lowest Statistically Different Values Marked in Red Lowest Statistically Different Values Marked in Red Lowest Statistically Different Values Marked in Red Lowest Statistically Different Values Marked in Red Investors in these three states invest similarly at the seed stage. But New York investors write 16-22% smaller Series A checks than their counterparts in CA and MA. Massachusetts investors invest 13-18% less than New York or Californian investors in Series B. T-Tests in both cases produce p-values of 0.0002 or smaller indicating the values are statistically different. First let me debunk a fallacious conclusion that founders should raise Series As only in CA and MA and Series Bs in CA and NY. While there are differences in the average investment size the two charts below illustrate investors in each of these three geographies underwrite investments of all sizes. The major difference across markets is the relative frequency of smaller and larger investments in aggregate. In certain geographies investors in aggregate are likelier to underwrite larger investments. To convey this point about investment frequency I’ve plotted the distribution of investment by size for the three different investor states in Series As and Bs. It’s plain to see investors in each of these three geographies have underwritten investments of all sizes but the relative occurrence of different round size varies by state. The chart makes plain NY-based investors’ preference for smaller Series As . The yellow curve indicates the most common Series A round from NYC-based investors is around $3M compared to $5M in CA and MA. Interestingly Series A investments by California and Massachusetts firms display spikes at $5 $10 and $15M indicating these round numbers have become de facto standard investment sizes. More importantly it implies entrepreneurs are able to negotiate investment size not based on the cash needs of the business but perceived value of the company. A parallel chart for Series Bs demonstrates a unique different investment behavior by MA investors who invest much more frequently in smaller Series Bs. Curiously NYC based investors tend to write more $40M+ checks on a relative basis than either MA or CA investors. These differing investment patterns may have many causes. NY investors may be writing Series A term sheets at earlier stages in startup life-cycles; and the same might be true in Series Bs for Boston investors. Startup sectors may be more or less in vogue in certain cities and different sectors may have wildly different capital needs. For example local delivery companies and ecommerce companies tend to require more capital than others because they generate substantially smaller gross margins than most enterprise companies increasing the required round size. There may be more competition in certain rounds in particular regions because firms in that region have decided to focus on Series As or Bs; there may be a different distribution of fund sizes by state. Or it could be regional difference in terms such as pre-money valuations ownership thresholds or employee stock option plan sizes. Whatever the cause the data should encourage founders to ensure the firms they might engage in fundraising talks have underwritten similar investments to the type the company would like to raise. And the data also supports the idea that soliciting terms from investors across geographies is the best way to obtain market price for their equity. 1 I’ve used Crunchbase data for this analysis from 2011 through October 2014. Crunchbase attributes investments made by multi-geo funds like Bessemer Matrix CRV to only one geography in this case CA CA and MA repectively which introduces some noise into the analysis.

http://tomtunguz.com/narcissism-of-small-differences/,A Five Year Android User Switches To iOS,A Five Year Android User Switches To iOS On the day of Android’s five year launch anniversary and my fifth consecutive year of using exclusively Android devices I switched to a yellow iPhone 5c. Like a well worn pair of jeans it’s easy to grow accustomed to a mobile phone OS. Changing into a new pair is always a little uncomfortable at first. In that same way migrating from Android to I iOS I discovered the quirks and kinks of each OS: The iOS keyboard always shows uppercase letters no matter if the letter being typed is upper or lowercase. On Android the letters on the keyboard change case as you type. On iOS’s Gmail client you swipe to the left to archive a message. On Android it’s to the right. To switch between applications on the iPhone 5c double tap the home button and swipe left/right. On my Droid Razr M tap the app switching button and swipe up/down. The default background color on iOS is white. On Android it’s black. The volume rocker and power button are on the right side of the iPhone and the left of the Android. These phones mirror each other Spy vs Spy embodied in circuitry and aluminum and glass. Having spent five years isolated on one platform and switched immersed in the competing platform I’m surprised to see how similar iOS and Android have become. The corollary to this similarity is of course how easy it is to switch between the two. We’ve reached the point in mobile phone evolution that Freud would call the narcissism of small differences. As Clive Hazell puts it [In] postmodernity consumer culture has been seen as predicated on ‘the “narcissism of small differences”…to achieve a superficial sense of one’s own uniqueness an ersatz sense of otherness which is only a mask for an underlying uniformity and sameness’. Setting aside the processor arms race the main product differentiation in mobile hardware has evolved to mobile phone customization. Will you have a backplate made of chartreuse plastic or rosewood? Of course Android’s ecosystem is mildly inferior driven by lesser revenue opportunity that I suspect will be resolved with the growth in user base time affords. Because the differences between the operating systems and hardware are trivial and the sizes of the user bases are comparable it seems to me that over time the Android and iOS will become true substitutes in the way MacOS and Windows never were.

http://tomtunguz.com/where-have-the-ipos-gone/,Profitability and the IPO Market,Profitability and the IPO Market It’s a common refrain that venture backed IPOs have struggled in the past decade. For a long time I believed and wrote supporting arguments underscoring the idea that the principal causes of this decline were Sarbanes-Oxley costs decreasing equity coverage and decimalization of exchanges. But that’s wrong. A paper published earlier this year uses statistics to debunk these hypotheses. In “Where have all the IPOs gone?” a team of statisticians concludes small cap tech IPOs are struggling because today’s public candidates aren’t profitable when then file. Nor are they very profitable at all. Small Caps Are Unprofitable and Don’t Turn the Corner Below is a chart copied from the paper that shows the unprofitable percentage of small IPOs (those with less than $50M in trailing 12 months' revenue) and large IPOs. The fraction of small IPOs with negative EBITDA has doubled to nearly 90% in about 30 years. Small IPOs Large IPOs Number % < 0 Number % < 0 1980-1989 508 44% 168 21% 1990-1998 979 65% 411 31% 1999-2000 472 90% 120 72% 2001-2009 192 79% 186 34% Once public profits don’t improve. In the last 20 years 80% of small cap companies hadn’t generated a profit in the first 3 years after IPO. Public investors punished them for it. Small caps share prices fell -10%. On the other hand large caps grew in value by 27% in the same period. 80% of these companies generated profits in the 3 years following the IPO. (See pages 38 and 39 of the paper). In short small caps are utterly unattractive investment candidates for public market investors. With all the talk about the decreasing costs to start a company because of the cloud and elastic computing why are today’s small companies less profitable and ultimately far less successful in the public markets? It’s a conundrum - a secret in Thiel’s language. Reasons for Small Cap Struggles I don’t have the answer. But there are several theories. First board directors are encouraging companies to remain unprofitable longer to pursue bigger outcomes. Second the tech industry’s structure lends itself to economies of scale require small companies to operate at a significant disadvantage. Third the decreasing costs of starting a company are increasing competition and eroding margins. Startups may be managed differently. For example Documentum filed for IPO in 1996 with $15M in ttm revenue and $0.5M in profit. MMC Networks filed in 1998 with $14M in ttm revenue and $0.5M in profit. We don’t see these IPOs today. Instead venture capital growth funds are financing these companies at these stages. Perhaps these investors are encouraging companies to continue to finance growth with negative profits a trend that continues through the public offering but ultimately isn’t the best decision for shareholders. The authors of the paper speculate economies of scale are to play - larger companies operate more efficient sales channels close higher value customers and leverage distribution strength to develop near monopolies. As a result smaller companies face greater costs in bringing products to market because of longer sales cycles and greater competition. This argument favors stronger FTC involvement in anti-trust regulation. Lastly perhaps the decreasing costs of starting tech companies are creating more entrants. Without significant barriers to entry new entrants use lower prices and freemium strategies to win market share. Such strategies ultimately reduce price points and decrease the value of a market reducing profitability for all market players. No matter the cause this paper does underscore the value of building a profitable business is disproportionately rewarded in the public markets for small cap companies.

http://tomtunguz.com/hardware-investment-trends/,How Vibrant is the Hardware Startup World?,How Vibrant is the Hardware Startup World? It would seem hardware startups are booming. First the amazing success of the GoPro business and IPO which set a 23-year high-water mark for a consumer hardware company. Second there seems to be a growing number of hardware startups bubbling in incubators like Lemnos Labs and Highway1. Third Kickstarter and other crowdfunding sites have enabled hardware startups to mitigate one of the biggest risks in starting out: obtaining a reliable proxy for consumer demand. But do the data support the idea that the hardware ecosystem is as vibrant as it seems? The chart above shows the sizes and frequency of hardware investment in the US since 2010 across different investment stages (Series A B C and Seed) using Crunchbase data. Each investment is a red circle. Each plot also shows a linear trend line for round sizes in gray. The most salient data point from the chart is the sudden increase in the sizes of hardware seed rounds in the past 24 month or so. Before 2013 there were very few hardware seed rounds exceeding $1M but in 2013 56% of seed stage hardware companies that raised rounds raised more than $1M. Other segments of the market namely Series A B and C have kept their typical investment size relatively constant. The bar chart above shows the investment pace by year by Series. Note the 2014 data is through May. Series As and Series Seed volumes spiked dramatically in 2013 more than doubling the previous years’ investment counts. Series C is relatively constant and Series B varies a bit but I suspect mostly because the volumes are relatively small. Only about 5 hardware companies raise Series Bs each year according to this data set. I wonder how the 2014 market will evolve. On one hand the seed volumes this year are much smaller than I expected but that may be due to companies operating in stealth rather than an actual decline in investment activity. I’ll have to wait for the Crunchbase data to fill in before drawing a conclusion. Overall though there’s no question hardware startups have witnessed a recent surge particularly in the seed market both in number of seeds raised and the average sizes of those seeds. In 2013 these hardware startups raised nearly twice as many Series As as the preceding few years a strong positive signal. Hardware is in vogue and hardware startups are attracting the capital they need to grow in greater and greater numbers. Published 2014-07-08,Published 2014-07-08
http://tomtunguz.com/free-compute/,The Innovations Free Compute and Storage Unleash,The Innovations Free Compute and Storage Unleash What will the world look like when cloud compute and storage are free? Cloud computing prices are hurtling to zero. The chart above shows the logarithmic decline of the cost of a transistor cycle by 11 orders of magnitude (11 decimal places) over the past 40 years. AWS has decreased prices for EC2 elastic compute cloud and S3 simple storage service 42 times in eight years. Storage is following a similar path. Dropbox is now selling 1TB for $10 per month and Google offers 10TB for $100 per month. Meanwhile gigabit internet has been deployed in about 8 cities in the US so far with another 12 to 15 slated for next year typically at $70-$100 monthly price points. Presuming the trend continues and computational power becomes free or near free what new technologies are enabled by it? The first manifestation of large scale near-free compute I’ve seen is in machine learning. When I worked at Google in 2005 we would test individual machine learning models one or two at a time. Today it’s possible for any company to test millions of machine learning models in parallel in minutes by distributing the work across tens hundreds or thousands of machines with the push of a button. These advances will shape the next era of SaaS companies and consumer companies pursuing anticipatory computing and nearly everything in between. The second manifestation is Bitcoin which could become the next major protocol for the internet. Bitcoin miners use huge amount of processing power to validate transactions between buyer and seller of the currency. Without access to this computing power the blockchain which is the ledger of all Bitcoin accounts could quickly be hacked and the currency destabilized. The third manifestation is next-generation databases like Redshift that enable data processing on a massive scale with sub-second response times. The benefits of these databases have already cascaded to business intelligence and will undoubtedly benefit other fields. Access to near-unlimited computational power and storage will define many of the key technology innovations in the next decade. This transformation enables startups to challenge the first order assumptions about what can and can’t be done and will surely lead to explosive innovation. Published 2014-09-12,Published 2014-09-12
http://tomtunguz.com/negative-churn/,Why Negative Churn is Such a Powerful Growth Mechanism,Why Negative Churn is Such a Powerful Growth Mechanism Negative churn is an incredibly attractive characteristic of a SaaS company because it means that customer accounts are like high-yield savings accounts. Every month more money comes in without much effort. This is a powerful effect and can fuel SaaS companies to huge success as we saw in New Relic’s S-1. The concept of negative churn is a bit amorphous so let’s illustrate the impact on a startup. The chart above plots the revenue growth of a hypothetical SaaS company for a year. This startup acquires 100 customers per month each paying $1 per month to use the product. And the company loses 5% of those customers each month so only about half of the January cohort remains in December. Contrast this with a company which has achieved 5% negative churn. In other words the company still loses 5% of its customer base each month but the remaining 95% of the customers grow their spend with the startup by 10 percentage points so the total revenue from the cohort is equal to 105% of the revenue from the previous month. Like a savings account each month every cohort becomes more valuable. 5% Monthly Churn -5% Monthly Churn Total Revenue in December 919 1592 Mean Cohort Revenue in December 77 133 In the 5% monthly churn case the startup exits 2014 with $919 in MRR (monthly recurring revenue) and the typical customer is worth $77. In the negative churn case the startup’s revenue is 73% larger at $1592 and the average customer is worth $133. In both cases the business has the same number of customers. But in the negative churn case the startup has been able to grow their accounts. Not all businesses can grow their accounts this way. But many companies do. The main modes of account growth I’ve seen are: Seat expansion: sell the product to more people within the company and charge by the seat (ex. Salesforce Expensify) Resource expansion: entice the customer to store more data or use more of your service (ex. New Relic Twilio Heroku) Cross-sell: sell adjacent products that increases the value of the core product (ex. AWS S3 EMR etc) But I suspect there are other categories too. And of course in many cases the customer success team is responsible for this type of expansion. There are some important nuances to negative churn as Ferenc points out in his post on the topic. Namely negative churn is an average and for most companies customers’ revenue follows a power law distribution (the old 80 ⁄20 rule where 20% of customers generate 80% of revenues). So one customer can create negative churn if that customer’s spending increases dramatically. Meanwhile the company may hemorrhaging the majority of its customer base. Looking only at revenue churn wouldn’t reveal the potential cataclysm. This is why it’s important to pay attention to both revenue and account churn. Combined with annual prepay contracts negative churn is a very powerful growth mechanism. When thinking through your pricing model and your customer success strategy it’s worth trying to engineer negative churn into your startup. Published 2014-11-18,Published 2014-11-18
http://tomtunguz.com/churn/,Why Customer Success Is An Essential Part of Every SaaS Startup,Why Customer Success Is An Essential Part of Every SaaS Startup If a typical SaaS business loses about 2 to 3% of their customers each month to churn the business must grow by at least 27% to 43% annually to maintain the same revenue. The idea written as an equation: Revenue Growth = Customers x Avg. Contract Value x (Growth Rate - Churn Rate) At the beginning of a SaaS startups' life when the company generates $1M in annual revenue churn in absolute dollar terms is small about $300k for the year. This number is particularly easy to write off if the company is growing quickly perhaps tripling to $3M in revenue next year. Fast forward two or three years to a SaaS company generating $15M per year and churn is now $5M per year. Then two or three years later that number could be $10M or $20M. As a startup becomes a growth stage company churn’s importance grows substantially because the startup is beginning to fight the downward pressure of sales efficiency slowing. New sales processes take more effort and time and expense. Fast growth doesn’t mask churn rates as it once did and the absolute revenue-at-risk numbers are measured in the millions or tens of millions. At this stage the internal capability to save revenue dollars at risk by engaging customers becomes paramount to continuing to grow the business. But scaling a team from nothing to one that can save $10M per year is no mean feat. If one account manager can handle $500k of revenue at risk per year the customer success team must be 20 people. This is why customer success must be a core discipline of SaaS startups from the very first day. In addition to being able to scale the team with revenue/churn the customer success team is on the front lines with customers passing feedback to product and marketing. Customer success provides a check on the sales team ensuring the right customers are prioritized and closed. Investing early and often in customer success is essential to keeping a fast-growing SaaS business’s momentum. Published 2013-10-11,Published 2013-10-11
http://tomtunguz.com/machine-learning-in-consumer-products/,Machine Learning in Consumer Products,Machine Learning in Consumer Products I believe machine learning will drive the next big wave of innovation in consumer web services. The very same technologies that power Google’s search and Netflix video recommendation engine will become far more common and useful perhaps even predominant in the consumer web. Every great consumer product has a little bit of magic. Apple employs static software and hardware design to anticipate user needs - to create that magic. Compared to user experience design and forethought intelligence when it works is far more compelling and impressive. Most of the time though it’s easy to be disappointed. If you’re anything like me the first time you played with Siri you tried to find places where it failed. We expect and to a degree have been trained to expect the technology to fail. Like Dorothy we all look behind the curtain to find the little man making the magic the Mechanical Turk. But ML and deep learning have reached a point that makes it harder and harder to pull back the curtain and expose weak technology. Google and Nuance speech recognition are truly useful because they work with very high degrees of accuracy. Netflix’s content recommendation Facebook’s EdgeGraph LinkedIn recommendations Twitter’s Discover Google Now - each one of these products improves every day. For machine learning to create magic the the technology requires large amounts of data the infrastructure to process the data and the algorithms to extract learning. The data sets relevant to consumer products are the data sets consumers create themselves: watch lists click streams intent to buy expression and sharing patterns. And with the growth of smart phone penetration and tablet growth and time spent on the web and identity systems more and more of human interaction with services and with others is recorded (for better or worse). These data sets grow at exponential rates on an individual basis improving the predictive ability for each user. Second the infrastructure to process the data is readily available. Google Facebook LinkedIn and others have open sourced Hadoop Cassandra Storm and other data processing systems that run on commodity infrastructure and scale horizontally. These systems are capable of analyzing data at close to the rates that users produce them. Last the combination of huge amounts of data available and the infrastructure to process it opens the doors to deep learning. This finally makes possible techniques like artificial neural networks which were previously constrained by lack of processing capacity. In the next five years machine learning will appear in everything from books to dating sites from travel recommendations to insurance quotes. And opening the doors below the chess board there won’t be a chess grand master masquerading but a data center. Published 2013-03-12,Published 2013-03-12
http://tomtunguz.com/inevitability/,The Secret Ingredient to the Best Startup Fundraising Pitches,The Secret Ingredient to the Best Startup Fundraising Pitches I’ve listened to thousands of fundraising pitches in my six years so far at Redpoint. Some with demos some without. Some with hockey-stick charts and others just an idea. I’ll never forget one meeting when the founders presented an entirely hand-drawn deck on 12 pieces of paper. The extent of founders’ creativity is hard to over-state. Most founders do cover the essentials of a pitch in their presentations. But what distinguishes the best pitches? It’s a question I hear all the time from founders looking to polish their pitch. In addition to assuaging the 11 Risks VCs Evaluate the best fundraising pitches convince prospective investors of inevitability. The most successful pitches argue the market will unfold inexorably in the way the founders envision on a relevant time scale. And that this startup in particular will dominate share in that new world. There is no prescriptive way I can recommend to consistently argue inevitability. Some founders use data. Others use logic. Still others use emotion and passion to do it. But in the end these exceptional storytellers make you want to believe suspend doubt and disregard the great risks that all startups face all along their journey and get involved with the business. The best resource I’ve found for understanding the techniques of great storytellers is Nancy Duarte’s book Resonate. It’s the only book that explains the cadence and structure of great storytellers comparing and contrasting Steve Jobs’ style with Richard Feynman’s and many others. There is a craft to creating a pitch that conveys inevitability. It takes time and thought and effort. But investing the time to sculpt that story is well worth the work. The story will yield dividends during every investor meeting press conference and candidate interview. Published 2014-08-01,Published 2014-08-01
http://tomtunguz.com/why-did-apples-unwillingness-to-compromise-finally-succeed/,Why did Apple’s unwillingness to compromise finally succeed?,Why did Apple’s unwillingness to compromise finally succeed? Apple has built the most successful tech ecosystem of the past ten years. And they have done it surprisingly by dictating the rules of that ecosystem. Compare iOS and Android. To win both needed to develop initially 2 but eventually 3 things: A mobile OS Mobile hardware to run the OS And later the content ecosystem Apple controls nearly every aspect of this stack from the prices of books and movies to the place where apps are downloaded to the payment mechanisms down to the advertising and user tracking. Incredibly this worked. The movie studios agreed. Book publishers agreed. App developers agreed. Users agreed (and supplied 400M credit cards). By total ecosystem revenue Apple has built an ecosystem 6.5 times larger than Android: Apple has paid $5B to developers and Google less than $750M. Each ecosystem and its history are very different. Apple’s early ecosystem commanded a very small group of die-hard developers to build complementary applications on proprietary hardware. On the other hand Windows embraced commoditization of hardware to win share and build a massive ecosystem. More recently Facebook built an ecosystem as a by product of sheer user growth of their core product. Twitter created and destroyed their ecosystem of clients and are now building a new data ecosystem. Apple will always be defined by its unwillingness to compromise. iOS is no different. The question I have is why did this unwillingness to compromise suddenly work? Published 2012-06-11,Published 2012-06-11
http://tomtunguz.com/second-seeds/,Second Seed Rounds: How They Impact a Startup's Ability to Raise a Series A,Second Seed Rounds: How They Impact a Startup's Ability to Raise a Series A The market for startups raising capital has changed dramatically over the past few years. Round sizes have ballooned: startups raise 50%+ larger rounds than a few years ago. The looming Series A crunch never occurred. Instead we’ve seen the bifurcation of the Series B market. Series Bs are the spring of hope for some startups who raise megarounds and the winter of despair for others who must compete for increasingly scarce Series B dollars. Meanwhile the seed market is evolving even more rapidly. Seed investors raised $3B in 2013 up 6x from 2011. In addition VCs are altering the dynamics of the seed market increasing seed round sizes by 4x. As a consequence of all this turbulence there’s a relatively new but important phenomenon I’ve noticed in the seed market: the Second Seed round. Some startups raise an initial seed round of somewhere between $100k-$1M and six to nine months later they raise an additional $1M or so. But how common is this second seed round? And how are the Series A fortunes of a startup with a second seed round impacted? Second Seed rounds have grown dramatically in frequency since 2009 as the chart at the top of the post shows reaching about 100 in 2013. The number of these seeds recorded in Crunchbase data has grown by 140% annually from only 3 in 2009. This analysis considers only initial seeds greater than $100k that are followed by another seed round for startups in the US. Though 98 seems like a small number these seed financings represent 7.5% of the reported seed financings in 2013 (of those with disclosed financing amounts). Second Seeds have increased in frequency from about 2% to 7.5% in 2013. These rounds are no longer rare. As Second Seeds increase in prevalence we can begin to study the impact on a startup’s ability to raise follow on capital. One one hand startups that raise Second Seeds haven’t built enough momentum to raise Series As (presuming that’s their goal). On the other hand a Second Seed provides a startup more time to generate greater momentum and achieve milestones to catalyze a Series A financing. Let's compare the fundraising success of startups which raised one seed and those that raised two. The bar chart above contrasts the Series A follow-rate of startups following different seed strategies. Although the Second Seed startups record a 15.8% success rate a 10% increase compared to the 13.6% success rate of single seeded companies the difference isn't statistically significant. The potential signaling risk of a second seed is immaterial. As for the typical Series A raised by the two different populations of startups the conclusion is the same. Both single and double seeded startups raise statistically comparable Series As somewhere between 4-5 million. Dilution may be the only meaningful difference between a startup which raises one seed and a startup that raises two seeds. But the difference in founder ownership is dependent on the terms of each of those two rounds. Unfortunately we don’t have that data available to analyze. Second Seeds have become much more common in the past four years. And as long as the Series A market continues to boom we will continue to see Second Seeds. For some founders this new financial product the Second Seed may be just the right financial product to lock in a great Series A. Published 2014-10-06,Published 2014-10-06
http://tomtunguz.com/seed-size-impact-seriesa/,Do Larger Seed Rounds Lead to Bigger Series As?,Do Larger Seed Rounds Lead to Bigger Series As? In What’s Up with the Series A Nikhil Basu Trivedi documents the bifurcation in the Series A market. While there are a handful of startups that raise blockbuster Series As of greater than $10M the average Series A investment size remains relatively constant over the past 6 years just around $5.3M for US technology companies according to Crunchbase data[1]. After reading his post I wondered if a big seed round is a leading indicator of a big series A. In other words would larger seed rounds provide enough negotiating leverage in fundraising conversations to bolster average check sizes and increase pre-money valuations? Let’s go to the data. Below is a chart of 726 startups who raised a seed and a follow-on Series A anytime from 2005-2013. The x-axis is the size of the seed round in $k and the y-axis is the size of the Series A in $M. Each dot represents one startup. There isn’t a clear pattern within the data but we can make three important observations. First Series As rarely exceed $10M for companies with seed stage financing and the distribution of these financings tends to be relatively independent of seed investment size. Second in the top right we see a cluster of large-seed and large Series A companies but the sample size is quite small only 4. Third the correlation between the size of the seed round and the size of the Series A is tenuous at about 0.25 R^2. I can’t argue larger seed rounds precede larger As. But there is a nugget of useful insight in the data. Below I’ve charted the distribution of seed investments by size on the left and the distribution of Series A investmens by size on the right. They are quite different. Seed investments are uniformly distributed but Series A investments follow a power-law distribution. Fundraising is never simple or easy but there is a marked difference in the difficulty of raising a large seed compared to large A. Roughly 18% of startups in this data set raised a $1.5M+ series seed but fewer than 8.5% of these startups raised a Series A of greater than $10M. Said another way there is 3x more capital available for sub-$10M Series As than for greater than $10M As. In contrast the amount of capital invested in seeds greater than $1M is about twice as big compared to small seeds which is quite likely an artifact of the rise of the dedicated seed fund and traditional VCs’ entry into the seed market. All in all larger seeds may not have a strong effect on the size of the Series A a startup can raise. But at least at this point in the market it’s becoming easier for founders to raise substantial seed rounds. [1] The numbers I’m using here differ from Nikhil’s because in addition to geography I filtered the industry to tech companies which seem to garner larger investments than the average Series A.

http://tomtunguz.com/hot-sectors-2014/,The Hottest Startup Sectors,The Hottest Startup Sectors There’s a cyclicality to fundraising. Certain sectors rise quickly and become competitive while others decline. I’ve been wondering about the state of the market. First which sectors are in vogue now in Seed investing and Series A investing? Second is there a delay between the sectors attracting seed capital and Series A capital? In other words do seed investors see trends before VCs do? The chart above shows the trends in the seed investment market. This data is Crunchbase data filtered for the largest 20 or so sectors from 2010-2013. Each graph shows the fraction of relevant seeds in a particular segment over time. The hottest sectors those with a sudden increase in seed investment share include some obvious ones: Hardware + Software Health and Wellness and Messaging. The hardware startup movement has been catapulted by the success of crowdfunding and the quantified self movement has amassed some tremendous momentum as well. More interestingly though there are a few surprises: Automotive ECommerce and Fashion. The sectors in decline include Advertising a challenging sector because of the market dominance of Google and Facebook and Big Data whose investment share had spiked two years ago creating a swell of competition and Android. Let’s contrast the seed investment patterns with Series A patterns. I ran the same analysis for the top 20 or sectors in the Series A market. The patterns are similar but not identical. Some winners like Hardware + Software Health and Wellness and ECommerce are consistent. But Automotive and Fashion didn’t garner large enough Series A share to surface in this analysis. Series A investors seem to be more bullish on Android companies than seed investors do; perhaps it’s an artifact of latency. The Android startups which raised seeds in 2011 and 2012 raised As in 2013. Series A investors are pursuing Analytics with more gusto than seed investors. Which raises the question how quickly do Series A investors respond to the trends in the seed market? The chart below overlays the Series A trends across the Seed categories in the top chart of this post. Looking at the data on an annual basis and though there are exceptions Series A investors quickly respond to trends in the seed market. In fact the investment patterns have an annual correlation coefficient of 0.83 indicating a very strong synchronicity. Series A investors follow the patterns set by seed investors or at the very least both tend to invest in the same markets at the same time. Getting a bit more granular we can compare the investment correlation patterns by quarter. Same Quarter +1 Quarter +2 Quarters +3 Quarters +4 Quarters Correlation Coefficient 0.68 0.65 0.63 0.64 0.49 The table above shows the data. The coefficient indicating similar sector investments is highest during the same quarter and degrades slightly for the next three quarters and then falls suddenly nine months later. When a sector becomes hot in the seed market it’s hot for another nine months in the Series A market and then it begins to cool. Published 2014-06-24,Published 2014-06-24
http://tomtunguz.com/marketing-liberation/,Marketing’s Technical Liberation,Marketing’s Technical Liberation Product and engineering teams are inseparable and at the core of most startups. One degree removed sales and customer support teams ply the voice of the customer to influence product and eng. Of the five teams in a startup marketing teams tend to have the least influence because traditional product marketers must influence others to enact change. Marketing works with product and engineering to update branding and communication within the product. Marketing collaborates with sales to refine the product positioning. Marketing relies on engineering to provide analysis for marketing spend efficiency customer segmentation and user engagement. Marketing teams with customer support to ensure service reinforces the company’s brand. In each case marketing is working through others. Sometimes marketing speaks directly to customers through channels like blogs events paid advertising and public relations. Nevertheless marketers mostly influence other teams to enact change. But that’s changing. We’re in the midst of marketing’s technical liberation when technology enables marketing teams to act directly immediately and effectively. Technology is abstracting away many of the interactions between marketing and the other teams in a startup. This trend increases the influence and effectiveness of startup marketing teams. Mobile is the most immediate catalyst for this change. Marketers optimizing organic traffic through SEO are entirely dependent on engineering time to change the structure of the site or of the page. On the other hand the iOS and Android store landing pages can be updated by a marketer with just a few clicks. Website optimization tools like Optimizely and Monetate among others enable marketers to test and refine pages through a point-and-click UI. A handful of startups are bringing these ideas to mobile applications as well. Marketing automation tools like Sailthru create dynamic segments of users on the fly to improve email response rates. Infer sifts through customer databases and uses machine learning to reduce churn and increase upsell. Dynamic creative optimization on Facebook and Google exchanges enable marketers to update ads dynamically. Tag management systems both web and mobile create simple tools for prioritizing ad networks. Looker and others enable marketers to sift through marketing and engagement data without needing the help of a data scientist or engineer. These technologies and others enable marketing to speak directly with the customer change test and tune. By empowering marketing teams with the data to make decisions and the tools to optimize their efforts startups' marketing efficiency will see dramatic growth.

http://tomtunguz.com/observations-of-the-linkedin-influencer-program/,Observations of the LinkedIn Influencer program,Observations of the LinkedIn Influencer program In December I was lucky enough to be asked to become part of the LinkedIn influencer program. I jumped at the opportunity to bring my writing to a broader audience. And the experience has been eye-opening. The influencer program asks a few hundred LinkedIn members to write periodic blog posts which are highlighted on the home page and in email marketing campaigns. LinkedIn staffed a fantastic editorial team who assists writers with content creation and editing but most importantly content marketing. The editorial team delivers relevant content to the right people encouraging a virtuous circle between content creators and their audience to form. Quality content breeds engagement and which entices authors to write more (and attracts new authors). All the while LinkedIn compounds its value. During the past four weeks I syndicated six posts from this blog to LinkedIn. My LinkedIn stats: Below are a few observations from that experience: The traffic is tremendous. My median post generated 15k daily visitors 145 likes and 84 comments - about 15 times the engagement of a post on tomtunguz.com. I needed about three weeks to build a LinkedIn follower count equal in size to Twitter which has been three years in the making. Social networks are the best places for content syndication. What Facebook did for Photos Tumblr did for (animated) gifs Twitter did for news LinkedIn is doing for work content. The same forces that enable these services to quickly build user bases apply to content (both organic and commercial). Relevancy is king. The influencer program succeeds because content is targeted to the user. I’m not sure what tools LinkedIn uses to target content but I bet the technology is analogous to Google’s ad targeting and parallel to Facebook’s EdgeRank. LinkedIn’s audience is broad and interested in general management/self-help topics. Look at the topics in the stats image above and the trend is clear. Most SaaS startups marketing teams should be writing for this platform. Potential customers number in the millions and the influencer program is a targeted and free way to reach them. LinkedIn should build a CRM. I mine Twitter for business development and I’d like to do the same on LinkedIn. The same idea holds for companies marketing on LinkedIn with ads and content. LinkedIn knows identity measures the funnel performance and could store relationship data. I’ll be continuing to blog on LinkedIn. And I’ll also be on the lookout for other forms of social distribution. They are the most powerful forces in content syndication on the Internet today. Published 2013-01-08,Published 2013-01-08

This epitaph captures succinctly so much of leadership: the ability to articulate a vision and convince others of the importance of that mission; the self awareness of knowing one’s strengths and weaknesses; the desire to be the dumbest guy in the room; and the capacity to build and maintain those relationships during a life’s work.

I logged into Facebook today to see this new feature starring your friends. Below this text is a Google circles like UI that asks me to star friends whose updates are particularly important to me. With hundreds of friends the average Facebook user logs in to see wall of updates that aren’t quite relevant. Some of us have reduced our friend graphs and unfriended contacts in order to return the feed to relevance which isn’t a desired user behavior. Facebook after all wants to encourage expansive graphs. The challenge that feeds everywhere face is the local minimum problem. Machine learning algorithms like EdgeRank can easily fall into local minimums where the same people appear on the feed because they’ve been appearing on the feed. The people in the feed become stale and either the model has to be rebuilt or a strong signal must be injected into the algorithm to change results. This beta feature might indicate Facebook is looking for another strong signal of friend-closeness to recenter the feed on the people a user most cares about and return relevance to the feed. Or it might indicate a push to build new features around a top 7 friend list. Published 2012-06-19,Published 2012-06-19
http://tomtunguz.com/engineering-predictability/,How One Startup's Engineering Team Cut their Engineering Release Times in Half,How One Startup's Engineering Team Cut their Engineering Release Times in Half When I worked as an engineer I loved crafting code and feeling the satisfaction of having built something each day. But there was one thing about coding I never grew to love despite its importance: forecasting my coding time. Every two weeks I trudged into a planning meeting that exposed my incompetent forecasting. During these meetings each person in turn would review their commitments for the last two weeks and provide an update. Inevitably I was wildly off. Chalk it up to inexperience exuberance or ineptitude but I never developed the knack. In contrast one of the companies I work with Axial has honed and refined their ability to forecast promise and deliver code with remarkable consistency. A few quarters ago the company implemented Joel Spolsky’s Evidence Based Scheduling techniques which enabled Axial’s engineering team to more than halve their release schedule times. Recently Matt Story head of engineering at Axial spoke about the company’s transition. As the data in Matt’s presentation (embedded below) shows the benefits to the company are hard to overstate. A dependable release schedule frees engineers to work uninterrupted enables marketing and sales teams to make promises and meet their commitments to customers and eliminates the familiar but stressful management by crisis. Predictability at Axial from Matt Story Evidence Based Scheduling is a simple but effective tool for orchestrating an engineering team. As here are three steps to implementing EBS. First break down tasks into smaller chunks measured in hours. More granular estimates are more accurate. Second passively measure each engineer’s actual times to completion and use the data to train the engineering team to estimate better. Third forecast completion dates using simple Monte Carlo simulations. The data is incontrovertible. As Matt so elegantly phrases it in his slides embedded below Predictability vs Speed is a false choice. Published 2014-01-22,Published 2014-01-22
http://tomtunguz.com/box-ipo/,Benchmarking Box's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking Box's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up Yesterday Box filed for its IPO and released its S-1. I enjoy going through S-1s because quite a bit about a private company is revealed and though only a subset of information is released the S-1 discloses some very important details about the business operations. Over the past several months I’ve analyzed the basket of the roughly 40 public SaaS companies many different ways. With the Box S-1 in hand I can now benchmark Box’s business against other publics and in particular SaaS companies nine years after founding. Box is also nine years old. Below are seven key comparisons between Box and the average public SaaS business. Box is among the fastest growing SaaS companies at this point in its life. Box’s revenue grew 110% in the last twelve months about 2x the average rate of 53% of a SaaS company in its ninth year. The two closest companies in terms of growth rate are LinkedIn and Demandware. In their ninth years LinkedIn grew at 115% and DemandWare grew at 105%. Box’s profitability in year 9 of its life is -136%. No other comparable company comes close in terms of net income % in their ninth year. Second place goes to Rally with -53%. To be fair NetSuite did record an anomalous loss of -158% of revenues in its eighth year before falling to -53% the following year. For context the average public SaaS company generated -14% in net income % at year 9. Box’s burn rate is twice as large as the next comparable firm and nearly 10x the average. To drive its torrid revenue growth in the last 12 months Box burned $168M which is more than twice the next-most-cash-lax company ServiceNow which burned $74M in its ninth year en route to generating $424M in revenue. Both of these massive negative net-income figures are head and shoulders above the average SaaS company which burned $18M to drive $121M in revenue in their ninth years. Box spends about 137% of their revenue on sales and marketing. This sales and marketing expense figure is 3x the average of 42% of revenue found across all other publicly traded SaaS companies at this point in their lifecycle. The next closest comparable is Cornerstone-on-Demand which spent 86% of revenue dollars for sales and marketing. Of the remaining 18 companies in the data set no other firm exceeded 62%. Box spends nearly 3.7x as much on sales and marketing as research and development. The average public SaaS business spends 2.5x at year nine in its life. Although this figure does put Box in the upper end of the spectrum Box isn’t without peers. Salesforce spent 5.3x and CSOD spent 6.2x on sales and marketing vs research and development. Box’s average customer value (ACV) is $3653 much lower than the median of 59600. Only RingCentral a provider of SMB telephone systems has a smaller average customer value. The typical paid account has 51 paying users each paying about $71 per year or $6 per month. This ACV is likely going to increase substantially as 57% of orders last year were placed by companies with more than 1000 seats though it’s unclear how large the typical deployment is within these large companies. Box’s sales average quarterly efficiency over the last year is 0.4 compared to 0.97 for other SaaS publics. This figure implies a pay-back period of 2.5 years for each acquired customer. Unfortunately I couldn’t find churn figures in the S-1 so it’s difficult to make a judgement on long term unit economics. Only LogMeIn had a worse number of 0.27 in its ninth year. All in all Box’s top-line growth is sensational but this engine of growth requires absolutely gargantuan amounts of capital to fuel itself. Additionally this capital need shows no signs of abating. The company’s huge burn rate and massively negative profitability figures indicate a lot of effort must be put into sales to drive incremental revenue growth. Compared to other publicly traded SaaS companies Box is among the least in efficient customer acquisition. But in this market which values revenue growth and seemingly ignores profitability the bottom line doesn’t seem to matter as much as the top line. In that regard Box is close to the top of the heap.

http://tomtunguz.com/customer-pull/,The Indicators of True Strong Customer Demand for a SaaS Product,The Indicators of True Strong Customer Demand for a SaaS Product Customer pull is an amazing feeling for a startup. Because the customer demand is visceral everything seems to move quickly: sales is booking deals quicker than can be on-boarded; product and engineering are rushing to build the features customers request; marketing’s efforts to raise awareness of the business are magnified by word of mouth; and recruiting is doing all they can to fill the looming vacancies. At seed the first signs of strong customer pull are the quality of pilot and trial interest. While the volume varies by price point - freemium companies may have thousands of early customers while $100k+ ACV companies may only have a handful - positive usage patterns indicate strong customer pull. So too does frequent product feedback. In addition vibrant word of mouth proxied by social media mentions/follows Github stars/forks for open source projects and newsletter subscriber counts mark products with substantial latent demand. As a seed stage company grows hires a sales team and deploys the product to more customers the signs of customer pull evolve. Product engagement remains high. The company transitions from pilots with friendly customers to product sales. The sales cycles are fast often less than 30 days: an email one to three conversations sometimes without a demo and straight to a signed contract. As a result of these fast sales cycles sales people exceed their quotas substantially. In some companies I’ve seen sales reps a month in are booking more than $100k in new ARR per month. In a year or so early customers will begin to renew their contracts and these customers increase their spend rewarding the startup with negative net churn. Box New Relic and others have achieved 30% negative net churn/account expansion annually. But in the early stages companies with exceptional customer pull observe greater than 100% annual negative net churn. In addition to serving the core customer base well startups with strong customer pull observe larger companies pulling them up market. Often these Fortune 2000 companies impose security compliance and complex decision-making processes. But in these cases these behemoths relax these constraints because they perceive the product as critical to their success. These signals of customer pull are strong validators for founders to understand when they have achieved a true product market fit and Templeton compression. Not surprisingly these customer pull signals are the same investors use to understand the growth potential of a business. Published 2015-10-02,Published 2015-10-02

http://tomtunguz.com/sales-efficiency-by-acv/,The Optimal Price to Maximize Sales Efficiency for a SaaS Startup,The Optimal Price to Maximize Sales Efficiency for a SaaS Startup Is there an optimal price for a product to maximize a SaaS startup’s sales efficiency? As I’ve been analyzing the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies most recently of HubSpot and Zendesk I’ve been asking myself that question. Do million-dollar enterprise price points and field sales people create more efficient sales organizations than content-marketing-driven SMB startups? Or are the high-velocity inside sales teams of the pursuing the mid-market the most efficient? Using a basket of about 45 publicly traded SaaS companies I analyzed the sales efficiency of these companies by years since founding for different average contract value (ACV) buckets of $15k $50k $120k and $1M. Then I calculated the sales efficiency by year-of-founding in buckets of 2 years from year 2 through year 10. To eliminate bias I whittled the dataset to a subset of the companies who had data in all three periods. The chart above shows the result. On first blush we could conclude $1M ACV companies seem to be more efficient in the company’s early days. We could speculate that this is because an individual salesperson selling million-dollar contracts can be much more efficient than an individual inside sales rep selling $10k products. One million dollar sale is worth the same as one hundred $10k sales. But this initial difference isn’t actually statistically significant. In fact within any of the three periods and across the four different ACV categories the data today shows that there is no optimal ACV that would enable maximum sales efficiency. There is another important conclusions from the data: sales efficiency is monotonically decreasing. The rate of decrease seems to be largest for $1M and $15k ACVs while companies operating within the middle range of ACVs display a slower decline rate. The median SaaS company selling a $1M product declines from a sales efficiency of 1.7 to 0.9 in about 6 years a 47% drop. In contrast the $50k ACV median falls 9%. This could be because the high-velocity inside-sales models can create more repeatable similar-looking sales. Consequently sales efficiency deflates to a lesser extent as the company grows in comparison to field sales team expansion with highly variable quota achievement and content-marketing driven customer acquisition. But I don’t have the data to prove that hypothesis. If you’re looking for more detail on the data I’ve included a box plot above. The box plot that shows the distribution of the data by ACV in greater detail. The line in the middle of the box is the median the outer borders of the box show the 25th and 75% percentile of values and outliers are shown as points. The one challenge of this data analysis is the sample size is relatively small. I hope to refine it over time as more SaaS companies go public and contribute to the data set. The methods used to achieve similar sales efficiencies across these different ACVs varies dramatically but the underlying performance of the median public SaaS company isn’t meaningfully different.

http://tomtunguz.com/behavior-change/,Great SaaS Companies Focus on Behavior Change,Great SaaS Companies Focus on Behavior Change Most SaaS companies provide tools to help people accomplish a goal in a better way than they could before. A key part of a SaaS startup’s toolkit then is changing end user behavior. A startup that doesn’t change the behavior of a customer will see the customer churn in a few months or at the expiration of their contract. Customers don’t change their behavior for many reasons. Sometimes the friction to adopting a new workflow is too great. Other times the value proposition isn’t compelling enough for users. Or the use case is too infrequent for users to remember to change behavior. But to succeed SaaS startups must turn motivation into capability. I’ve seen three ways for SaaS companies to accomplish this goal listed in order of effectiveness: Product: a really great product sells itself. People want to use it because it’s significantly better than whatever preceded it. Product is the strongest and most persistent way of changing behavior. It’s also the most scalable. A great user experience is repeatable with near-zero marginal cost for each user. Dropbox is a great example of how a dramatically better product sells itself and changes user behavior at scale. Looker’s simple tools for data exploration invite entire companies to ask and answer questions of their data. Sales: sales teams can sell the promise of a product and post-sales/customer success teams then reinforce the promise and train customers to operate a product. Sales-based behavior change is obviously much more expensive than product-based behavior change. As a result it’s typically reserved for large enterprise customers and products serving those customers. Customer retention hinges on the company’s ability to sell the value proposition to end users and develop a process to scalably chang their behavior through training and support. Workday and Responsys are two good public SaaS examples of this kind of customer behavior change. Marketing: marketing can sell a dream and appeal to the aspiration of end users to be better at something or be on the cutting edge. Marketing teams can build tremendous interest in a new product category. But marketing can often be challenged in changing behavior unless the team takes on the responsibility of engaging users after a sale. Post-sales lifecycle marketing makes use of product engagement data to trigger tutorials encouragement emails and the like to reinforce product use. Yammer’s email notifications of updates on the network are one example of this kind of behavior. In another example LinkedIn emails users how popular they are to encourage investment in the product. Figuring out the tactics and techniques to convert initial customer enthusiasm and passion for a project into new behaviors is key to long term customer retention and success in SaaS.

http://tomtunguz.com/segmenting-saas-growth/,How Much Should Your Startup Spend to Grow?,How Much Should Your Startup Spend to Grow? Several weeks ago I wrote a post about the Optimal Contract Value for a SaaS company. I wondered whether startups serving enterprises might be more or less valuable than those serving small-to-medium businesses (SMBs). Interestingly the data showed there was no optimal customer value to build a publicly traded SaaS company. Having written that post I began to wonder about other differences between different types of SaaS companies. In particular do SaaS startups serving SMBs spend more or less than their counterparts in the mid-market and enterprise? And which type of SaaS startup grows the fastest? To answer those questions I’ve pulled together data from a basket of 46 publicly traded SaaS/Cloud companies and segmented them based on their average annual customer value (ACV) into three buckets: SMB (<$10k) Midmarket (>=$10k to < $100k) and Enterprise (>$100k). Below I’ve charted the median trends of these companies as they progress from their founding over the next ten years. These four charts contrast sales & marketing investments and revenue growth trends across the three different SaaS startup segments. The chart above depicts the Sales & Marketing (S&M) spend across the three segments. The median SMB SaaS startup spends significantly less on sales and marketing through year 4 of their lives. Presumably these startups are driven to find more cost-effective means of customer acquisition like freemium because the smaller ACVs can’t accommodate larger cost-of-customer acquisition. As the company’s revenue grows however SMB companies’ S&M expenditure converges with Midmarket and Enterprise companies. The mid-market and enterprise companies can afford to hire large sales and marketing teams to acquire customers and spend statistically identical amounts on sales and marketing throughout. The next most important question of course is how those sales & marketing investments translate into revenue growth. The chart above shows that despite the important differences in sales and marketing spend the SMB companies in the dataset (who have been successful enough to IPO) have sustained equivalent revenue growth rates to their sales-team-driven brethren. Presumably these SMBs SaaS startups found a scalable customer acquisition channel that either complemented or wholly replaced the sales and marketing teams in the early days. If you’re curious about the median gross S&M spend by segment the chart above shows that. And the chart below plots the median revenue by segment. These two charts do show one counterintuitive trend: Midmarket SaaS startups tend to generate more revenue than either SMBs or Enterprise. In Segmenting the SaaS Market for Sales Success we showed that the number of employees in very small medium and very large companies is roughly equal. So for a startup pricing per seat the market opportunity is equivalent. But the substantially larger revenues of Midmarket companies shows that these companies are able to penetrate their market more deeply and ultimately capture more revenue. Perhaps these companies strike the best balance between large enough ACVs to justify sales investment and minimize the customization often required of large enterprise software: this powerful combination minimizes sales costs while accelerating sales velocity. Or so the data suggests. It’s important to note that the dataset I’ve used is quite small and the number of data points on any given year for a given segment number no more than 10. This means that for most of the comparisons there is no statistically significant difference between the data of SMB Midmarket and Enterprise companies’ sales & marketing investments or revenue growth which is itself an interesting conclusion. There is only one exception to this: the S&M expenditure of SMB SaaS companies is significantly lower in their early years than in other segments. Also these benchmarks are medians and they mask the variance across companies. Each of these companies pursued unique approaches in the market that enabled them to become leaders in their field and the aggregate statistics will never be able to communicate those unique stories.

Kenny is renowned for pioneering the flywheel sales model that propelled Solarwinds to a $150M company profitably. Unlike traditional sales models the flywheel sales model requires sales people to close business only from existing users. No outbound prospecting allowed. This requirement unifies the go-to-market efforts of companies and spins a customer acquisition flywheel faster and faster to achieve terrifically efficient growth. Flywheel business models are still rare and not well understood but when executed well they create lasting defensible and hugely valuable businesses. If you’re interested to know more about how to build these bottoms-up businesses please register at the SaaS Office Hours page. And a quick note about SaaS Office Hours. Due to overwhelming demand for our session with Bill Macaitis CMO of Slack we’re transitioning the sign ups into a wait list. About a week before the event we’ll send emails to roughly 30-40 people confirming their spots. Our goal is to create an intimate environment for founders and executives to network and learn from the SaaS world’s leading experts in different fields. We’ll continue to experiment with the program over time. If you have feedback suggestions or ideas please email me using the link on the top right of this page.

http://tomtunguz.com/agendaless-observer/,The Power of an Unbiased Agenda-less Observer,The Power of an Unbiased Agenda-less Observer When the meeting first appeared on my calendar I incredulous at the idea of a management coach. “A business shrink who would sap another hour from my frenetic day” I thought. I was a few months into being a product manager at Google and stressed because I was in over my head. Most difficult of all I lacked any type of formal authority. Google structured its product teams to have authority through influence not direct management of engineering teams or marketing teams or sales teams. The brilliance of the engineers marketers and salespeople I worked with amplified this challenge. We were all holding each other to very high standards. I walked into my first meeting with my management coach frazzled with the demands of the PM job and frustrated to be allocating an hour to the meeting. Unprepared without an agenda I introduced myself and sat down not without an air of arrogance. Within the first five minutes the coach had completely disarmed me. Her tool of choice: the open-ended question. How are you? Where do you want to be in a few years? What are you struggling with at work? How do you want to improve? With that series of questions and knowing that she had no agenda other than to help me and listen to me she had made an ally of me and over time I became a more effective and happier PM. During those sessions I began to understand the impact of an unbiased agenda-less observer - in other words a coach. It was easy for me to be open with her and share my worries about my shortcomings as a product manager. There were no negative consequences of admitting them because everything we shared was held in confidence. My coach brought fresh eyes to problems asked basic questions and pulled apart the challenges I brought to her each week. Because she wasn’t familiar with the inner-workings of the company the people the interpersonal dynamics or the technology I was forced to explain the situation an exercise which often helped me put to words how I was feeling or dealing with the situation. These summaries also revealed the solutions: simplify simplify. When presented with one of my problems she would equip me with simple frameworks for structuring important presentations to the executive team (clear - describe the slide content - deliver the content transition - set up the next slide) sharing difficult feedback to co-workers and techniques for effective delegation. I use many of them today. It’s been seven years since my first meeting with my management coach and I still see her and consult her with my challenges from time-to-time. A fresh perspective from a skilled unbiased friend/coach can be refreshing and insightful. It’s an investment well worth making even for the most time-constrained people.

http://tomtunguz.com/how-freemium-works/,Three Counterintuitive Points about SMB SaaS,Three Counterintuitive Points about SMB SaaS Kenny van Zant drew this diagram for me on white board and I think it’s the best visualization of how SMB SaaS freemium business grow. The diagram highlights a few important mechanics of the SMB SaaS business model. In any given freemium user base small-office/home-office (1 to 20 employee shops) users tend to be a few times larger in size than true SMB customer (20 to 500 employees). Most of these SOHO customers remain unpaid evangelists. A few of these customers grow into SMBs and become paying customers - they cross the dashed line in this diagram. But most paying users for freemium services are SMBs. While these mechanics may be well known there are three counterintuitive things about the SMB SaaS model. Counterintuitive Point #1: The SMB Market Opportunity is 2x Larger than the SOHO Opportunity Below is a bar chart showing the number of employees working in businesses by size of employees using data from the US Census. While there are nearly 5M SOHOs in the US and only about 1M SMBs there are twice as many employees in the SMB segment than in the SOHO segment 38M in SMB and 21M in SOHO. For any business charging on a per seat model this means the SMB market is about twice as large as the SOHO market. Counterintuitive Point #2: SOHO Customers are Just As Important as SMBs Despite the typically lower conversion rates and smaller business opportunity of SOHOs SOHOs are critical in SMB SaaS success. They are the word-of-mouth marketing force that blogs and tweets and drives mobile app store volume to boost chart rankings and tells their friends about this great free product they are using to solve their problem. Counterintuitive Point #3: Freemium Businesses Reverse the Hunter and Farmer Sales Roles In traditional software businesses the enterprise sales team hunts. They acquire leads cold call and push customers to convert. Their counterparts the inside sales team nurture and cultivate these relationships to prevent churn and grow revenue through up-sell. Freemium businesses reverse the roles. The inside sales team fields the freemium leads from free user base make the cold calls and push the customers to convert. The enterprise sales team looks for multiple teams within the same company paying separately builds a relationship and grows revenue through up-sell helping their customers grow. A Different Animal While SMB SaaS business may seem like traditional software businesses scaled down they aren’t. The SMB and SOHO markets require a wholly new marketing approach that may seem counterintuitive at first but when implemented well can build very large businesses.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-business/,The tension between predictability and creativity,The tension between predictability and creativity In every one of my conversations with Peter Lehrman founder of AxialMarket he always speaks about AxialMarket as “the business.” Never the company the startup or any other word. At first blush I thought it was a trivial semantic difference a New York-ism but over time I’ve come to realize this word choice marks a significant difference that manifests itself in culture product and go to market. Calling any company a business connotes a formality the word startup doesn’t share. A business is serious. A business is a stand-alone self sustaining entity. A business evokes thoughts of goals revenue profitability execution and a performance mentality. On the other hand the word startup feels exploratory and casual and evokes images of tshirts jeans hacking electric scooters experimentation - a culture and brand image startups have actively cultivated. It’s not to say many startups aren’t performance-driven organizations using management techniques like scrums and Trello cards but startup culture doesn’t overtly celebrate blocking and tackling as success. Nor am I saying businesses don’t embrace the practices that startup culture uses to build innovation engines. They do. Startups and businesses learn from each other. In fact startups often evolve into businesses. A startup may start as a product and sometimes remain a product forever eg Instagram Blogger Flickr. Sometimes startups become businesses eg YouTube Twitter Facebook. Sometimes businesses are just born that way eg Yammer ZenDesk LinkedIn Square AxialMarket. When a startup evolves into a business it introduces systems to create predictability. Why? Predictability is valuable. It helps with hiring capital raising morale product planning marketing and s oon. The best businesses are often called machines because they embody this characteristic. Apple is a consumer products machine. They predictably create insanely great devices. Google is a revenue growth machine - 30% y/y growth every year since they have been a public company - predictably. I think every startup company and business must maintain tension between creative chaos and a drive toward predictive performance. That’s how they grow and innovate and win. There are many paths to achieving success. Some founders choose to begin as a startup. Others like Peter choose to begin as a business. But despite the starting point each type of company blends skills from the other to succeed. Published 2012-08-30,Published 2012-08-30

http://tomtunguz.com/mobile-saas/,The Challenge Facing Mobile-First SaaS Companies,The Challenge Facing Mobile-First SaaS Companies For consumer products the power of mobile distribution is hard to overstate. Facebook serves more than 1B mobile users each month. Angry Birds reached 50M users in 35 days a feat that took Instagram 18 months and Facebook more than 3 years. But the distribution advantages of mobile app stores hasn’t been observed as powerfully in SaaS or enterprise software for driving revenue. The majority of the top 20 slots of the Business Apps Category in the iTunes store aren’t occupied by startups. Nor has the story of a 3 year-to-10M user story been written about an enterprise application yet. The difference between consumer and the SaaS startups’ effectiveness leveraging mobile app store distribution hinges on the end user. In the case of consumer companies the end user is the buyer. In SaaS the end user is very infrequently the buyer. This is why mobile SaaS companies must employ a two-step value proposition first convincing the end user to download and use the app and second using this data to initiate a sales process with the decision-maker within the enterprise. This second step at least to date has been the limiting factor in using mobile-app distribution to drive SaaS company growth. However SaaS mobile usage patterns are certainly following the lead of their consumer counterparts. It’s not uncommon for many SaaS startups with mobile apps to see 30-50%+ of their usage on mobile a figure now common in ecommerce and other consumer categories. There’s no question that mobile has impacted SaaS companies’ businesses. At the very least SaaS companies must build a mobile application to maximize engagement with their userbase. Perhaps in the near future an innovative startup will find a way to target both the end user and the enterprise decision maker through the mobile store. Until then mobile app stores will remain great end-user acquisition channels but won’t replace the inside-sales process to close customers. Published 2014-08-05,Published 2014-08-05
http://tomtunguz.com/free-agents/,How to Retain Your Startup's Best Employees,How to Retain Your Startup's Best Employees One of the most important changes is the workplace in the last 20 years is the notion that most employees are free agents. We are hired and fired and resign at will. It’s a markedly different era than the career salarymen of IBM’s heyday who remained with the company for decades from college graduation through retirement. In this highly-competitive talent market where every employee is a free agent hiring and retaining talent has become a key strategic advantage. So which are the best tools to create a vibrant and attractive working environment? I’m sure this is a question on every founder and CEO’s mind. In The Alliance Reid Hoffman Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh describe the talent management strategies which succeeded at LinkedIn. In particular they adopt a metaphor coined by VP of Product David Hahn during his nine years at LinkedIn: the Tour of Duty. A Tour of Duty has a defined mission clear objectives and a bounded time frame. The book describes three different types of Tours of Duty: Rotational Tours: rotational tours cycle an employee through a few different departments over the course of several years. The employee benefits from a breadth of learning and exposure to different teams and the employer tests longer-term fit across different departments. Several companies have management rotation programs. Some of the best known ones including GE’s Early Career Leadership Program and Google’s APM program among many others. Transformational Tours: transformational tours are bounded by individual progression and are typically negotiated by manager and employee with the aim of transforming the employee into someone who can meaningfully change the trajectory of the business. They are often longer in duration than rotational tours. Foundational Tours: a smaller group of people will be able to embark on foundational tours which the book defines as exceptional alignment of employee and employer. Jony Ive at Apple. Jeff Weiner at LinkedIn. Eric Schmidt at Google. These there employees joined a company and transformed it by melding their vision with the company’s. Foundational tours can last decades. Achieving success in a of Tours of Duty demands a similar process to most well designed projects. First a shared sense of mission and values between employer and employee must be established. Second the company must take the time to understand the short and long term career aspirations of the employee and craft a tour of duty with relevant daily work that will help the employee achieve those goals. Third employers and employees must define success criteria for the Tour of Duty. Fourth employer and manager should provide each other feedback on progress throughout. Finally the next tour of duty must begin to be defined before the current one is completed. I wasn’t familiar with it before reading The Alliance but I really like the idea of a Tour of Duty. It aligns the mission and work of an employee with a business and ensures both are benefitting from the relationship. In order to attract and retain the best talent startups have to create a culture of trust respect learning accomplishment and shared values/mission. The Tour of Duty concept is a framework to help companies foster that culture. Published 2014-07-29,Published 2014-07-29
http://tomtunguz.com/five-key-people-in-sales-processes/,The 5 Key People in a SaaS Sales Process,The 5 Key People in a SaaS Sales Process Whether implicitly or explicitly it’s critical for a startup to map out accounts to understand the purchasing dynamics of a buyer. When sales teams start selling their goal should be to create the sales playbook. The playbook all begins with understanding the key dynamics among the five players in the sales process. These are the five people: The Proponent of the Sale champions the sales. The Salesperson must equip this champion with all the tools to convince the other stakeholders to pursue the transaction. The Opponent of the Sale objects to the transaction. Opponents of the Sale exist in almost every software sale. Many different reasons fuel opposition to a sale. A head of engineering may prefer to build a technology in house. A head of finance may disagree with the financial benefits. A team lead may suffer decreased staff decline in power or reduced importance reduced as a consequence of new software. The Decisionmaker is the ultimate person who must be convinced to invest the dollars to buy the software. The Decisionmaker may often have different perspectives than the Proponent of the Sale. Often the Decisionmarker is the CEO or CFO. The other stakeholders vary by product price and sales process. They can be other people and teams who are impacted by a new product: IT may have to integrate new systems. Marketing and Sales may have to change their internal processes when deploying a new CRM. The last person is the Salesperson who as depicted above must build as strong a relationship with all the key holders. Understanding the relationships in the sales process is key to creating a playbook. Scaling a SaaS sales process starts with mapping out the relationships with the key stakeholders.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-new-sales-hotness-the-product-qualified-lead-pql/,The product qualified lead (PQL),The product qualified lead (PQL) Many of the SaaS companies I work with are buzzing about a new concept: product qualified leads (PQL). It’s typical to see outbound sales teams create new leads by cold-calling - think Glengarry. And marketing also qualifies leads (MQL) using online advertising branding content email and other channels. But the PQL concept is novel. PQLs are potential customers who have used a product and reached pre-defined triggers that signify a strong likelihood to become a paying customer. A hypothetical example at Expensify might be if a user uploads 10 receipts and invites one friend this user is a PQL and should be sent to the sales team. Each product will have a different definition of a PQL because each product measures engagement differently. Also the definition will change with time as product usage patterns evolve. The best definitions of PQL are informed by conversion correlation data eg the behaviors trigger customers to convert paid. PQLs are powerful because they are “free” scalable and highly qualified. If a product sells itself the business wins free customer. (I’m ignoring software development costs and opportunity costs to develop features that may not impact PQL and sales performance directly.) They are scalable because they require no human touch and they are high-quality leads. When the sales team calls PQLs customers typically convert at about 25 to 30%. Also PQLs are a fantastic management tool because they align the entire company around one goal: revenue. Typically the product and engineering teams don’t have goals tied to revenue which bisects a team into revenue generating components (sales and marketing) and cost centers (eng and product). Aside from potentially creating cultural challenges this structure is less effective than it could be. PQLs pull product and engineering into the fray. Everyone in the company has the same goal. For product and eng teams PQLs provide a rigorous framework for prioritizing development. Each feature can be benchmarked to determine the net impact to PQL which is ultimately funnel optimization. Of course a myopic focus on PQL isn’t ideal either. The product and eng teams must balance their revenue goals with new feature development engagement cultivation infrastructure upkeep and so on. But product managers should be able to strike a reasonable equilibrium. PQLs provide tremendous leverage for startups by aligning the goals of the product and engineering teams with the rest of the company. Consider implementing them as a management tool in your 2013 plans. Published 2013-01-15,Published 2013-01-15
http://tomtunguz.com/how-to-interview-culture/,A Framework to Maximize Your Startup's Hiring Success,A Framework to Maximize Your Startup's Hiring Success After a startup attains product market fit and begins to exceed the first breaking point of the startup management structure around 10 employees it’s time to codify the company’s values. The values of the company are the most concrete way for a business to determine whether candidates might make good employees. At two separate SaaS Office Hours recently we heard similar stories from Maia at Greenhouse and Pete at Optimizely. At both Optimizely and Greenhouse one member of the management team began the values definition process as the company began to scale. First the lead solicited feedback from current employees about what they liked and didn’t like about working at their startup either by interviews or surveys. Then the lead condensed these into an initial set of values reviewed by the management team. Next the management team presented them to the employees and began an iteration and refinement process until everyone was satisfied that the values written down truly reflected the way employees felt about the company. Last the values began an integral component of the interview process for new people. At Google we called these values Googliness. Other companies employ witty acronyms and other mnemonics but all of them consider the cultural fit a critical element in hiring people. These values determine where in the Performance/Culture 2x2 matrix depicted above. As Maia told us companies should only hire candidates that fit in the upper right quadrant that are both high performers and strong cultural fits. And hiring managers often hire the wrong person when they compromise on either one of these attributes as tempting as it may be in this competitive talent market. Behavioral interview questions test values best. If your startup prizes customer-centricity ask candidates “Tell me about a time when you went out of your way to help a customer?” And after they’ve responded follow up with “Now tell me about a second time.” Candidates who truly do embody customer-centricity shouldn’t be challenged by these questions and the cultural fit will become clear. This type of structured interview should test for the values the company has enumerated together and will ensure a more consistent hiring success rate and better candidate fit.

High growth companies peaked in February last year at about 22x forward revenues and have fallen to 11x on March 1 2015. Established companies dropped similarly from 6.6x to 4.5x. The chart above shows the same figures per company. Drops are common across the board. The only companies with increases in multiples are Constant Contact (CTCT) BazaarVoice (BV) Qualys (QLYS) and ProofPoint (PFPT) none of which are High Growth companies by this analysis’ definition. (The Box chart is empty because they’ve only just gone public.) One on hand it’s never appealing for a company’s multiple to decrease. But on the other hand this relative cooling of the shows that at least in the public market investors aren’t falling over themselves to invest no matter the financials of a business. In other words there’s no public market SaaS price bubble. This slight deflation is a healthy trend. While the public market seem to be lowering multiples the private markets seem to be holding or increasing them as investors compete for the opportunity to invest in explosive-growth SaaS companies. The size and prices of Series B rounds have soared in 2014 and with it the forward multiples in contrast to the public markets. It’s very unlikely that the private markets multiples will push the public ones upward and much more likely that over time the public market will dictate the way SaaS companies are valued. Later stage investors will model their returns of a new investment based on the public market comparables. Eventually because fund raising markets are like a train this pressure should cascade to the earlier rounds. In short lower multiples for publicly traded companies will exert downward pressure on the private markets. Or at least they should be. But from what I’ve seen so far in 2015 this isn’t the case. There’s as much enthusiasm and confidence in SaaS companies as there ever has been. There’s $50B of new cash to invest in venture stage companies. The combination of the two creates a tension between the public market and the private market multiples. Published 2015-03-18,Published 2015-03-18
http://tomtunguz.com/apis/,Your Startup’s API Could be Its Disruptor,Your Startup’s API Could be Its Disruptor How deeply do you consider the impacts of building a public API for your startup? It’s no small decision: you could be enabling your disruptor. APIs are incredibly powerful tools for enabling partners building ecosystems and engendering success among customers. For example Salesforce’s Force ecosystem which enables developers to build products atop customer Salesforce installations and increases the value customers derive from Salesforce selling more seats and retaining customers longer. Google’s Maps API enables developers to spread Google Maps building the brand increasing distribution and all the while improving ranking by sending back user feedback signals. But for many startups in particular proprietary data and network based businesses APIs create one of the most effective ways to sap competitive advantage enabling viable competitors to emerge. Twitter released their API broadly to developers who built competing front-ends and was forced to revoke access lest developers disintermediate Twitter’s relationship with its users. Facebook’s API term evolve constantly in response to perceived threats like Path and MessageMe. LinkedIn’s API is much more restrictive to prevent conflicts of interest from arising. In each of these five cases the API provider has to consider the API’s balance of data trade: the net input of data vs net output: how much data value are you giving away compared to what you receive in return. In Twitter’s case Twitter provided developers a content stream that would grow developer user bases for clients. But in the end Twitter developers couldn’t provide enough value back to Twitter to build a case for the API. Similarly Facebook revokes access to developers with whom they perceive a negative balance of data. Facebook’s social graph is it’s most valuable asset - ceding it to others via API would be disastrous. But weaving themselves into the fabric of the web through oAuth and identity increases the net data into Facebook while allying partners across the Internet with Facebook. LinkedIn’s restrictive API is essential because they are a data business. They sell data to interested recruiters. Too lax of an API might enable wily recruiters to skirt payment requirements and ultimately copy the relevant data for themselves. APIs are great strategic tools. They can reinforce and grow businesses partner ecosystems and customer value. But improperly deployed APIs can also undermine the business you’re building. Ensure your balance of data trade is always overwhelmingly positive before releasing your API. h/t to David Hammer for helping me think through this post Published 2013-05-14,Published 2013-05-14
http://tomtunguz.com/hubspot-ipo/,Benchmarking Hubspot's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking Hubspot's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up One of the best ways I’ve found to understand SaaS companies is to pore through their public filings. A few months ago I analyzed Box’s S-1. In this post we’ll look at HubSpot’s IPO filing and compare their journey to a public company with a basket of about 40 other publicly traded companies in the hopes that this data will help other founders chart their path to IPO. In the next seven charts we’ll explore how HubSpot built their business. We will explore revenue growth average revenue per customer sales efficiency payback periods net income gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots I’ve used HubSpot’s colors as a consistent legend. HubSpot company data is orange median values are black and other company values are gray. HubSpot has achieved amazing revenue growth in their first 7 years as a company growing by more than 12x from $5.7M in 2009 revenue to 2013 revenue of $71M - an 88% CAGR. HubSpot’s revenue trajectory is effectively identical to the median publicly traded SaaS company. HubSpot’s average revenue per customer (ARPC) of about $7752 is the fourth smallest of the companies I analyzed. HubSpot’s target customer base are SMBs and with this price point it’s possible to support a profitable inside sales model if the team is very efficient. Only WIX CTCT and RNG had smaller figures of $86 $265 and $352. FLTX a maker of fleet tracking software has identical ARPC. I’ve plotted a subset of them in the chart above. Company Founded Years to IPO Rev in $M at IPO RNG 1999 14 162 QLYS 1999 13 91 DATA 2003 10 232 FLTX 2004 10 128 CTCT 2007 9 31 HUBS 2006 8 113* WIX 2006 7 81 * estimated from the first six months of the S-1 HubSpot is the second fastest SMB SaaS company to IPO yet achieving the mark within 8 years. Most other SMB companies defined for this analysis as having an ARPC of less than $15000 took at least one more year to go public. Only WIX became a public company faster achieving the mark in 7 years. Impressively HubSpot has been able to record much faster revenue growth than other SMB SaaS companies. I've estimated $113M in revenue for 2014 by extrapolating their first six months of revenue this year and applying the 2013 growth rate to it. For comparison DATA recorded $62M in its eighth full year of business compared to $100M+ for HubSpot. To grow at that pace HubSpot has been investing aggressively in sales and the company is widely respected for its content marketing prowess. HubSpot's sales efficiency defined as the incremental annual gross margin divided by the sales marketing and general expenses incurred in the previous year is somewhat lower than the median SaaS company. In 2013 the company recorded a sales efficiency of 0.47 meaning about $2 of sales and marketing spend is required to generate $1 in gross profit and the payback period the number of years before a customer's revenue offsets the cost of customer acquisition is just over 2 years. Field 2011 2012 2013 ARPC 5395 6580 7752 CAC 6671 8279 11645 $ Retention Rate 71.6% 82.4% 82.9% Sales Efficiency 0.47 0.54 0.42 Payback Period (yrs) 2.2 1.9 2.4 Above I’ve copied the unit economics data from the S-1. HubSpot has been either pursuing larger customers or has become more effective at generating more revenue from the same customer base by cross or up-selling. Average revenue per customer has increased by about 44% in the past two years. But that incremental revenue costs about 75% more in customer acquisition costs over the same period. The net effect is that HubSpot customers must pay for about 2.4 years before they become profitable on a unit basis. Given the current revenue churn rates about 70% of customers on a dollar basis will be break-even or profitable so the unit economics work. In the short term the increasing costs of customer acquisition decrease net income. HubSpot must pay more to acquire a customers and as a consequence the company’s net income in dollar terms is below that of the public SaaS median meaning the company is burning more cash than the typical public SaaS company. But because HubSpot generates more revenue than the typical public SaaS company in its eight year it can afford to spend more total dollars on customer acquisition than other companies at a similar stage. On a relative basis however HubSpot is closer to the median up until 2012. In 2013 with the big bump in CAC HubSpot’s net income as a percentage of revenue fell. However only 5 companies had more negative net-income-to-revenue ratios: NetSuite Jive Medidata Box and Marketo. For the moment HubSpot is among the least profitable companies in the set but I suspect this is because the company is investing in growth. HubSpot’s gross margin percent is rapidly improving and tracking the median. This means that HubSpot’s cost of revenue which for SaaS companies includes hosting costs and customer support/success expenses is right in line with comparable companies. Last HubSpot has historically invested more in engineering (R&D) than most SaaS companies investing more than 50% of revenues just a few years ago but as the business has grown HubSpot’s investment as a percentage of revenue has approached the median or about 20% of revenue. HubSpot has always been a leader in SMB customer acquisition in particular because of their tremendous ability to acquire customers through content marketing. The HubSpot team has been able to build an explosive business one of the fastest growing SMB SaaS companies in history with this model. The HubSpot journey to a public company provides a terrific set of benchmarks for other SMB SaaS companies. I’m excited to see how the company’s story continues to evolve.

http://tomtunguz.com/no-startup-is-an-island-develop-your-ecosystem/,No startup is an island: the three ecosystems startups should develop,No startup is an island: the three ecosystems startups should develop It’s tempting to burrow within a garage or basement or apartment to develop a product for several months and emerge from the darkness with a new shiny product. But the launch will likely fall flat. Products must be launched into ecosystems in particular into receptive ecosystems. In my view there are three types of ecosystems that startups should cultivate. These ecosystems provide distribution leverage - that’s what makes them so powerful and so essential at the start of a company. 1. Customer/User Community Users provide product feedback build word of mouth distribution write reviews become reference customers and form the basis of online support communities. Often these communities are worth their weight in gold. 2. Platforms The most platforms are app stores (iOS Android and Facebook) which provide access to hundreds of millions of users. But relationship with these platforms don’t start and stop at the developer terms of service. The most effective startups build relationships with the managers of these platforms to understand how to align goals of the startup and the platform. 3. The Press The press is a great way of focusing attention on a startup for a short period of time. Building an ongoing relationship with the press provides a startup with a megaphone at key times during the company’s life to trumpet success drive awareness and build the brand. Launching a product with the support of these ecosystems can provide orders of magnitude better leverage. Building these relationships isn’t easy but the investment can pay off in spades. Examples from the Redpoint portfolio: User Ecosystem ThredUp’s Facebook page where thousands of moms congregate Expensify’s iTunes page with hundreds of customers reviews ZenDesk’s reference customer page Platforms Heroku’s add on Store StorSimple’s distribution through Microsoft Published 2012-10-22,Published 2012-10-22
http://tomtunguz.com/the-five-barriers-to-disrupting-a-market/,Startup playbook: reverse-engineering Clay Christens’s market disruptions,Startup playbook: reverse-engineering Clay Christens’s market disruptions In this month’s HBR Clay Christensen and Maxwell Wessell published an article targeted to the CEOs of large companies on how to prevent disruption to their businesses. They point to five major barriers to competition in a market listed in increasing order of difficulty to assail. Instead of reviewing the incumbent’s strategy I’m going to flip these around to reverse engineer these defenses and build a startup’s playbook for disruption with examples from our portfolio. The inertia barrier: When entering a market a startup has to convince a customer the value of switching is greater than the switching costs including building a new relationship implementing a new provider and training. The tech-implementation barrier: Startups should leverage their nimbleness and focus to bring a better product to market faster. Ex. Expensify is building a mobile-first expense reporting solution with great OCR and a better customer experience. By iterating quickly and responding to customer needs Expensify is outpacing its competition and winning market share. The ecosystem barrier: Products don’t exist in a vacuum. Startups need to build and master their go-to-market strategy. This means building core competencies in sales and marketing in addition to striking the right partnerships. Ex. Electric Imp must build an ecosystem of vendors to succeed. Without OEMs integrating our technology the company cannot get their product to market. The new technologies barrier: Sometimes startups have to develop new technologies to enter a market. This is particularly true when incumbents are already competing with each other with commodity goods and use price as a differentiator. Ex. Pure Storage has built software to enable cheaper but more failure-prone consumer flash drives to achieve the quality of service enterprises demand. The business model barrier: By radically altering the cost of sales or cost to serve a customer startups can decimate incumbents. Ex. Netflix’s DVD distribution business didn’t require the massive capex and real estate investment of Blockbuster. ThredUp is challenging brick-and-mortar consignment in the same way. The linchpin of every business is deeply understanding customer needs and building a product that solves problems. Combining a passion for the right design with a play from the playbook above is key to disrupting a market. Published 2012-12-03,Published 2012-12-03
http://tomtunguz.com/how-competition-strengthens-startups/,How Competition Strengthens Startups,How Competition Strengthens Startups In HBR this month two British researchers reported on their study of the impact of competition on startups. In a study of over 2M companies spanning 10 years the researchers determined that if a startup faced competition in its first year it was more likely to fail. But if the startup survived its first year it’s survival rate jumped nearly 30%. This data screams survivorship bias. Of course the startups who navigate hostile waters deftly in their first year will have a higher likelihood of success. These startups' management teams have already proven they can develop marketing and sales competencies while bringing a product to market. The takeaway from this study shouldn’t be any new insight about whether a startups should enter markets with our without competitors. There is no question startups should choose markets or market segments without competitors. Less competition implies more time to figure things out and ultimately better margins. Instead the data shows the importance of focus on a differentiated and defensible value proposition in the face of competition and the importance of building a team who can manage a company in the face of great odds. Without either startups fail faster. Whether tested early in their development or much later great teams building differentiated products win. Published 2013-02-19,Published 2013-02-19
http://tomtunguz.com/statements-of-work/,Using Statements of Work to Accelerate Sales Cycle and Align Sales Customer Success and Marketing,Using Statements of Work to Accelerate Sales Cycle and Align Sales Customer Success and Marketing I met a really smart vice president of sales a few weeks ago working in a company with mid-market customer values in the $10-100k per year range. When I asked her about her sales process she described how her team employs statements of work (SOW) which isn’t something I hear about very frequently in startups despite the fact they are very powerful sales tools. Statements of work describe the proposed working relationship between a vendor and customer. These are common in government contracts and in the advertising agency world where they are called creative briefs among other places. But I don’t run across them very often in SaaS. In this company’s case the sales team uses statements of work during the middle part of the sales process (after qualification before contract) to accomplish three goals. First to clarify the needs of the customer and set the customer’s expectations of what the product could and couldn’t deliver. Second to further qualify a customer and establish commitment. Third to equip the project champion the tools with which to close the internal sale with the ultimate decision-maker. Each of these three points is important but for me the third one is the most important. Equipping the internal champion with the right tools to make an internal sales successful is just as important as any other part of the sales process and particularly in the cases complex sales education sales or expensive sales. There are many ways to construct a statement of work and they are often industry dependent. But they often contain the following key parameters: A description of the current situation An overview of the challenges and problems the company faces Identifying the key members within the company will make this project successful A list of the key objectives of the partnership A collection of the constraints on the project including budget deadline manpower other vendors etc. Definitions of success ideally quantitative ones (super-important!) A discussion of alternatives to the partnership and why they aren’t the right way forward A few brief case studies or examples of similar customers who have been successful in the past The statement of work converts the company’s phone or in-person sales pitch into an asset for the internal champion. Additionally statements of work establish project success criteria which enable post-sales/customer success teams to exceed customers expectations routinely and repeatably. For this reason SOWs can be a vital document in the handoff between sales and customer success and can also form the basis for better collaboration between the two teams.In addition marketing also gets involved in order to contribute to product positioning and case studies. So statements or can align three teams. These documents don’t have to be very lengthy or involved. They are often templated and reused from customer to customer particularly in pitching customers across the same verticals. But they can be very effective in accelerating sales cycles and aligning the go-to-market teams of your startup. Published 2014-10-24,Published 2014-10-24
http://tomtunguz.com/vpe-vpp-compensation-trends/,The Surprising Compensation Trends of Startup Executives,The Surprising Compensation Trends of Startup Executives Since 2008 there has been a secular trend to increase cash compensation and decrease equity to startup management teams. Tho two tables below tell the story for VPs of Engineering (VPE) and VPs of Product (VPP) across the US broadly and in the SF Bay Area. VPE US SF Cash +10% +16% Equity -19% -17% VPP US SF Cash +26% +8% Equity -31% -25% In the past 5 years VPEs have benefitted from a 10 to 16% increase in their cash compensation but have seen their equity grants fall by 17-19%. The same pattern holds true for VPPs: an 8-26% increas in cash and a 25-30% drop in equity grants. Above I’ve charted the cash compensation trends (salary+bonus) for the different roles and different locations. The Bay Area (marked as SF) is in red; the US is in blue. Below is the same chart for equity. I’m using a data set that polls the compensation of several hundred venture backed companies in this analysis. I’ve chosen to use non-founder data in other words executives who have been hired into startups because that market has more liquidity and should reflect true market prices better. Why is this happening? The recent larger investments in startups could make them more cash rich and therefore more generous with cash than equity. Increases in cost of living in different regions might compel new hires to ask for a greater cash/equity split to offset inflation in living costs. Or there might be some bias in the data set towards later stage companies whose success more assured. To determine the real cause requires more analysis. Nevertheless startups across the US and across different management positions have meaningfully changed their compensation structures to favor cash over equity in the past five years.

http://tomtunguz.com/saas-and-content/,What SaaS Businesses Can Learn from the News Industry,What SaaS Businesses Can Learn from the News Industry If asked to describe the characteristics of a successful freemium business I might highlight three things: effective community marketing command of new distribution platforms and a paid product users love that is priced by usage. Look no further than ZenDesk Evernote Expensify Dropbox. Each of them has built a vibrant user base using freemium products. But what if instead of pointing to SaaS companies as the vanguards of this movement I lauded The Atlantic The New York Times and the Financial Times? In fact SaaS companies can learn quite a lot from the marketing efforts of content companies. In both cases a great product alone is not sufficient to maximize growth. Marketing plays an essential role. Publishing houses invented the subscription model and have honed the marketing tactics to support it. The first subscription business developed in the 1700s as a way to hedge the risks of a single fickle patron underwriting book publishing costs. The most important works of the era including the first illustrated edition of Milton’s Paradise Lost were financed this way. In the 300 years since its invention the content subscription model hasn’t changed but the marketing tactics have been refined. The three major marketing tactics employed by these companies are: Daily community marketing: The Atlantic’s blogs provide daily high quality content for consistent engagement between published issues. These blogs cement the brand and voice in users' daily lives while reinforcing the value of the journalism in the magazine. In addition to staff blogs several publications have adopted the contributor model the newest wave of community marketing. The WSJ Accelerators Program co-opts key members of a community who write on particular topics and bring their own audiences to the WSJ. Similarly the effectiveness of Mint or OKCupid or GitHub’s blog can’t be overstated as a method for engaging the community every day. ZenDesk’s blog highlights challenges their customers face and suggests solutions allying the company with their user base. Leveraging new distribution channels: Publishing great daily content isn’t enough. Customers and potential customers need to read it. BuzzFeed is the canonical example of content reverse-engineered to succeed on social networks. The power of social networks for content syndication is enormous. Ride the wave. Freemium business rely on large vocal passionate user bases. Catalyzing these groups to get together (whether online or offline) discuss key issues problems and solutions as a community is essential for growth. Mobile is an equally important channel. For the Financial Times more than half of revenue is digital thanks to mobile app store distribution. Marco Arment’s the Magazine is the second highest grossing iPhone news app - generating more revenue than the WSJ the Economist and the New Yorker. That’s the power of new distribution channels. Similarly the lion’s share of Expensify’s users come across the application through mobile app stores. Because these users are free no one can compete with Expensify’s cost of customer acquisition creating a big moat for competitors. Free content creates a marketing base: All that great content published by news organizations invites users to learn more about the publication participate in conversations download mobile apps share content and so on generating data. This data is fuel for marketing to build customer sales campaigns to drive content subscriptions eg the FT’s dynamic paywall which decides how many free articles to permit a user based on that user’s propensity to pay. Freemium SaaS companies are no different. The goals of the freemium product are to create prioritized leads for a marketing or sales team to close with much greater efficiency than an uninformed outbound calling campaign. The tactics of content marketing companies apply equally well to freemium SaaS businesses who can leverage content community and data to great success. Published 2013-02-20,Published 2013-02-20
http://tomtunguz.com/ooda/,Military Strategy Applied to Startups,Military Strategy Applied to Startups OODA was a technique coined by John Boyd one of the leading military thinkers of the last 100 years based on the German’s Blitzkrieg-style warfare which prioritized speed and surprise over the traditional win hold and grind attrition techniques of trench warfare. After @pmarca tweeted about the concept I read one of the books on the topic called Certain to Win. Boyd’s thesis is that leaders of successful teams have to enable their organization to move rapidly which means empowering people at all levels to make decisions. Speed is a huge asset in confrontations in both business and war particularly when there is a substantial size difference between two competitors so the author writes. According to Boyd’s philosophy the way to enable teams to become agile is by using two frameworks each with four ideas the Organizational Climate and OODA. For teams to act swiftly Boyd reasons they must share four cultural values. First the team must have a shared mission. Second the team must be singularly focused on a goal. Third they must trust each other. This confidence is most often developed through shared experiences/hardship. Fourth the team must have an intuition for the problem space which more frequently than not comes from training but sometimes raw talent. Intuition is critical for fast decisions. It’s easy to see these values embodied in a Navy Seals team but a little harder to picture for a consumer marketing team or an enterprise sales team. The second framework is OODA. OODA is an acronym for Observe Orient Decide and Act. The ideas behind each step are straightforward but the most important part of the process which doesn’t have a letter in the acronym is the debrief/feedback loop process that sends data back to the Observe step. My key takeaway from the book is leaders need to be disciplined about how they create the right cultures within their organizations which means investing in team training building trust among team members setting a strong vision and creating an environment of candid and prompt feedback. But I wish the book had more concrete examples about how to apply these frameworks on a tactical basis. Which types of training are the best for teams? How much time to invest in team building? What is the optimal way to build trust among colleagues? Today there seem to be many different methods accomplish these goals. I suspect there are some best practices out there. I’m going to find some of these and write about them in the hopes I can make the OODA and Organizational Climate ideas more immediately useful. Published 2014-01-31,Published 2014-01-31
http://tomtunguz.com/salesforce-acquisition-impact/,What an Acquisition of Salesforce Means for Startups,What an Acquisition of Salesforce Means for Startups Rumors swirled yesterday that Salesforce the $40B SaaS behemoth had been approached by an acquirer. Dan Primack speculated this morning that Oracle and Microsoft are the likely candidates. If Salesforce were to be acquired the SaaS ecosystem would change substantially. Looking at the market caps and the balance sheets of the major enterprise acquirers Microsoft could certainly acquire Salesforce outright in cash. Oracle would likely acquire the business in a cash & stock transaction. Company Market Cap $B (2015-04-29) Cash & Eq. $B Microsoft 398 95 Oracle 211 44 IBM 172 9 Intel 156 15 SAP 91 5 Salesforce 49 1 VMWare 38 7 Most importantly the number of large market cap companies capable of acquiring substantial SaaS startups would decline. In the past ten years Salesforce has been the second most active acquirer of next-generation enterprise companies at greater than $100M tied with IBM and second to Oracle. Salesforce acquires more frequently than most others but their median purchase is smaller about $400M compared to roughly $1B for the others. SAP is an outlier because of their Concur SuccessFactors and Sybase acquisitions. In terms of total transaction value Salesforce has spent $4.2B in the past five years in acquisitions greater than $100M tied with Dell and VMWare. Microsoft didn’t make the list because they’ve spent about $1.5B in the last five years on Yammer Acompli and Sunrise. Salesforce is squarely in the middle of the pack when it comes to very large acquisitions in this case ExactTarget at $2.6B. If Salesforce were to sell the M&A landscape in the startup ecosystem would lose an active acquirer. Published 2015-04-30,Published 2015-04-30
http://tomtunguz.com/data-biases/,Which Data Biases Challenge Your Startup?,Which Data Biases Challenge Your Startup? Steve Sinofsky executive at Microsoft for 24 years penned an insightful post on the five data biases plaguing product decisions. It can be easy for any founder product manager marketer or engineer accept a data point at face value as the rationale behind a decision. But understanding the nuances and biases of the data questioning the data is often just as important as the result. The corollary point argued in his post is data isn’t strategy - data can’t be blindly used to inform product design and decision making because the data might be “lies damned lies and statistics”. Steve highlights five data biases seen often in his career: Representation. No data can represent all people using (or who will use) a product. So who was represented in the data? Forward or backward looking. When looking at product usage the data looks at how the product was used but not how it will be used down the road (assuming changes). Is the data justifying the choice or informing the e choice? Contextual. The data depends on context in which it is collected so if the user interface is sub-optimal or drives a certain pattern the data does not necessarily represent a valid conclusion. Did the data consider that the collection was itself flawed? Counter-intuitive. The data is viewed as counter-intuitive and does not follow the conventional wisdom so something must be wrong. How could the data overlook what is obvious? Causation or correlation. With data you can see an end state but it is not always clear what caused the end-state. If something is used a lot crashes a lot or is avoided there might be many reasons most not readily apparent or at least open to debate that cause that end-state. Is the end-state coincident with the some variables or do those variables cause the end-state? In my day to day the correlation or causation one is most common. When evaluating a businesse’s performance it’s easy to assume that one metric (new feature release) causes another to increase (engagement) but making that leap isn’t always correct.

http://tomtunguz.com/what-to-look-for-when-hiring-a-data-scientist/,What to look for when hiring a data scientist,What to look for when hiring a data scientist Over the last six months I’ve been delving deeply into R linear regressions and machine learning. Part of the rationale has been to remember some of the concepts I learned in grad school studying signal processing. But a more important driver has been the need to better understand how to qualify evaluate and hire data scientists because data science is a massive competitive advantage. And many of the companies I work with are hiring data scientists. Support Vector Machine Visualized Finding the right person to model your data and generate insights can provide massive leverage for your company. But understanding what to look for in a candidate is a challenge. In my view when hiring a data scientist one should look for three main skills with a bonus fourth: data processing data analysis data modeling and system architecture. Data processing Perhaps the most undervalued skill data processing is the ability to transform data from its current form into a form that can be analyzed. Often data scientists have to extract data from many different internal databases meaning a knowledge of SQL is important. Also scraping data from the web or from pdfs is quite common so mastery of scripting is essential. Last a basic knowledge of Unix to access databases through command line and through secure channels is important. Data analysis After data is processed it must be analyzed. Data analysis is the application of statistics to data to understand what the data imply. Almost anyone can use Excel to build a summary analysis of averages and medians. But without a good grasp of statistical significance the distributions underlying the data and data bias (like survivorship bias) statistics and data can lead companies to the wrong decisions. So a strong data scientist needs to understand the theories of statistics including the central limit theorem the different types of distributions statistical significance testing and so on. Data modeling Last data is modeled. Data science becomes a weapon when the vast amounts of data a company collects can be used to predict or inform business decisions for example prioritizing a sales funnel or determining what to pay for an ad impression in real time. This is data modeling / machine learning. There are many machine learning methods: neural networks support vector machines linear regression regression trees k-nearest neighbors. And the application of these methods isn’t challenging. But implementing them is only the first 20% of the work. The rest the 80% is tuning the models to make them perform. Fire up R and type lm() or rpart() and you have a linear model or a regression tree. The odds are that the data fed into the model won’t be the right one the first time. And that the data will need to be cleaned or transformed. Many different models will need to be run compared and contrasted until one that has a strong enough prediction capability is found. Experience tuning models is essential. System architecture The bonus skill is system architecture. Ultimately machine learning systems may be deployed into production environments - like Netflix’s recommendation algorithm. Data scientists who understand how to integrate their infrastructure into the existing web stack without impacting performance or creating excessive dependencies are tremendous assets to the company. Modeling data scientists Now the challenge for me is building a model to tell me where to find these great data scientists. If you find someone who can do that send them my way.

http://tomtunguz.com/postmortems/,Not Sharing the Opportunity to Learn is a Cardinal Sin,Not Sharing the Opportunity to Learn is a Cardinal Sin I have never worked for a company that was dogmatic about project postmortems but I have always wished I had. After all project postmortems teach us so much. Learning from the mistakes and experiences of others constitutes the better part of our business education. It’s why we ask successful entrepreneurs to coffee and hang on every word when they speak at conferences. All those stories are postmortems. Postmortems condense all the experience and learning into a nugget of shared wisdom. Despite their value postmortems are uncommon. They exist only in delicate corporate cultures that demand excellence but support learning. Harder still framing one’s own failure to colleagues daunts the entry-level employee as much a seasoned CEO. It’s rare to find an enterprise that conducts postmortems consistently. Very few startups do. But I came across one business in a sector I wouldn’t have expected that exemplifies the value of the everyday post-mortem. Alcoa the Aluminum Company of America generates $24 billion in revenue and for decades held the title of largest aluminum producer in the world. In the mid-1980s the company hired Paul O’Neill as CEO. O’Neill changed the course of the business and doubled revenues in ten years because he instilled one particular value in the company. Unlike his predecessors who focused on increasing profitability to drive market cap O’Neill championed safety as priority one from his very first shareholder meeting. This ostensibly odd decision created a cascade of cultural changes within Alcoa. First it united the interests of managers and unions who had been at odds over wages and benefits. After all both sought safer working environments for their teams. Second because every accident needed to be reported in a timely fashion according to company policy Alcoa became one of the first large enterprises to adopt email. Last as employees focused on reporting accidents quickly and widely the company cultivated a culture wherein people learned from others’ mistakes and everyone benefitted as a result. Accident rates plummeted productivity rose and the business boomed. A few years into O’Neill’s term at a shareholder meeting a Mexican nun (who was a shareholder of Alcoa) pointed out to the CEO that some members of her parish had suffered exposure to toxic gases working for Alcoa. The company investigated. They discovered that one of the most senior and tenured members of the management team Bob Barton had covered up the gas leak. O’Neill fired Barton immediately. O’Neill said later “…no one else had the opportunity to learn [from the accident]. Not sharing an opportunity to learn is a cardinal sin.” And his employees agreed. Postmortems demand a culture of honesty and communication two of the core values of the strongest relationships and cultures. I hope we see more of them in startups.

http://tomtunguz.com/partnerships/,Distribution partnerships for startups,Distribution partnerships for startups When a startup is approached by an established company about partnership it can be a very exciting time. Sometimes partnerships change the trajectory of a startup. Other times the weight of partnerships can crush startups. Servicing a much larger partner’s needs with a small team can be a full time job and deprive the startup of any time to advance their independent projects. When evaluating a partnership the most important first-pass analysis to conduct is to understand whether in the success scenario the partnership is worth the effort by comparing the startup’s progress to a conservative estimate of internal growth. Distribution Partnership Example Below is a chart for a fast growing startup. The blue area measures the userbase which starts at 50000 users on month zero and grows 15% each month. Suppose on month one the startup signs a distribution partnership agreement that guarantees the startup 10000 users per month for 2 years. But it takes 9 months to complete integration work set up the marketing campaign and so on. At the outset 10000 users per month is a big deal - an additional third of the user base. But a year later the partnership is driving only 7% of new users. As a fraction of all users the partnership has driven 14% of all users. And the value of the partnership decreases with time. Net-net Upside Was the 9 months of integration work worth the effort? One way to answer this question is to estimate what additional features or marketing initiatives could have been launched using the time allocated to integration. And their corresponding impact to growth. If our startup could grow 1.5% more per month because we allocated the time to internal initiatives instead of the product in three years' time the user base would be nearly twice as large - and growth remains under the startup’s control. Skate to where the puck will be The decision to pursue a partnership is complicated. There are considerations of the increase to brand value access to new potentially more lucrative customer bases access to new forms of technology and many other potential advantages. But a good first pass filter is comparing the success scenario to a reasonable estimate of exclusive internal growth. Published 2012-11-13,Published 2012-11-13
http://tomtunguz.com/growth/,The Secret to Growth Hacking,The Secret to Growth Hacking Could you grow your users at 5% for 15 months? Or at 7% for 12 months? Or at 10% for 9 months? That’s how long it would take to double your user base at those growth rates. Though there is some science to growth developed by the technology-fluent marketer aka growth hacker growth remains a confounding art because there isn’t one feature - like implementing FB Connect or promoting Tweets or having a big red button on a home page. Rather it is the sum product of a hundred little things. Growth is iteratively engendered; growth is tested discovered and explored. Growth means multivariate testing combinations of product marketing copy and design. Growth is using behavioral psychology to cajole users into doing what we ask. Worst of all growth is a playbook whose plays change with time. On Friday there is a Growth Hackers Conference in San Francisco with some great speakers presenting their experiences from Facebook LinkedIn Square and Google. I suspect the unifying theme throughout the conference will be leveraging multivariate testing software to develop continuous small short term wins into long term compounding growth. At least that’s how we grew at Google - testing different ad targeting models. Building a library of Google.com UI experiments. If there’s one constant for growth one secret it’s scalable experimentation and testing frameworks. Up and to the right up and to the right up and to the right is the mantra we all chant. Startups have to grow users engagement and revenue to survive. Consistent small wins drive the long term growth we all seek. Published 2013-05-02,Published 2013-05-02
http://tomtunguz.com/must-startup-founders-be-charismatic/,Must startup founders be charismatic?,Must startup founders be charismatic? Culturally we tend to associate leadership with extroversion and attach less importance to judgment vision and mettle. We prize leaders who are eager talkers over those who have something to say. Must great leaders be gregarious? Susan Cain wrote an OpEd this weekend in the Times containing the quote above. In Silicon Valley the culture seems very much to embrace the idea of introverted leadership. One might even say the two kinds of leaders live in harmony. On one hand there are the garrulous Jobs Benioff Ellison and on the other there are the taciturn Schmidt Page and Zuckerberg. All six of these leaders possess judgment vision and mettle. Some lead from the front voices booming and flags unfurled and some lead from the back plotting and coding. But ultimately they all lead. And that’s the most critical part.

http://tomtunguz.com/urgency-scarcity-sales-process/,The Number One Objection in the Sales Funnel,The Number One Objection in the Sales Funnel The most potent weapon in sales is understanding a buyer’s perception of time. As Mark Roberge wrote “At HubSpot this lacking sense of urgency is the number one objection we face in the sales funnel.” To succeed SaaS startups’ sales teams must consistently create urgency in the sales process. Time is scarce. Either the seller’s time is scarce or the buyer’s time is scarce. Understanding that scarcity and focusing the buyer on it is the key to repeatable sales. Seller time scarcity works well when a sales team responds to inbound demand. The inbound customer is often in the considering or intend to buy parts of the sales funnel and very close to purchase. Seller scarcity provides the final push. There are many forms of seller scarcity: offers good until a day a limited number of units available at a particular price 7 day trials and so on. Buyer urgency presents a greater challenge. To trigger a feeling of urgency during an outbound sales call a salesperson must obtain some information about a pressing business goal. When is the latest you need to X? is a probing question designed to find an urgent need within the business that justifies investing time with the salesperson. In Mark’s example from Hubspot the buyer urgently needs to increase top of the funnel leads. In Looker’s case data teams urgently need to provide data to product managers and marketers and finance teams. Other times sales teams sell an urgency to protect a business against a liability or insure the business against risk. Security companies like Duo Security seize this urgency to sell their products. Faster sales cycles are a competitive advantage. Faster sales cycles enable companies to iterate their sales techniques more rapidly evaluate sales people quicker and test marketing effectiveness swiftly. Most importantly faster sales cycles mean speedy growth which eases fundraising hiring and brand building. For SaaS startups finding product market fit is important but developing urgency consistently within sales processes is equally critical. The strategies that uncover time scarcity and focus the buyer on this urgency form the basis of great sales playbooks. Published 2015-08-18,Published 2015-08-18
http://tomtunguz.com/boiling-a-billion-frogs/,Boiling a Billion Frogs,Boiling a Billion Frogs Tracing the arc of Facebook’s user sharing model is to identify the biggest case of frog boiling in history. Contrast Facebook’s origins as a dating site limited to students attending a particular college to an exhibitionist’s dream syndicating every detail of a life across of 1000+ friend networks and potentially many more followers. The question for users is: what is the quid pro quo? What value am I gaining in exchange for my data. Is it a fair swap or a bait and switch? What do you think? Message me on twitter with your thoughts In my view the data-by product created by users is enormously valuable and fuel for innovation. Facebook’s billions in revenue is the most direct proof and the ecosystems built around the data stream are at least as large. Max Levchin’s newest company Affirm Kaggle Lending Club Lyft and others use social signals to build credit and trust signals for potentially billions of dollars worth of transactions. Pointing to the revenue of these companies as examples of corporate raiding of personal data is flawed. Consumers benefit from new forms of credit and lending market places with less friction and increased trust on the web. All web services evolve their value propositions will change and the use of user data will morph to rise to the demands of the users and customers. The challenges in privacy occur when a web service’s users and customers are different eg the case of users and advertisers. We’re still figuring out to to properly handle those potential conflicts. It’s a work in progress. For a compelling counterpoint read Juile Cohen’s paper in Harvard Law Review called “What Privacy Is For?”. Cohen argues privacy is a fundamental right of a functioning democratic society and today because of our love affair with Big Data and innovation we have cast aside any regulation or oversight of privacy. Nor do we have the tools to properly understand the type and extent of data usage. This privacy/innovation debate is fascinating because it exists at the intersection politics ethics innovation and societal values. No one wants to be a frog slowly boiled who realizes one day all privacy is gone. But the value created by Big Data is unquestionable. There’s the rub. Published 2013-02-27,Published 2013-02-27
http://tomtunguz.com/google-ten-years-later/,Not A Conventional Company,Not A Conventional Company Earlier this week Google celebrated the tenth anniversary of its IPO. I re-read the Founder’s IPO Letter and found this passage which captured so much about Google’s values: Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one…We will not shy away from high-risk high-reward projects because of short-term earnings pressure. Some of our past bets have gone extraordinarily well and others have not. Because we recognize the pursuit of such projects as the key to our long-term success we will continue to seek them out. Visiting the campus for the first time in 2005 I felt different than any other workplace I had been to. So much excitement and ambition. But that feeling was more than just a product of the rocket ship growth of the ads business. Google had grown from $220k in revenue in 19aw99 to $19M in 2000 to $86M in 2001 to $347M in 2002 to $961M in 2003 and would record $3.2B in 2004 the year of their IPO. Digging past the business revealed a wonderful culture. The thing I loved most about working at Google were the values the company embraced. For as long as I can remember Google has published its values on a page called Ten Things We Know to Be True. Some of the most visible outward signs of these values were the iconoclastic IPO process which included the the first S-1 written in plain English; hugely ambitious projects like balloon-powered internet self-driving cars and a glucose-measuring contact lens; and projects to benefit others in the form of projects within Google.org like Google Flu Trends STEM Education grants and Google Classroom. And of course the values were much more strongly visible internally: near-total internal transparency data-driven decision making and a deep respect for people’s beliefs and cultures. Not many companies post their values online or even internally. But I think that’s a mistake. Ensuring a company and its employees share a mission and a value system is becoming a more and more critical part of building enduring businesses especially to recruit retain and inspire employees. This is particularly true in the valley where the talent market is incredibly competitive. Ten years from now I’m certain Google will still be a market-leading company making bigger and bigger bets on unique technologies that both benefit their core businesses but also benefit others. And the people pushing the business forward will be ones who share and embrace the company’s mission and values. More importantly I hope more founders and leaders of startups will post their values publicly and use them to inspire their employees to build great enduring and unconventional companies.

http://tomtunguz.com/telepathy/,Great Startup Product Design Is Telepathic,Great Startup Product Design Is Telepathic I never thought learning how to write better might help me understand product design but it has. Great literature and well designed products share one defining attribute: they create a telepathic connection between the creator and the consumer. Before you chuckle and write me off as a palm reading gypsy hear me out. The idea isn’t mine but Stephen King’s. Over the weekend I read King’s blunt and inspirational autobiographical narrative “On Writing.” In this book Stephen King accomplishes two things. First he tells the story of his struggles to become a successful author. Second he explains all the tools he used to accomplish his goal. In quite a few ways Stephen King’s path to literary success parallels many entrepreneurs. His journey consisted of a modest upbringing a supportive parent and encouraging mentors and an unbridled work ethic and passion to pursue his talent which led ultimately to many best sellers and critical acclaim. While King’s story is impressive his description of writing is more compelling. At the heart of writing King writes is telepathy. The best writing conveys the thoughts of the author precisely to the reader who may be thousands of miles away or living a decade later. Despite their separation both minds see the same images. Great products evoke the same telepathy. The first time I used a Mac and it “just worked” I felt a connection. The product designer had suffered the same software frustrations as I had and solved the problem in a way that made sense to both of us and millions more. Well designed products feel human because empathy underpins their design. Like works of literature great products create a link between a product designer and a user. The product designer has an idea an image of how to solve a problem and the user faced with the product understands immediately the designer’s mind set and solution. The simple elegance of timeless writing and skillful product design are one in the same. They are the embodiment of a connection between author and reader/designer and user.

http://tomtunguz.com/spending-a-week-on-a-tablet/,The Tablet-First Retail Startup,The Tablet-First Retail Startup For retailers of any size from startup to Fortune 50 the tablet application has become more important than the mobile application. IBM’s annual Black Friday ecommerce report which tracks 800 internet retailers proves the point. Tablet users buy at a conversion rate which is 300% greater than mobile phones and despite generating only 60% of smart phone traffic drive 65% more transactions at 14% larger basket sizes. Ultimately the average tablet user is worth 3.5x the average mobile phone user. This is true even though the download ranks of the top 4 retail applications in the iTunes store are nearly identical. App iPhone iPad Difference Amazon 17 22 5 eBay 40 30 -10 GroupOn 44 54 10 Target 72 100 28 The impact of tablets will only increase. Tablet penetration in the US at 35% is roughly half that of smart phone penetration. But all the leading indicators show explosive growth in that figure. 67% of teens own both a phone and a tablet. Walmart sold 1.4M tablets on Thanksgiving Day alone increasing household tablet penetration by 1.4% in just one day. As Flurry’s data proves there is an explosion in the number of new mobile applications but more importantly 300%+ annual growth in the number of apps commanding audiences of 20M or more MAU. I don’t think any of these have been tablet first but very soon and particularly in retail I think we will see tablet-first/primarily tablet apps reach tremendous scale. The unit economics are just that compelling. Published 2013-12-02,Published 2013-12-02
http://tomtunguz.com/four-important-numbers/,Measuring Bookings MRR Revenue and Cash for Your SaaS Startup,Measuring Bookings MRR Revenue and Cash for Your SaaS Startup Yesterday I met with a bright young SaaS entrepreneur who asked me to clarify four key numbers for SaaS companies: bookings monthly recurring revenue recognized revenue and cash collections. These four numbers are critical to understanding the health of a SaaS startup and they can be quite different so it’s important to have a strong grasp on the distinctions between them. Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May … Jan ACV Bookings 12000 Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 0 Recognized Revenue 516 1000 1000 1000 1000 484 Cash Collections 3000 3000 Let’s consider a hypothetical SaaS startup called RedRocket which sells software for $12k per year and asks its customers to pay each quarter. On the 15th day of January one customer agrees to pay RedRocket $12k for a one year contract. The startup doesn’t sell any more software for the next twelve months. The table above demonstrates the differences in bookings MRR revenue and cash. The company books $12000 in January. Bookings are the amount of money customers have committed to spend with the business. The sum total of future spend is booked in the month a customer signs a contract. Companies with only 12 month contracts can report ACV Bookings (Annual Contract Value); companies with other length contracts both shorter and longer report TCV Bookings (Total Contract Value). Sometimes startups normalize TCV into an annual number to report ACV. The company records $1k in MRR (monthly recurring revenue) in January. The MRR is the annualized spend of all customers divided by 12. RedRocket reports MRR at the end of each month. So in a year assuming the customer doesn’t renew MRR drops to 0. The company recognizes $516 in revenue in January and $1000 in revenue each subsequent month through the first fifteen days of next January. In January next year the company recognizes $484 in revenue. Revenue can only be recognized for the days that RedRocket’s software is provided to the customer in this January’s case the last 16 days of the month (16 ÷ 31 x 1000 = $516). This amortization of revenue (and expenses) across time periods is called accrual accounting. The company collects $3k of cash up front from the customer and then again three more times during the year each quarter. RedRocket’s cash collections should equal the incoming cash from customers into the company’s bank accounts. Cash collections exclude financings. The recognized revenue bookings and cash collections numbers appear in a company’s financial statements. The recognized revenue is the revenue line item in a startup’s profit and loss statement. The cash collections is found in the cash flow statements (though it’s a bit hidden. See this overview to calculate it). The size of a company’s total bookings backlog can be found in the deferred income line on the balance sheet but it doesn’t necessarily correspond to annual bookings numbers (again ACV vs TCV). These concepts can be challenging at first but all these numbers are important for startups to review regularly because each describes a different and important facet of the business.

http://tomtunguz.com/followon-patterns/,Why Startups Face Increasing Competition in Raising Series As and Bs,Why Startups Face Increasing Competition in Raising Series As and Bs Has it become harder to raise money? is a question I hear all the time. On one hand the total dollars invested by VCs is relatively flat at just under $30B per year according to the NVCA. On the other hand the stories of difficulty raising series As and Bs have become a steady drumbeat. To get some sense of the patterns I analyzed 917 companies from seed through Series B over the past 14 years using Crunchbase data. I’ve divided the companies into cohorts by the year they raised their seed investment. Click on the charts to view interactive ones. The chart shows the narrow funnel seed stage companies must pass through to raise a series A. There are three observations we can make from the chart. First the number of seed investments in the Crunchbase data has increased by 4x in 4 years. Some of this growth is better data recording but I suspect the majority of the growth is driven by increased seed investments. Second the total number of Series As has also increased but it’s hard to say whether that’s data accuracy or ground-truth. Third the total number of Series Bs is remaining relatively constant even for the newer cohorts like the 2012 class. Across all these cohorts the mean success rate to raise an A after a Seed is 27% to raise a B after an A is 35% and the whole way through the funnel Seed to B is 11.5%. Said another way only 12% of companies who raise a Seed will raise a B. If you’re wondering how these trends have changed over time this next chart will answer that question for you. The x-axis shows calendar year and the y-axis shows the % of companies that raised a round. The blue line shows the percentage of companies raising an A after a seed; the orange line shows the percent of post-Series A companies raising a B; the green line shows the percent of post-Seed companies who have run the gauntlet successfully to raise a Series B. The secular decline in all of these ratios screams of increased competition. According to analysis by my partner Jamie Davidson on typical periods between financings peaks around 9 months so the follow on rates for Series Bs should be accurate up until the 2011 class which gives these startups more than 2 years to raise their B. Data from 2012 and 2013 will show lower success rates because most of these companies won’t be mature enough to be in the market for a B. Despite the noisy data it’s reasonable to conclude the financing market has become more competitive driven by an increase in the total number of startups raising seed capital and a relatively constant inflow of capital into venture capital.

I should be controlling my home lights from my phone. My coffee machine should reorder coffee from Amazon automatically and my washing machine should schedule its own maintenance. This kind of future demands that machines act with human intelligence. I’m asking my coffee machine to think like me so that I don’t have to. But we aren’t living in this world yet because it requires the synchronized deployment of three of the most advanced technologies developed in the past 20 years: wireless communication smart phones and machine learning. First all these devices must be connected to the internet via Wifi or cellular connection. This means the manufacturers of these devices must design integrate test and ship internet devices. Many manufacturers have started to believe in the benefits of subscription revenue economics and ongoing data collection from devices in the field. But hardware design cycles are measured in months and years. In addition until recently the market lacked technologies to help manufacturers build great software for their devices hence the delay. Second the broad adoption of smart phones and the vibrant application ecosystems have enabled and trained users to interact with new devices. More than half of Americans own a smart phone meaning the target market for connected devices is about 150M in this country alone and represent an attractive segment for device manufacturers. The market is primed. Last with the infrastructure to connect devices to the internet and the applications to monitor and control them in place the most important challenge remains: machine learning. Deep learning technologies will use the data aggregated from devices to enable human-like intelligence unlocking the magic of the connected devices vision. The advances seen in machine learning in the past few years have shown unprecedented gains as a result of increased processing power and better access to data. Google Now and Siri are just two examples. When machines anticipate needs and wants and solve problems without consulting their owners we will be living in the future. I believe the infrastructure the revenue model the customer base and the deep learning techniques are finally ready to enable entrepreneurs to seize the opportunity and build the future.

http://tomtunguz.com/gross-margin-trends-saas/,Why Revenue Isn't the Most Important Financial Metric for Startups,Why Revenue Isn't the Most Important Financial Metric for Startups Of the ten most important metrics on a startup’s financial statements revenue might seem to be the most important. But it isn’t. Gross margin matters more because it is directly tied to a company’s ability spend to grow and achieve profitability. Imagine two startups both selling products at $1M price points. The first has 5% gross margins and the second has 95% gross margins. The first company will be able to spend about $50k per sale on Sales & Marketing Research & Development and general operational costs. The second company will deploy $950k across those departments. That’s quite a competitive advantage for the second business. The second business can afford to pay orders of magnitude more to acquire a customer than the first and consequently grow much faster. Why might gross margin vary so much across startups? Let’s first define gross margin: Gross margin = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) / Revenue Companies reselling products they don’t produce display low gross margins. After all they must pay someone else for the goods they will sell. For example Walmart’s gross margin is 25%. They must buy produce from farmers/distributors. Ad networks pay publishers for the right to run ads on their web pages. Tremor Video’s GM is 35%. On the other hand investors prize SaaS companies because providing SaaS service costs very little and consequently these startups record very high gross margins. The median gross margin for publicly traded SaaS companies expands from 50% in year four to just under 75% in year five as the chart above shows. Hosting costs and Customer Success costs comprise the majority of SaaS Costs of Goods Sold (COGS). As we’ve seen in a few of the S-1 analyses COGS can also include professional services costs for some companies notably WorkDay. SaaS gross margins rise for three reasons. First as they grow SaaS companies amortize hosting costs for their product over a larger customer base. The marginal cost to support incremental customer on cloud infrastructure is relatively small particularly in multi-tenant environments. Second customer success teams increase their efficiency with time and scale. A few VPs of Customer Success have told me about a productivity rule of thumb they use to measure their team’s performance. A mature customer success team manages about $2 million in average contract value per manager. But it takes a while to get there and often startups’ initial customer success managers can support somewhere in the $500K- $1M range. As the team matures fewer customer success managers are needed per customer and consequently this reduces COGS increasing gross margin. Third as a SaaS startup scales sales and marketing efforts develops a brand broadens the product the business can often pursue larger customers. Many times the larger customers display a greater willingness to pay for the same product because the value of software is often much larger in dollar terms than for smaller companies. For these larger contract customers the marginal support costs are often similar to smaller companies that the contract value substantially higher increasing gross margin. At the very early stages of a startup it can be challenging to calculate gross margin correctly. If the team is only six or ten how much of each employee’s time is allocated precisely to customer support and service? Some engineering time some CEO time some sales time. It’s hard to estimate. A good accountant or CFO can help here. Gross margin is a critical number because it informs directly how much as startup can spend to grow. It’s one of the most important metrics in a startup’s financial statements. Keep an eye on it. Published 2014-10-20,Published 2014-10-20
http://tomtunguz.com/financial-statements/,A Startup's Rosetta Stone: How to Succinctly Communicate the Details of a Business,A Startup's Rosetta Stone: How to Succinctly Communicate the Details of a Business Financial statements are the Rosetta Stone for a business. They are the most succinct way of communicating how a business operates to management teams and boards who weigh the trade-offs of different investments. In the early stages of the startup financial statements aren’t used much as a management tool. They are most often used to keep an eye on monthly burn rate. But as companies grow startups hire leaders to manage marketing and sales and product and engineering. These functional teams require money to achieve their goals. Investments include recruiting structuring sales quotas developing software buying ads hosting events or expense accounts to close customers. Each functional team makes overlapping demands on the capital of the business. Different investment strategies can lead to dramatically different outcomes for a business. Being able to model and communicate those future scenarios is essential for good management. At a recent board meeting one of the companies I work with I saw a board management style I hadn’t seen before. This board member is exceptionally good at managing a business through financial statements. During the board meeting this board member surfaced many the strategic issues facing the business in the next 18 months entirely from the financial statements: the structure of the sales and marketing teams the timing of new product features sales quotas marketing budget sales efficiency and future fund raising plan. With the right lens the balance sheet the cash-flow statements and profit & loss statements tells the history of a business and projects its future. Published 2013-10-23,Published 2013-10-23
http://tomtunguz.com/balancing-sales-velocity-customer-success/,Why Your SaaS Startup Needs a VP of Customer Success Sooner Than You Might Think,Why Your SaaS Startup Needs a VP of Customer Success Sooner Than You Might Think The modern SaaS startup asks marketing to fill the top of the funnel sales to qualify and close leads and customer success to retain customers. Conceptually this trinity works in unison to grow a business rapidly. But sometimes SaaS companies struggle with this model particularly when churn rates increase in a business. The knee-jerk response may be to ask how to change the customer success team’s structure or incentives to increase the revenue at risk save rate (the fraction of dollars that might have churned if not for the efforts of the customer success team). But the churn problem may be the symptom of improper pre-qualification up-stream in the sales and marketing workflows. Imagine a very effective sales team that is able to sell freezers to eskimos. In other words the sales team closes all kinds of customers both who truly benefit from the product and those who may not. As sales velocity increases and revenue balloons churn rates rise in tandem. Pretty soon many of the prequalified customers cancel their subscription churn rates expand and the customer success team struggles to meet their target save rate despite working furiously to manage the flood of poorly qualified customers. Further investigation may reveal the sales team is selling ahead of the product and engineering team’s ability to release features. For example this could be because the product team is behind schedule. In order to decode the churn puzzle the leaders of each of these four teams (product marketing sales and customer success) must collaborate on defining the right goals for each team and balancing the needs of each. The marketing team commits to generate a certain number of leads to feed the sales team who signs up for quota depending on the product team’s ability to deliver features on time. Meanwhile the customer success team rallies to save a certain fraction of revenue. All of these goals are in tension and are interconnected. If the customer success team isn’t represented by a peer in the management team customer retention challenges triggered by events upstream may not be surfaced in time to avoid large increases in churn rates. As the chart above shows when churn rates rise a startup begins to burn much more capital to maintain the same revenue so this is an important problem. For a hypothetical SaaS company the difference in cash needs between a 4% monthly churn and a negative 4% monthly churn is close to 90% less capital. (Negative net churn occurs when the revenue from existing customer base grows fast enough to offset the loss of churned customers.) While putting off hiring a leader of customer success may seem like a reasonable business decision for fast-growing SaaS companies the investment will pay off handsomely in the form of a well aligned team properly structured goals across the organization and substantially better capital efficiency of the business.

http://tomtunguz.com/pricing-in-sems/,Pricing for SaaS Enabled Marketplaces - When to Go Free,Pricing for SaaS Enabled Marketplaces - When to Go Free SaaS Enabled Marketplaces employ elegant business models. They are verticalized SaaS companies that manage a marketplace to create winner-take-all market dynamics. SEMs can generate revenue in four ways: charge the buyer and/or supplier a software fee & charge the buyer and/or supplier a marketplace fee. In addition a startup must determine what rake to charge. At Redpoint we’ve invested in more than 15 marketplaces and have evaluated dozens more including more than 20 SEMs in the past year. Some of these are Free SEMs. So which type of pricing should SEMs pursue? These are the questions we use internally to hypothesize the best pricing models for SEMs. SEM or FSEM? Does the sector lend itself to freemium software distribution? When should a startup remove the toll to access the marketplace? We recommend startups choose freemium strategies when they meet the following conditions. The potential users must number in the millions. The conversion rates of freemium product rarely top more than 5% so the universe of users must be quite large to generate substantial revenue. The initial software user differs from the buyer. Free software becomes an education tool and lead generation to a second value proposition. The target user is difficult to acquire through traditional sales and marketing techniques because the unit economics aren’t profitable. The company possesses enough capital to sustain its development despite a long latency between product release and revenue. The company can generate meaningful transaction revenue (see transaction characteristics). There are important competitive considerations that compel the company to win as much marketshare as quickly as possible. SEMs should ask themselves the first three questions for both the supplier and the customer to develop a point of view on each. Transaction characteristics There are three dimensions that describe a transaction in a market place: frequency transaction value and supplier variability. Customers who frequently buy high value items from many different suppliers benefit the most from market places. Founders often consider the first and second. But supplier variability is equally important. If a customer varies little in suppliers then the SEM should charge a substantial software subscription fee in addition to a one-time marketplace fee. In this scenario both the customer and the supplier may use the marketplace to find each other (lead generation). But the initial introduct the supplier and customer often negotiate a long-term business contract outside the marketplace to reduce costs - a concept we call breakage. In such case the marketplace cannot capture the ongoing value of the relationship between the buyer and seller through transaction fees alone. To maximize revenue the startup should favor charging a substantial subscription fee for the software in addition to a fee on the first transaction. Frequency and transaction value are often inversely correlated. From our research most SEMs charge between 5-15% of gross merchandise sales in rake. Among consumer marketplaces there is quite a wide dispersion on rakes which might foreshadow similar variance in the SEM world. Also these fees tend to be higher when the marketplace manages the payments rather than providing leads. Total Addressable Market Market places either shrink their market or expand the market. Marketplaces shrink the market when the total number of transactions remains constant but the fee revenue in the sector compresses because the marketplace eliminates middlemen costs and so depresses total revenues. Other times marketplaces increase the demand for a product by reducing friction and new customers enter the market. An SEM’s pricing model should reflect the founder’s thesis on market size expansion or contraction. The more an SEM will compress a market the greater the importance of software revenue and the less attractive the FSEM option becomes. SEMs should consider giving software away for free when they can generate substantial revenues from the marketplace alone with little breakage risk without compressing the addressable market radically and when the free distribution engenders a strong competitive advantage.

http://tomtunguz.com/mobile-innovation/,The Android-First Social Network,The Android-First Social Network Do social networks have a killer distribution or engagement advantage on Android that cannot be replicated on iOS because of Android’s openness? Will we see an Android-first social network of real scale in the near future? I think it’s a real possibility. Open platforms enable faster experimentation and more innovation than closed ones. New engagement models can be created tested and refined much more easily on Android than iOS and Facebook’s newest mobile product could be that first example despite its initial struggles. Chat Heads is a persistent messaging application that’s always present. If a friend messages you while you’re reading The Atlantic on Flipboard you can respond without leaving the magazine app. Communication is the lifeblood of social networks and a social network maximizes its value by elongating session times retaining users over the course of years and growing the network quickly. A persistent messaging application that exists across application like Chat Heads will no doubt boost those key metrics. Counterarguments abound for this idea but audience size isn’t one of them. For all intents and purposes the number of iOS and Android users is roughly the same greater than 500M. The main counterpoint is competition: Have existing networks including Skype Facebook Google Plus and the litany of mobile first messaging companies with tens of millions of users like Line Kik MessageMe Instagram WhatsApp and SnapChat already sucked the oxygen out of the room? Another counterpoint is Android fragmentation an issue Facebook is struggling with at the moment. It’s challenging to support the many versions of Android multiplied by the different device form-factors. What do you think? Could an Android first social network that uses the openness of the platform reach scale? Let me know on this Branch Follow me on Twitter Published 2013-04-22,Published 2013-04-22
http://tomtunguz.com/usability-lab/,Your Startup’s Office Is Missing a Room,Your Startup’s Office Is Missing a Room This week I visited a startup whose office had a very unusual feature: a usability lab. There I was in a soundproofed room with a table in the center flanked by two chairs one for a user and one product manager or UX researcher. On the table a constellation of web cams record a user’s facial expressions and interactions with a mobile phone or laptop while a microphone captures the user’s voice. It had been years since I had been in a similar room at Google where usability studies are more or less required for major product releases. We would invite five users at a time to visit us periodically over the development of the product. We asked each visitor in turn to sit down and begin using the new product or feature all the while speaking their thoughts. At the beginning and the end of the project we wouldn’t intervene but watch the user’s first experience in silence with great interest. Other times we focused the user on a particular element of the product by asking them to perform a task or asked pointed questions about the design of an input table or a workflow. The results of the studies always confounded me. Users would stumble through “simple” parts of the product and point out weirdnesses we thought would be accepted as universal design affordances. But that was the point: to invalidate our assumptions and find the points of friction in the product. Stepping out of the startup’s usability lab I left wondering why labs aren’t more common in post-Series A companies and incubators - and why I hadn’t suggested the idea to the entrepreneurs I work with. Despite the work required to find and study users during our product work at Google the effort always yielded a handful of key insights we might not have discovered otherwise. It is a stroke of genius on the part of this startup to dedicate a part of their office to the study of the use of their product in users' hands. After all that is the most important part of product design: understanding the user. Published 2013-07-18,Published 2013-07-18
http://tomtunguz.com/ultimate-software/,Steady and Persistent Growth to $5.5B in Market Cap - The Ultimate Software Company,Steady and Persistent Growth to $5.5B in Market Cap - The Ultimate Software Company The Ultimate Software Company is a $5.5B market cap provider of SaaS Human Capital Management software. Founded in 1996 the company initially sold licensed software and migrated to multi-tenant SaaS in 2002 with a product called UltiPro. Today more than 82% of revenues are subscription dollars. The company serves the mid-market and enterprise customers with a broad software suite that includes Payroll Human Resources Management Software (HRIS) Benefits Management Time Clock and a Self Service Portal for employees. In addition Ultimate Software sells a business intelligence product licensed from IBM Cognos. At roughly 2800 customers as of November 2015 and $583M in trailing twelve months’ revenue Ultimate Software generates about $210k in average revenue per customer which implies reveune skews toward the enterprise part of the market. The company’s financials are available for 20 years and show the progression of a company with $4M in revenue to more than $583M. Over that time period the business has grown 28% per year on average steadily becoming one of the largest SaaS companies in the world. Among publicly traded Human Capital Management software vendors Ultimate Software is second to Workday. Since 2004 Ultimate Software has generated positive cash flow. The business went public in 1998 forecasting cash flow breakeven within two years. Ultimate Software ran mostly unprofitably through 2005 and has a strong history of operating with positive profits for the last 6 years. The median publicly traded SaaS company operates with 71% gross margins. ULTI has averaged about 60% of late. This figure is depressed by professional services revenue which represents about 20% of revenue and is run at 0% gross margin. However professional services’ contribution to revenue has fallen from 32% in 2010 to about 20% likely because ULTI is moving into the mid-market and the product has improved so less service is required to satisfy customer needs. This decline in professional services revenue as a fraction of total revenue has boosted overall margin. Ultimate Software spends about 25% of revenue on sales and marketing which is half of the publicly traded median of software companies and they are growing at roughly the same rate as companies of their age - about 23% annually. The company’s sales efficiency has varied quite a bit over the past twenty years but has exceeded 1.0 only once - during the year of the IPO. On average the company generates about $0.44 of gross margin per sales and marketing dollar invested. In part the relatively lower gross margin contributes to this figure. In addition the presumably long sales cycles to win F500 contracts for this critical piece of software weigh some too. Ultimate Software is right on the median for engineering spend at 16% of revenue. The Ultimate Software Company - name notwithstanding - is a great example of an enduring software company that has thrived for over 20 years with steady growth driven by disciplined investments into growth and product.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-idea-factory/,The idea factory,The idea factory This morning I listened to an interview of Jon Gertner who has published a chronicle of Bell Labs called the Idea Factory. In his book and the interview Gertner highlighted points about the Bell Labs that relate to Clay Christensen’s recent New York Times editorial the Capitalist’s Dilemma. Bell Labs was a house of magic - a place of prodigious invention and innovation. In a single year Bell scientists and engineers the transistor satellite communication and information theory (the theory that underpins all digital technologies). The advances pioneered by Bell have created 100 years of massive economic growth: the Internet digital communication semiconductors for the US. In the Capitalist’s Dilemma Christensen divides innovations into three types: empowering innovations (the transistor the engine fiberoptics) which create new markets industries and jobs; sustaining innovations (hybrid cars electric toothbrushes) which replace existing products with marginally better ones; and efficiency innovations (minimills and GEICO SaaS) which reduce the market size and jobs through automation or other efficiency gains. Christensen laments that American innovation has transitioned from empowering innovations to sustaining innovations to efficiency innovations - hollowing the job market. But I think it’s too narrow a view. Monopoly drove innovation at Bell Bell Labs was able to focus on long-term empowering innovations for one reason: they were a government sanctioned vertically and horizontally integrated monopoly that benefited from massive guaranteed cash flows for decades. Bell controlled 90% of the telephone lines and service in the US. They would count on the subscription revenue growing as the market grew and without much competition none of their customers would churn. Because of the predictability of their revenue they could afford to take a very long term view of product development and invest $50M into a project that wouldn’t succeed. Or invest $100M in a 15 year project to upgrade all mechanical switches in the telephone infrastructure to electric ones. Their enormous balance sheet enabled them to undertake the large risks that are essential to building empowering innovations. In addition researchers at Bell Labs moved freely between academia government and the labs. Because of the cross-pollination of research across disciplines they were able to advance very quickly. Startup balance sheets limit empowering innovations Christensen argues we’re pursuing the wrong kind of innovation because of system challenges. Startups lack the cash to afford long term technology development. Sometimes startups build empowering innovations by commercializing research from universities - OpenFlow networking is powering companies like BigSwitch. Other times venture investors may invest ten or twenty million for technology developments at great risk. But this happens too infrequently and at too great a risk to the investor. It’s the same argument that no startups are working on hard problems anymore. Other times big companies with huge balance sheets produce these empowering innovations like Yahoo/Google with MapReduce or Google’s Fiber initiative. These are more reminiscent of the Bell Labs innovation. But these are scant in number. Sometimes the government gets involved like they have with solar power and electric cars. The great hope is the circle completing itself In my view the the most exciting possibility of large scale and real empowering innovation creation isn’t any of these because they all drive only very small volumes of innovation. Instead my hope is that the efficiency innovations allow new startups to create empowering innovations. Faster processors and server management tools (sustaining and efficiency innovation) enabled cloud computing an empowering innovation. This cycle drives the valley and the economy forward. To despair that we aren’t building important or truly disruptive innovations is to have a very short term view of innovation. Every step forward is a step forward. Some are bigger some are smaller. Sometimes these steps occur within monoliths and sometimes they occur within startups. Sometimes they occur three in the same year sometimes it takes thirty years to make a breakthrough. The most important thing is that the ecosystem (government education private enterprise capital) continues to foster innovation. The rest will take care of itself.

http://tomtunguz.com/negotiation-take-aways/,On negotiation,On negotiation We negotiate every day in almost every conversation and exchange whether it’s rescheduling a flight asking for a product return or responding to a term sheet. I’ve been reading Getting More a book by Stuart Diamond who trains the military Google and many others on negotiation. Everyone should read it. This book is set apart because it recognizes the nature of relationships emotion and human nature forgoing concepts like ZOPA and BATNA. Instead the book focuses on simple tangible tactics: Write your goals down - Focus on achieving those goals and don’t get bogged down by any tangents. Practice ahead of time - We practice all the time in sports but rarely in business. Little wins - Negotiation is about small concessions. No one succeeds by asking for the moon. Understand the other side - Walk a mile in the other person’s shoes to understand what’s important. So you can…. Trade your low value for their high value - Neither side values things equally. Finding out what’s can be traded at high/low perceived value is the key to enlarging the pie. No emotions ever. Long term relationships - Life is long and the valley is small. Make sure to build your reputation with your negiotiating behavior. (Hat tip:@jmatus) Negotiation is a universally applicable skill and one which can evoke dramatic changes in our lives. It’s worth investing the time to become better at it. Published 2012-08-24,Published 2012-08-24
http://tomtunguz.com/bitcoin-iot/,What Bitcoin and Internet of Things Startups Have in Common,What Bitcoin and Internet of Things Startups Have in Common Bitcoin has captivated the imaginations of many with its quasi-anonymous hyper cost-efficient payment network. The potential for Bitcoin to change foreign exchange is hard to overstate. In the same vein the technologies that enable the internet of things (IoT) like Bluetooth Low Energy and Apple’s Beacons and Electric Imp’s infrastructure will transform the way we interact with the physical world to something akin to the mall in Minority Report. The startups that bring Bitcoin and IoT to the mass-market won’t declare themselves Bitcoin companies or connected devices companies. I’ve never seen a computer marketed as a TCP/IP machine or a bank that promotes the ACH compatibility of its checking accounts or a social network trumpet its H.264 codec support. I doubt I ever will because supporting a protocol isn’t a value proposition that attracts end users. Instead these disruptive startups will market a product which although enabled by Bitcoin and IoT technologies wrap and hide the underlying protocol in a product that is significantly better than the competition. I suspect the first mass-market successful Bitcoin company won’t have Bitcoin (or any subset of the word) in its name. This startup will market itself just the same as a competing financial services company but offer significantly lower fees for remittances or foreign exchange. Similarly on its website Nest maker of connected thermostats and smoke detectors never mentions never mentions the words Internet of Things. Even the word Wifi is only found on its customer support pages. Most of the time protocol support is table stakes. Gmail Hotmail Outlook and others all speak the same language IMAP so users can send emails back and forth. Other times new protocols like the ones underpinning Bitcoin and IoT enable disruptive products that solve customer needs in novel ways. In these cases it’s not the particular protocol that matters but the benefit to the end user. Thanks to Nick Shalek who inspired this post. Published 2013-12-06,Published 2013-12-06
http://tomtunguz.com/outsourcing/,A Startup’s Guide to Outsourcing,A Startup’s Guide to Outsourcing During the life of a startup the question of outsourcing can arise frequently whether for PR marketing product design sales or engineering. Outsourcing can be very attractive: consultants bring new points of view relevant experience and (potentially) immediate results. Of course consultants charge high fees and after their contract expires they leave with their knowledge and insights in tow. Founders may be challenged when deciding when and what to outsource. To simplify the decision reflect on your startup’s key competencies needed to win your market. Like people startups must focus on a few key skills to be successful. Typically startups win share by focusing on their strength: product design sales effectiveness marketing deft or technology advantages. Startups never should outsource their main advantage or the skill required to win in the market. If a team of founders believes product design will revolutionize mobile social networking the team would blunder to outsource that design. Instead the startup must cultivate a team to master that discipline. Other terrible candidates for outsourcing include long term projects without clear success metrics. The high churn rates of the PR industry reflect this reality. Most PR firms strive to win business work diligently for a few quarters and then wane as ideas for stories become exhausted and new clients arrive. In my experience hiring PR firms for particular launches and events works well. Otherwise anointing an internal storyteller and empowering that person to achieve long term goals achieves success more reliably and at less cost. Startups should leverage consultants for narrowly defined non-core initiatives when developing an expertise isn’t valuable to the business. For example AirBnB didn’t need to build an internal team of cameramen to photograph the insides of homes all over the world. Consultants offer tremendous leverage to a business and work best when tasked with ancillary commodity services not required by a startup to win their market. What are your lessons from outsourcing?

http://tomtunguz.com/unbundling-of-social-networks/,The Greatest Challenge to Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter is Unbundling,The Greatest Challenge to Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter is Unbundling Craigslist’s generic market place gave rise to fifty or more single-purpose alternatives some of which are quite valuable companies: AirBnB Care.com 99Designs oDesk CustomMade Gazelle. Each of these startups operates verticalized market places that solve customer problems better than Craigslist’s generic platform. In so doing these startups have grown their observed markets. The same unbundling trend will happen to social networks. Generic social networks will continue to succeed. But their most attractive users in the best segments will be systematically poached by verticalized competition. Today in the US there are three major generic social networks: Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter. Personal professional and news networks. In each case they serve a vast cross-section of people. Facebook’s dominance is challenged by mobile-first messaging applications. Some of these offer a better product experience for core functions (Instagram WhatsApp) others offer localized products that feel more native (Line WeChat) and others still offer better tools for self-expression (Tumblr) and last others offer more intimate networking (Path Avocado Couple). LinkedIn host to the world’s resumes and workflow tool for recruiters is challenged by dedicated professional communities offering workflow tools on top of social graphs. SpiceWorks is a community of IT professionals that also provides IT management services. Axial is an online network that helps connect buyers and sellers of private companies. Doximity is a social network for doctors that provides secure collaboration for cases. Each of these segments represents tremendously valuable audiences whose these products could have been built on LinkedIn but are better served by dedicated tools. Twitter the news syndication and discussion component is challenged by services like Quibb and Yammer which use smaller social networks to filter and discuss news in particular professional news. Make no mistake each of the major social networks like Craigslist can continue to thrive despite unbundled competitors. But many of the most valuable users and products will be built outside of the ecosystem. Unlike Craigslist these social networks have far more capitalistic cultures much larger balance sheets and are on the whole much more acquisitive which in the long term might be their best defense.

http://tomtunguz.com/uber-ride/,My Surreal UberX Experience,My Surreal UberX Experience Last week I had a surreal experience with Uber. It was mid-morning on Friday and I pushed a button to request an UberX as I walked out of Sightglass the coffee shop deep in the South of Market district. When the car arrived a few minutes later I got in. Without saying a word the driver passed me his iPhone. Confused I looked up from my emails and he mouthed to me “I am deaf.” I understood and typed in my destination in South Beach into his Google Maps and returned his phone to him. Away we went. A few clicks on my phone later I found the gesture in sign language for thank you touching my chin and moving my hand forward. I signed “thank you” as I stepped out of the taxi cab. During that drive I marveled at the change in the world over the past ten years. Instant taxi. Instant directions. Instant translation. Instant payment. The barriers impeding communication and commerce are being demolished one at a time.

http://tomtunguz.com/social-media-bd-mechanization/,Mechanizing business development with social media,Mechanizing business development with social media Last year I set a goal of adding 100 followers each week starting at 2000. I crossed the 3500 follower mark on Twitter this week. I’ve fallen a bit behind that goal but I have a wonderful group of people who actively engage with me on Twitter who are interested in the same things I am. As I’ve been cultivating this audience and community I kept asking myself a question: who are most of these followers? Who retweets me? Who should I meet in person and build a deeper relationship with? In other words how do I use social media to build a business development pipeline? I imagine this problem is common across social media marketers. I’ve looked for solutions to help me solve this problem. First the Twitter clients like Hootsuite and Tweetdeck. Then the Twitter analysis tools like Klout and Community and FollowerWonk. But each failed to help me prioritize because Twitter profiles are incomplete. They simply don’t provide enough data. So I built my own tool to bridge the Twitter graph and the LinkedIn graph. First I ping the Twitter API for my followers' Twitter usernames names and follower counts with a ruby script and dump those details into a csv file. Then I ask someone on oDesk to map these Twitter usernames to LinkedIn URLs. This costs less than $50 for the 3500 contacts and about 50% of the Twitter user names turn up LinkedIn profiles using Google. (Hat-tip to Brett Berson). Next I crawl each LinkedIn url for the position company and location of the user. At last I have a list of Twitter followers with full work information which I refresh every few weeks. This forms the basis of my business development pipeline. As a marketing channel social media is second-to-none. But in order for social media to benefit marketers and business development teams social graphs must be combined to build a more complete profile of users. NB: I tried mapping Twitter usernames to LinkedIn profiles using the LinkedIn APi but as far as I can tell the LinkedIn API doesn’t support this. Published 2012-09-14,Published 2012-09-14
http://tomtunguz.com/new-relic-s-1/,Benchmarking New Relic's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking New Relic's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. New Relic is San Francisco based 534 person company providing tools for engineers to understand how well their code is performing. The company operates in the Application Performance Management category which New Relic calls Software Analytics. Engineers insert code into their applications which sends data to New Relic’s servers. New Relic processes this data and provides interactive reports to identify underperforming code. New Relic charges by the server - the more computers monitored the greater the subscription fee. Today the company counts 250000 users and 10590 paying customers. An interesting sidenote: the name New Relic is an anagram of the founder’s name Lew Cirne. In the next seven charts we’ll explore how New Relic built their business. We will explore revenue growth average revenue per customer sales efficiency payback periods net income gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots I’ve used New Relic’s colors as a consistent legend. New Relic company data is teal median values are black and other company values are gray. All the data come from New Relic’s S-1. If I were to use only one chart to summarize why New Relic has built an amazing business it’s the following one which shows the annual revenue growth rates of New Relic customer accounts. Each year the typical customer pays New Relic 14% more than last year. In industry parlance this is called negative revenue churn. Negative churn an incredibly attractive attribute of a business because it means if the company were to cease spending money to acquire new customers the business would still grow at a 14% CAGR. New Relic achieves negative revenue churn because customers instrument increasing numbers of servers over time which costs more. The longer a customer uses New Relic the more they become accustomed to developing with all the product’s insights the more servers and applications they will migrate to New Relic’s analytics system. So despite relatively flat new account acquisition numbers which have remained at about 750 per quarter New Relic’s revenue will continue to expand because of the negative churn characteristic. As the S-1 indicates in addition to the smaller accounts that likely form the majority of the company’s customer base today New Relic is pursuing larger customers. At the time of the S-1 the company recorded an Average Revenue per Customer of about $8k. This will surely increase as the company penetrates engineering teams more deeply and the investments in sales and marketing begin to reward the company with larger contracts. But this account size easily supports building an inside sales team to scale revenue quickly. Another aside: the majority of New Relic customers pay on a monthly basis unlike most SaaS companies which move to pre-pay annual contracts. Many SaaS companies move to annual pre-pay to be able to finance their own growth more efficiently and to reduce churn. But churn doesn’t seem to be a concern for New Relic. Storing data for their customers provides the business some lock-in. The combination of negative churn account growth and pursuit of larger accounts has enabled New Relic to grow rapidly. The company reported $63M in trailing twelve months’ of revenue in their 2014 fiscal year which is right at the median. Impressively New Relic increased revenue 213% y/y. New Relic’s sales efficiency has historically been higher than the median at 1.4 but recently that figure fell to 0.98 as the company tripled its spending on sales and marketing from $10.7M to $28.4M. The S-1 indicates the company is expanding rapidly in EMEA and APAC in addition to the US all of which requires marketing spend and building sales teams. Here’s another impressive chart. New Relic’s gross margin has hovered at 83% an amazing 25% better than the SaaS median. And this gross margin has been constant for at least the past 3 years. Gross margin is revenue minus cost of goods sold. In this case New Relic’s main costs are storage and customer support/success. The incredible consistency of the gross margin might indicate the company actually manages pricing to this metric. New Relic burns more capital as a percentage of revenue than the median publicly traded SaaS company. Over the last three years the business has operated at -68% net income-to-revenue ratio twice as high as the 35% median for comparable companies. This substantially higher relative burn rate is driven by massive investment in sales and marketing. In years 4 and 5 of the company’s life New Relic has invested twice as much on a percentage basis in sales and marketing (92% of revenue) than the median company (48% of revenue). Meanwhile New Relic is on par with its peer-set for engineering investment at about 26% of revenue. This implies New Relic has been hiring sales people at an incredible clip. The business added 224 people in the past 12 months and presumably the majority of those have joined the go-to-market teams. New Relic has built an amazing company one with some stunning negative revenue churn characteristics which should set the high-water mark for public SaaS companies.

http://tomtunguz.com/what-time-of-year-to-raise/,The Best Times of Year to Raise Capital for Your Startup,The Best Times of Year to Raise Capital for Your Startup Aside from a startup’s internal considerations about the right time to raise money founders should weigh the seasonality of the fund raising market when planning their raise. There’s a rule of thumb batted around the valley that the worst times to raise capital are in the dog-days of summer and after Thanksgiving. As it turns out this aphorism is only a half-truth. Below is a chart of the dollars VCs have invested by month of year. I’m using Crunchbase data since 2005 for tech companies in the US. There are a few notable trends in the data. First the impact of the summer is evident. The slowest months for fundraising are January-March and September. I’d estimate there are a few weeks latency in the data between when the investment commitment is made and the investment is disclosed. The legal diligence process of about 3-4 weeks that typically follows signing a term sheet introduces this lag. Second setting aside the slowdown in summer VCs invest more and more as the year progresses. It’s not crazy to draw a parallel between this trend and the patterns quota attainment for salespeople in which the majority of sales arrive in the last two weeks of a quarter. VCs aim to invest a certain amount of dollars and/or in a certain number of companies each year. The later in the year the greater the time pressure the better the motivation. Third the difference from the best month December to the worst month January is substantial: a 50% delta in the total dollars invested and 50% increase in the number of investments. These differences are statistically significant with greater than 95% confidence so seasonality quite clearly exists. This analysis raises another question: is there an optimal time of year to maximize the size of an investment and presumably pre-money valuation? The data shows the average investment size spikes in August and December both of which have over the past nine years generated 15% larger rounds. The difference is statistically significant with greater than 90% confidence. Assuming a three month fundraising process the best times of year to start a financing process is in September targeting a December close when investment sizes are 15% larger than average and investment volumes are 50% larger. Starting a raise in May is the second best choice. While the average investment sizes are identical to December investment pace is much slower hence a bit riskier.

It’s a logical question to pose in the aftermath of the Digg sale and the wobbly Facebook IPO. There is one clear lesson from Digg’s sale: the technology that powered a once-massive social network is worth about $500000. The Big Digg Lesson The Atlantic summed up the essence of social networks' business models brilliantly. It’s not the technology that’s intrinisically valuable but the activity on the network that attracts users and advertisers and produces a data by-product. Once users commit to a network the network must develop a revenue model based upon the content created by the users. In so doing social networks can generate huge revenues quite profitably. But these networks don’t all go to market the same way. Below is a draft taxonomy of social network revenue models. Comments welcome. Media Social Networks (MySpace Facebook Twitter Pinterest) - Media networks' primary insert ads into the experiences of potential customers. MySpace generated hundreds of millions of dollars by selling home page take overs and remnant ads. Facebook generates billions by providing more granular targeting across a much larger user base. Leafing through the pages of history this is no different from the business of phone books: create a listing of people’s name and contact details and businesses will soon follow paying for inclusion. To date ad dollars have formed the largest fraction of social network revenue dollars. Pinterest is a bit different in that advertisers will be able to drive transactions directly from whatever advertisement or sponsorship products Pinterest builds. But this is still a media business just with a performance oriented advertiser base. Data By-Product Social Networks (LinkedIn PatientsLikeMe) - Data by-product social networks offer free services to the main user base but sell some data product to a different customer set. LinkedIn and PatientsLikeMe have cultivated vibrant communication networks. To generate revenue they collect filter serve and sell the data users create to interested parties: recruiters and professional networkers in the first case and pharmaceutical companies in the second case. Premium Subscription Social Networks (Yammer AxialMarket Gerson Lehrman Group XBox Live World of Warcraft Dating Sites) - Sometimes access the community is valuable enough to the end user to warrant charging a monthly subscription. Yammer charges for secure managed enterprise social networks. Axial collects fees from financial professionals to access user created deal flow. GLG collects fees to access subject matter experts. Gaming networks like XBox Live and World of Warcraft offer matchmaking and game hosting services. Dating sites offer access to a network of candidates for a fee and often will charge for relevant digital goods or rights to communicate with other members. Pro Bono Social Networks (Chat Email) - Email hasn’t generated much revenue since the days of dial-up when a subscription to Aol included an email address and chat account. Email and chat have since become commodified and are operated at or near a loss ideally winning user loyalty on behalf of adjacent properties. If you use GMail you’ll likely use Google.com more often. Freemium Social Networks: (Line) It’s hard to argue with Line’s strategy of virtual goods and stickers. Line’s 150M users spent nearly $60M on these goods in Q1. By leveraging a network effect and capitalizing on its users' desires to express emotion and individuality Line has grown tremendously. To Be Determined Social Networks (FourSquare Tumblr Quora Instagram) - For many of the newest social networks revenue models are still nascent. Discovering the most natural form of monetization within a community is challenging. Some networks never need to find it (Instagram). Others spend years searching for it. Perhaps this group’s revenue models will fall into the above categories. Or perhaps they will create a new form of revenue model. Social networks have only existed for about 7 years. In that time we have witnessed the growth of a few hegemonies and scores of niche players. We have retrofitted revenue models from previous eras of Internet businesses. But the data quality and density found in social networks are unlike most other computer systems. Networks are still exploring the alchemy of converting social media data to gold. One day it will be a science. Published 2013-05-15,Published 2013-05-15
http://tomtunguz.com/trends-startup-acquisition-market-2015/,Trends In Startup Acquisition Market in 2015,Trends In Startup Acquisition Market in 2015 This time last year I analyzed the state of the startup acquisition market. Two key trends surfaced. First the larger acquisitions were becoming larger. Second that the total number of acquisitions in 2014 would achieve a 5 year high. As of mid-2015 the first trend continues while the second seems to have faltered. The median acquisition price for technology companies in Crunchbase’s data set is plotted above bucketed by size. For example the $500M bucket marked in yellow includes all acquisitions between $100M and $500M. Startups haven’t seen any increase in the median value an acquirer pays over the five year period. However at the top end of the spectrum companies sold for $500M or more has increased 40% over the last five years from $1.25B to $1.75B. Premium startups are fetching higher premiums than in recent history. Many technology incumbents possess substantial cash balances  which enable them to make substantial acquisitions. But M&A velocity has slowed in 2015 compared to 2014 - at least through the first quarter. The chart above plots the quarterly number of acquisitions again by size. Q3 and Q4 of 2014 saw record high activity over the last five year period. 2015 Q1 activity meanwhile has declined. With these changes in the acquisition market the relative share of acquisitions has evolved too. $100-$500M acquisitions are now the most common displacing the $0-50M. This may be because fewer smaller acquisitions are disclosed or it may highlight the waning of the acquihire era a time in Startupland when large incumbents acquired startups at substantial premiums principally for their talent rather than technology or revenue. On the whole 2015 has seen a decline in M&A activity though premium companies do command higher prices than before. Coincidentally venture backed startup IPOs have also seen a weak first quarter. It’s hard to say why M&A and IPO activity have seen declines in 2015. I suspect a big contributor may be the availability of venture and growth capital. Why sell the business if it’s easy to raise capital to grow it and make it even more valuable? Published 2015-06-30,Published 2015-06-30
http://tomtunguz.com/books-about-entrepreneurship/,9 Books Every Entrepreneur Should Read,9 Books Every Entrepreneur Should Read Some of the best content to be found about startups is locked in books. Thomas Kjemperud asked me yesterday for a 140 character recommendation of one book for founders. Reducing my list to just one and condensing an argument for why founders ought to read it in just 117 characters was just too great a challenge for me. Instead I’ve written a blog post about the nine favorite books I’ve read over the last five years have helped me understand startups and the processes that make them successful. They range from written 70 years ago to written in the past 3 years. They have been written by salespeople CTOs speechwriters consultants and magnates. These are the books I go back to time and again when I have a question or I’m looking for an insight. If they weren’t all e-books they would be dog-eared and foxed. Here they are: How to Castrate a Bull describes the creation and dramatic success of NetApp the storage company. Unlike most business stories which are penned from the point of view of the CEO this one is written by the CTO/founder David Hitz. Hitz lived on a ranch in his youth and draws parallels between the activities on the ranch like castrating bulls (!) and building a startup. For example from Hitz’s point of view politics is the art of getting groups of people to come to a common conclusion by developing consensus. Consensus is a state where all are willing to provide their consent for a decision to take place - not necessarily reaching total agreement but allowing for the process to go forward. Other chapters focus on risk including evaluating the risk of entering new markets of changing corporate culture and attitudes and of changing CEOs. The Essential Drucker condenses the extensive writings of Peter Drucker one of the most respected management thinkers of the last century. I’ve written posts about his views on Communication Optimal Team Sizes The Myth of the Generalist a team member’s Obligation to Dissent. Drucker coined the term information worker and presaged the changing nature of work resulting from people managing data instead of machines. Despite the age of his writings many of his insights ring true today. Business Model Generation proposes a visual technique for creating and understanding business models for companies. Each time I meet with a company I write down the BMG framework in my notebook and fill it in. The BMG is clear and simple but comprehensive. The book also includes many examples of successful companies’ models which helped me understand those companies better. But for founders it’s a good technique to think through different ideas. Predictable Revenue is the classic SaaS sales handbook. Written by Aaron Ross one of the first salespeople at Salesforce Predictable Revenue is one of the first books to describe the inside sales model with sales development teams inside sales reps and account executives and the processes that unify them into one coherent performant organization. Some of the techniques described in this book have since been outmoded but the broad principles still apply. The Success Equation describes a mental model for risk. I heard about this book because David Lee from SV Angel wrote about it. I read it and I loved the concept. when we make decisions particularly business decisions our goal is always to maximize the expected value of an investment. But the expected value is a combination of both skill and luck. Playing a match of chess I have a 50% chance of winning because both sides start out as equal. That’s the luck part. But if I were to play against the Grand Master the skill part would become much more important. Understanding this equation the importance of skill and luck in each major decision involving risk helps us to ensure we are making the right calls. It’s a quick read but a fascinating book that forced me to reflect on my decision-making processes for investments. To Sell is Human who is a former speechwriter for Al Gore penned this book to proclaim dead the hard sale. Pink’s book argues that the most successful salespeople today unlike 30 years ago are the ones who listen to customer needs and match a product’s features and functionality to serve those needs. With a huge volume of information about different products at their disposal today’s customers are far more sophisticated and consequently demand a different sales process. This book made me reflect on the right characteristics of a salesperson within a company that is pursuing an education sale versus an execution sale. Like Peter Drucker Peter Senge is another extraordinary management thinker. In his book The Fifth Discipline Senge Describes the four principles that have been well covered in management science before: team learning shared vision mental models and personal skills mastery. But the fifth one the one the book is named after is Senge’s stroke of genius: systems thinking. Systems thinking despite its esoteric name is actually quite simple. Systems thinking means looking at a business as a collection of positive and negative feedback loops. Virality is a positive feedback loop. Poor customer support experience leading to churn is a negative feedback loop. Senge argues that management teams ought to consistently develop an understanding of the feedback loop that govern their business and manage those loops actively. High Output Management is Andy Grove’s seminal work on management. It is the origin for the practice of OKRs the management technique that Intel and Google among others use to set goals for the company and align everyone in achieving those goals. Zero to One is the compilation of Blake Master’s notes from Peter Thiel’s Stanford class. There are some profound insights in the book. My favorite is the idea that entrepreneurs should develop a secret. A secret is not an unknown. Rather it’s something just not widely believed to be achievable or feasible. In other words it’s an insight a thesis that isn’t widely held that creates a business opportunity. Published 2014-05-08,Published 2014-05-08
http://tomtunguz.com/clearing-content-transition/,A Simple Tool to Organize Remember and Deliver Your Important Presentations,A Simple Tool to Organize Remember and Deliver Your Important Presentations At Google Product Reviews were held on Fridays at 130pm in a big room with a long table two projection screens at one end and red couches along the walls called Marrakesh in Building 42. Each week Eric Larry and Sergey invited three product and engineering teams to present their progress each for about 30 minutes. On several occasions I updated the executive team on the status of our team’s project social network monetization. Needless to say especially the first time but really every time I was nervous about the presentation. I was lucky to work with an amazing team of engineers marketers and sales people and I wanted to convey how hard they were all working and how much progress we were making. So I spent a long time putting together the presentation. I worked with a management coach to work on a few things. First increasing my speaking volume so people would hear and listen easily. Second eliminating as much as possible ahs and ums and curbing distracting fidgety movements with hands. Third and most importantly crafting a story to flow through the slides. The last one is always the hardest for me. To help me with this problem my coach shared with me a tool I use every time I make a presentation called Clearing Content Transition. CCT is a simple way to organize remember and deliver your presentation. Click! A new slide pops up. First you Clear it. Tell the audience what’s on the slide so they understand what you’re presenting to them. “This is a chart showing our company’s growth rate over the past year.” This ensures they will stop reading the slide and pay attention to you when you deliver your content. Second relay the key message of the slide the Content. This is the one main idea you want to convey from the slide with a few supporting data points anecdotes or concepts you would like to share. “In Q1 we grew 50% because we launched a new feature…” Third and before you advance to the next slide Transition. The transition is one sentence laying the foundation for the Clearing of the next slide. “We are able to maintain this growth rate because we have the best team…” Click! Now it’s time to clear the team slide. And so on until the last slide. In the speaker notes of my slide decks you’ll find Clearing Content and Transition notes for nearly every slide. I fill them out as I’m outlining the story or after the deck has been created. Knowing these three things about a slide helps me present with confidence. All I need to remember are what’s on the slide why it’s important and how I’m getting to the next one. The presentations we gave in Marrakesh improved each time we gave them. I became a bit more confident delivering the updates each time a bit more familiar with the people and most importantly a bit more comfortable with the material because I had a consistent framework to deliver the story.

http://tomtunguz.com/three-questions-head-of-sales/,The Three Questions to Ask When Hiring Your Startup's Head of Sales,The Three Questions to Ask When Hiring Your Startup's Head of Sales Mark Roberge the Chief Revenue Officer at Hubspot has spent 20 years in startups. As he told me a few days ago he has observed the lack of sales management and sales execution skills as one of the most consistent deficiencies limiting the potential of early stage SaaS companies. Sales execution deficiency manifests itself at roughly the same time as product market fit. There might be 20-30 people at the startup which is generating about $1-2M in ARR with 2-5 salespeople. Most of the time this startup is the first sales experience for both the founders and the sales people. To succeed from this point the company must cross the sales leadership chasm: recruit an ever-larger sales team manage and coach them and mechanize their sales team to grow quickly from $1-2M in ARR to $50M. The first step is hiring a sales leader. As Mark told me “Most founders fail to understand that 95% of sales leaders will implement exactly the total market strategy they employed at the last company.” They will hire the same people from their network structure the compensation plan identically and apply the same sales processes and strategies. Frequently the first sales leadership hire is the hardest because it’s difficult to ascertain the right characteristics of the ideal candidate. Mark shared his three top questions he advises founders to ask head of sales candidates during the recruitment process. They are: Knowing what to do about our business what kind of sales methodology would you run? And how does that compare to your previous role? What are the differences between your previous company and this one? What kind of salespeople would you hire and how do they differ from the people you have hired in the past? How would you structure the compensation plan to meet the needs of our business? When interviewing head of sales candidates founders should have decided the kind of sales model they would like to exploit whether inside sales field sales freemium or channel - or some combination. During the interview process they should explain to candidates the nuances of their sales processes to better understand how candidates would adapt the processes they know to the uniquenesses of this particular business. In these interviews founders and board members should determine whether or not a candidate can combine what they have learned to previous roles and the new information about this particular company to forge an alloyed go to market strategy that serves this business well. The right candidate needs to be an alchemist someone who is willing to experiment and tinker with the model not just copy a previous model by rote. Published 2015-11-17,Published 2015-11-17
http://tomtunguz.com/linkedin-s-1/,Benchmarking LinkedIn's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking LinkedIn's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up Since LinkedIn’s IPO in 2012 the company has grown its market cap by 6x and as of this writing is worth about $27.5B. Second to Salesforce LinkedIn is the second largest SaaS company in the world. Unlike most SaaS companies which are B2B LinkedIn is a B2C2B company. LinkedIn attracts hundreds of millions of consumers to post resumes online and sells this data and access to its audience to advertisers and recruiters and salespeople. The intrinsic data and people network effects of the business create reinforcing feedback cycles that have helped the business achieve tremendous revenue growth. By every measure LinkedIn is a remarkable business. It’s one of only two SaaS companies to break the $500M in annual revenue mark and has done it with an incredible growth trajectory tripling that number is two years as the chart above shows. This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Unlike most SaaS companies who offer a single product LinkedIn offers three: Talent Solutions Premium Subscriptions and Marketing Tools. Recruiters buy Talent Solutions to find connect with and acquire talented people. Salespeople buy Premium Subscriptions to network and search on the platform. And many different types of businesses buy ads to market their products to LinkedIn’s audience. In 2007 the Premium Subscriptions generated 53% of the revenue. Seven years later the SaaS part of the business the Talent Solutions part of the business brings and 56% of the revenue and has been the fastest growing part of the business. This more than any of the data point is why LinkedIn is a B2C2B. As the amount of profiles on the platform has grown so has the company’s ability to monetize that data in software. Limiting ourselves to only the Talent Solutions part of the business we can evaluate the Average Revenue Per Customer over the same seven-year period. In 2008 the average recruiting team spent about $20000 per year with LinkedIn a figure that has reached $35000 in 2013 achieving a growth rate of 16% per year. Meanwhile the number of paying customers has grown from 900 to about 25000 in that time. To acquire customers LinkedIn employs two customer acquisition mechanisms: an online acquisition team and a field sales team. In 2007 online sales generated 63% of revenue. Over the past seven years the field sales organization has flipped that figure and now represents close to 60% of new business. The field sales teams are probably responsible for the increase in customer value pursuing larger customers and closing larger teams if not entire recruiting departments. This data suggests that at the beginning LinkedIn grew primarily through self sign up and other online mechanisms but over time has come to complement that with a terrifically successful sales team. It serves as a great model for how B2C2B companies can complement their bottoms up strategy with a sales team. Because of the combined online and field sales acquisition channels and because the company serves both enterprise customers and prosumer types LinkedIn is able to achieve best in class sales efficiency. It’s a bit of an unfair comparison considering how much of the business is self sign up but it stands is an amazing figure. Even more impressive LinkedIn spent significantly less than the median publicly SaaS company in terms of sales and marketing which both includes online acquisition and field sales efforts. LinkedIn’s gross margin is 87% more than 10 percentage points above the median. This is likely because LinkedIn’s infrastructure costs and customer support costs are slower than the typical SaaS company. However LinkedIn does spend more on research and development than the median company (26% vs 18%). LinkedIn has huge amounts of data but more importantly they must solve some very complex graph problems for example search across the social network by degrees of separation which are very computationally complex. in addition it’s clear that the company is broadening their product portfolio in order to build to sell more products like Sales Navigator to increase the average revenue per customer over time. As for net income LinkedIn operates at break even which makes the company’s growth that much more remarkable compared to some SaaS companies which are operating at -70%+ net income to revenue. It’s is a testament to the efficiency of the business LinkedIn has built LinkedIn is an amazing company and the biggest B2C2B company on the planet. The sales efficiencies and the breadth of revenue streams it has created are best-in-class and they are a terrific role model for B2C2B startups. Published 2015-01-08,Published 2015-01-08
http://tomtunguz.com/option-pool-planning/,Startup Best Practices 16 - Option Pool Planning,Startup Best Practices 16 - Option Pool Planning No matter the stage of the business startups need to manage the size of their Employee Stock Option Pool or ESOP. The ESOP contains the shares set aside by the company for hiring and retaining employees. Like a financial budget ESOP budgets help a startup plan how to finance its growth. Most Series A companies create pools of 15-25% of outstanding stock. When a startup is young the equity has the potential to be quite valuable but isn’t worth very much at the time. To attract great employees the startup has to provide large grants. According to Leo Polovet’s terrific analysis of Angelist job offer data these grants vary from 0.25% to 3% for the first 34 or so employees. By taking the mid-point of the equity range multiplying by the number of employees and summing we can estimate the equity requirement to hire the first 34 people totals to 22.8%. Hence the 15-25% rule of thumb. At some point the company will have granted most of the shares in the ESOP to employees and will have to create new shares for the next wave of hiring. This is called expanding the pool. A Series A company would likely expand its ESOP as part of a Series B financing adding perhaps another 5-10% depending on the hiring plan of the company. Series C and later companies tend to add 1-2% each year to the pool; or more if they plan to hire executives who can command about 1% or more of outstanding shares. Sometimes a company expands the pool between financings. To do this the board votes to add more shares to the current share count. Each pool expansion dilutes the existing shareholders. Because the value of shares increases substantially with the growth of the startup new invested capital and diminished risk of the business new employee grants should offer fewer shares over time. However the smaller number of shares will be worth the same or more now. Often at or after the Series B startups will split their shares. Series A companies typically have 10M shares outstanding and after the Series B those 10M shares will split 1:3 or 1:4 creating about 40M shares plus those of the new round. There are many reasons to split shares but I won’t go into them here. At some point after the Series B the startup should create a compensation committee that includes the head of HR and two board members who are not employees of the company. Among other responsibilities the compensation committee establishes standard offer ranges which include salary and equity for all the levels of new hires. The compensation committee benchmarks the company’s offers against industry survey data and adjusts as necessary. In addition the compensation committee is responsible for creating an annual ESOP budget - the total number of shares the company will grant to new hires to achieve its hiring plan each year. The committee sums the theoretical equity grants according to hiring plan to calculate the budget. Using this figure the startup can determine when to expand the pool. Managing an ESOP well enables a company to achieve its hiring plan and minimize dilution to everyone else. When it’s time be sure to elect a compensation committee and manage your startup’s pool diligently. Published 2015-08-13,Published 2015-08-13
http://tomtunguz.com/professional_services/,How Important are Professional Services to Your Startup?,How Important are Professional Services to Your Startup? Hortonworks filed their S-1 last week. Reading through the document I noticed the company had quite a substantial fraction of professional services revenue; 41% of trailing 12 month revenue is services. Of the companies we have studied in our S-1 analyses Hortonworks generates more professional services revenue as a fraction of total revenue than any other company. But many companies do book a meaningful amount of revenue from professional services. The chart above shows Veeva Workday Responses and MobileIron each generate 20% or more of their revenues from professional services (PS). Typically professional services revenue isn’t valued very highly because there’s no leverage in this model. To increase revenues a PS-heavy company must hire people to perform the work so revenue is a function of hiring pace. Consequently these companies trade at smaller multiples than pure software companies. For example Accenture one of the world’s largest consulting companies trades at 1.6x revenues. Contrast this multiple to a basket of the fastest growing SaaS companies which trade at 12x. The difference in valuation afforded to companies which grow revenues by leveraging technology rather than growing headcount can be 10x! Some regard professional services as a necessary part of service large enterprises. The chart above proves the point. Compare the percent of revenue derived from professional services to the average revenue per customer (shown here in Log10 in thousands of dollars so 1 = $10K 2 = $100k etc.) and the relationship between the two becomes clear. In fact the correlation is very strong at 0.72 R^2. In other words the larger the average price for a piece of software the greater the likelihood of business will derive meaningful revenue from professional services. This isn’t a surprise. Larger customers who pay substantially more for software have much more complex environments. In order for new software to flourish within an enterprise the software most likely will have to be integrated into existing systems. This integration work constitutes the vast majority of professional services work. In addition large numbers of customer staff must be trained to use the product which also falls into the professional services bucket. Professional services isn’t a terrible thing for a business. Workday which generates a third of its revenue from PS trades at 25x revenue. The professional services fees though are heavily weighted to initial integrations and should dissipate over the course of a customer’s lifetime. So in 10 years time the vast majority of Workday’s revenue should come from software. Companies that rely on ongoing PS to create value for their customers like Accenture won’t be afforded the same multiples. There are many ways to build a massively successful SaaS company. Some companies like New Relic Zendesk and Tableau do this purely through software. Others like Veeva Workday and Responsys combine software with professional services. The larger the customer account the more likely professional services will be a significant fraction of a company’s revenue. The key for founder is to ensure that at some point professional services fees per customer declines with time and the company can leverage technology to retain to expand its revenue.

As the capacity to store this data increases so does the importance of extracting value and insight from it. Big data adoption is a four step process: generate data store data hire specialists to analyze the data and finally democratize data exploration. Today businesses lack great data exploration tools. Looker has built those tools. Two hours before a meeting with the Looker team I sent them a sizable data set. During the pitch Lloyd Tab Looker’s founder grouped pivoted and drilled into the data. He said to me “I’ve bet you’ve never really understood your data before I showed it to you on Looker.” And I agreed with him. Looker is the tool to drive the critical last step of big data adoption. Looker enables anyone within an organization to ask and answer questions of their company’s data. That’s why we invested. It’s rare for us to hear as persistent a refrain as the excitement among Looker’s customers especially at such an early stage. From a portfolio company which exclusively powers its operations-heavy business on Looker to a travel company whose sales team adopted the product and became profitable overnight Looker customers consistently operate their businesses more effectively with Looker. The team at Looker especially Frank Bien and Lloyd Tab have deep domain expertise. They worked through data challenges at LiveOps and Greenplum. Distilled from those experiences Looker’s product enables companies to model explore and explain data to make better decisions. New database technologies underpin Looker’s product. As Lloyd eloquently wrote in “Business Intelligence and the Elephant’s Chain” innovations in MPP relational databases SQL interfaces to non-relational data stores and exponential growth in computational power enable Looker’s infinite resolution business intelligence. We are excited to partner with the Looker team and help catalyze the democratization of data exploration. Published 2013-08-13,Published 2013-08-13
http://tomtunguz.com/email-unbundling/,The Great Unbundling of Email,The Great Unbundling of Email Since it was first written in 1982 the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol the mechanism for sending emails has remained largely remained unchanged. Today SMTP delivers 70 trillion emails to 5B inboxes each year. Overwhelmed by tens of thousands of emails most of us can sympathize with Nick Bilton who said: There is no escape: Email is probably most invasive form of communication yet devised. Unlike SMTP email is changing very quickly. In particular email is undergoing a great unbundling similar to Craigslist’s in which startups are seizing upon important use cases of a generic service and building a better dedicated version of it as a stand-alone company/product. This is happening to a certain extent in consumer products like ephemeral messaging (SnapChat) and location sharing (Glympse). But the trend is much broader in B2B products. I’ve seen it first-hand when we switched to RelateIQ as our CRM. Instead of going to my email inbox in the morning to see what’s new with the opportunities we’re evaluating at Redpoint I go to RelateIQ. First to be able to see across the inboxes of my partners and see all the companies we’re speaking to. Second to be able to quickly find information relevant to a particular company or person: all the email/meeting history. Third to enforce a workflow around email e.g. timely follow-ups. All of these emails to and from startups I handle within RelateIQ not Gmail. This trend of segmenting email into a dedicated smart-inbox-with-workflow is broader than CRM. Customer support software like Zendesk is probably the oldest example of an app that segments a chunk of email and wraps it with prescriptive workflow. LinkedIn’s InMail is a similar system for recruiting. Yammer has removed water-cooler emails from inboxes. Contactually segments email for network relationship management. Similarly I believe every major category of large volume workflow email will be segmented into a dedicated app in this way. Most users won’t want more than a few separate inboxes perhaps 1-3. But those 1-3 inboxes will be disproportionately valuable because users will live in those dedicated inboxes. These dedicated apps enable users to win their time back by providing all the context users need to act upon the email. Mobile is an important driver for email segmentation because the lack of contextual information makes it even more difficult to process emails than usual. Machine learning is a second key enabler because it enables filtering categorization and smart reminders. At this point in email’s unbundling the volume of email in our business inboxes hasn’t declined and it may never decline because most of the automation is on the outbound side making it easier and easier to send larger volumes of email. When both sender and receiver have intelligent workflow apps or are trained to log into workflow apps first the most effective way of reminding users to return to workflow won’t be email reminders or push messages. And then perhaps email volumes will fall. But even if email volumes don’t decline workflow-based email products will enable us to process much larger volumes of email than we are today.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-culture-of-data-science/,The culture of data science,The culture of data science In a triumph of statistics Nate Silver predicted the outcome of every state in the Presidential election correctly. What makes this story so noteworthy isn’t that it proves data enables superior decision-making to human intuition. We know the math works. Instead Silver’s success highlights and challenges the prevailing culture present in politics and in the workplace that overvalues intuition and undervalues data. Our analysis tools and our access to big data are forcing cultural change at the broadest scale. The latest field to face this upheaval is journalism. It won’t be the last. Data is the most cogent argument. Because we compare Silver’s predictions to the outcome we can understand his thought process and his logic. It’s black and white. Right or wrong. And if it’s wrong we can fix the models. Political parties journalists and startups that build cultures that use data to make dispassionate arguments and objectively measure performance will be the ones that will seemingly pull a rabbit out of a hat - just like Silver.

http://tomtunguz.com/workday-s-1/,Benchmarking WorkDay's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up,Benchmarking WorkDay's S-1 - How 7 Key SaaS Metrics Stack Up This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders. Today we’ll explore one of the enterprise behemoths both in market cap and average revenue per customer: WorkDay. WorkDay envisions being the place of record for all Human Resources data for companies with more than 5000 employees. WorkDay has grown explosively but in a very different manner than any of the previous companies we’ve analyzed (Veeva Hubspot Zendesk Tableau MobileIron or Box). Unlike these other companies WorkDay has employed a huge professional services team in addition in investing massively in their R&D to create a broad suite of products. Just how significant is the professional services component to WorkDay’s business? In 2009 and 2010 the company recognized more revenue from services than subscription. Over time that figure has fallen but it far surpasses any of the SaaS companies we’ve analyzed to date. In 2011 the year of the IPO services still accounted for 33% of revenues. Over time subscription revenue will continue to increase compared to services revenue. WorkDay deploys its professional services teams at the outset of a customer’s engagement with WorkDay when all the systems integration and data processing must be completed. It’s a critical component to customer success But this involvement decreases with time and tends to be episodic as does the revenue WorkDay generates from it. In contrast WorkDay typically signs 3-5 subscription year agreements so the subscription revenue is a substantial annuity of long duration. Nevertheless Services revenue will be a significant contributor to revenue for the foreseeable future because new accounts are the biggest driver for revenue growth according to the S-1. Over the past decade software companies have been advised to limit their services revenue to typically less than 20% of total revenues counsel which WorkDay has ignored to their great success. Behind this advice is some sage advice however. Services revenue isn’t a money-maker. WorkDay has operated its Services group at a loss or close to break-even for the three years we have data. The chart above shows these trends and compares it to the Subscription gross margin which has increased by 50% reaching 75% in 2011 in the same time period. Selling people’s time can’t be leveraged like software. In addition to developing the flagship Human Capital Management application WorkDay has been building a suite of complementary tools including Financial Management Procurement & Expenses Payroll and Talent Management at the pace of about one product per year. To achieve this enormous product breadth WorkDay spent an astounding 119% of revenue on R&D more than any other SaaS company at their stage. In dollars WorkDay $30M on research & development on revenues of $25.2M in 2009. WorkDay financed this huge investment by coupling long-term near-million-dollar agreements and nearly $200M in venture capital. The sum total of all this investment in engineering and professional services enabled by big contracts and venture capital is immense revenue growth more than tripling revenues in just two years in addition to more than $150M in deferred revenue. WorkDay reached $50M just five years after founding tying it for third fastest to $50M among the public SaaS companies in this bucket. With only 325 customers at IPO WorkDay’s revenues are driven by a $500k+ Average Revenue per Customer second only to Veeva. This figure includes both subscription and service but is annualized so the total contract values (TCV) are substantially larger at least 3-5x. Despite that huge revenue growth WorkDay has the median amount on Sales and Marketing as a percentage of revenue. And WorkDay’s sales efficiency is also at or better than the median likely because the contract sizes are so large they support significant investment in sales and marketing. Because of all the R&D spend WorkDay’s net income percentage is substantially lower than the median. But because the company has such a huge amount of deferred revenue the possibility of cross-selling the product suite and lengthy customer lifetimes it’s easy to justify this continued spend. WorkDay has built a business in a very different manner than most SaaS companies leveraging large contracts massive R&D spend and substantial professional services engagements to generate massive revenue growth and create the next monolithic enterprise company.

But until yesterday I hadn’t found anyone who had quantified the size of the movement. In mid-2014 CEB published Harnessing Business-Led IT to answer this question. While the entire report is worth reading the chart above answers the particular question above. Just how big is B2C2B? About 30% of IT spend. In their research CEB discovered that for every dollar of IT spend another 40 cents are spent by line of business owners buying software directly. In addition the data illustrates this pattern of software purchasing spans most of the key departments within a company. While sales and marketing top the list finance engineering and HR also buy software this way. As the report indicates IT purchasing occurs across four categories spanning departments: process automation collaboration analytics and customer interface with B2C2B companies most typically addressing the last three. Depending on the department CEB estimates bottoms up purchasing represents anywhere from 36 to 72% of a department’s total spend. Without longitudinal data we can’t conclude much about the pace of change in this trend. But the growth of the many B2C2B SaaS companies is a strong indicator that at some point in the next few years more than half of software will be purchased bottoms up. This is a fundamental shift. It’s an shot across the bow a battle cry a bugle call to the incumbents that they there are startups at their customers’ front doors bearing gifts. Published 2015-08-28,Published 2015-08-28
http://tomtunguz.com/learning-organizations/,Systems thinking for startups,Systems thinking for startups Peter Senge has been called the most influential business strategists of the century and in my view Senge is the successor of Peter Drucker the management visionary. Senge published a book in 1990 called The Fifth Discipline which I think every manager founder and CEO should read. Great companies transcend their great products. Not defined by one product these companies adapt innovate and reinvent. They learn continuously to succeed as their environment changes. Senge’s book teases apart the five essential components to building a learning organization. At the time the book was published the first four principles had been well covered: team learning shared vision mental models and personal skills mastery. But the fifth one the one the book is named after was Senge’s stroke of genius. The fifth discipline is systems thinking. Systems thinking sounds like an esoteric concept but it’s not. Systems thinking means understanding actions/reactions and feedback loops for a company. In other words how the actions of a company or features of a product change consumer behavior. Infed has a good description of the idea with a concrete example: ‘[In every company] whatever movement occurs is amplified producing more movement in the same direction. A small action snowballs with more and more and still more of the same resembling compound interest’ (Senge 1990: 81). Thus we may cut our advertising budgets see the benefits in terms of cost savings and in turn further trim spending in this area. In the short run there may be little impact on people’s demands for our goods and services but longer term the decline in visibility may have severe penalties. An appreciation of systems will lead to recognition of the use of and problems with such reinforcing feedback and also an understanding of the place of balancing (or stabilizing) feedback. Peter Senge These feedback loops are ubiquitous in web software. And they are found in the most important parts of product development. Whether it’s on-boarding a user driving the user to engage with a product or building mastery with a product each of these phases of product engagement relies on feedback loops to succeed (I’m borrowing heavily from a conversation with Amy Jo Kim with this paragraph). Systems thinking requires lots of deep thought. It requires taking a step back and understanding the way a company fits into an ecosystem at the highest level. I’m not sure any organization has been able to successfully engender systems thinking at every level of an organization or has been able to maintain the discipline over time. But it’s a wonderful aspiration because it can drive tremendous compounding long term gains for a company. The systems viewpoint is generally oriented toward the long-term view. That’s why delays and feedback loops are so important. In the short term you can often ignore them; they’re inconsequential. They only come back to haunt you in the long term.

In the decade to come the most successful will be united by one common characteristic. They will anticipate our needs and make us lazier. Living is hard work. So many things to remember like buying milk on the way home tonight. Plenty of software has been written to help us manage our daily torrent of to dos. In fact there is a fine app for Remembering the Milk. But it has one flaw. I still have to remember to Remember the Milk. Instead I’d prefer to worry less. Wouldn’t you? I’d like the milk (not me) to remember to arrive fresh before I pour a bowl of GrapeNuts at 7am on Monday. I’d prefer not to remember to turn the air conditioning down lock the front door of my house feed a pet pause the sprinklers after rain type in today’s workout into the treadmill or order a milk delivery. This is anticipatory computing. When technology anticipates our needs and acts accordingly we will have achieved that zenith of laziness. We will be liberated from the tyranny of to dos. We’re on the precipice of large scale anticipatory computing. Google Now predicts my destination and informs me of the traffic conditions using sensors in my phone and behavior recorded in software. Nest intelligently manages climate in houses. Lockitron secures homes. These products seamlessly blend hardware sensors and software learning to create magic. Over the next few years many more anticipatory computing startups will solve problems for consumers and achieve huge success. I can’t wait to forget about all those things I have to remember to do.

http://tomtunguz.com/quantifying-cost-bad-hire/,Quantifying the Cost of a Bad Hire,Quantifying the Cost of a Bad Hire The chart above compares the contribution of two hypothetical inside sales people with $400000 quotas to an early-stage startup’s finances. In this case contribution is the 18 month revenue of sold customers tallied cumulatively minus the salary costs of $100k annualized of the sales person. I’ve modeled a six month linear ramp for the sales person to reach 100% of quota. The red line shows the case for a successful sales hire. Through the first three months as the salesperson ramps his contribution to the business is negative because his salary costs outweigh the lifetime value of his sales. Note I haven’t included the recruiting costs here just wages and commission. Starting in the fourth month new customers closed by the salesperson begin to offset his costs and by month 5 the company is better-than-breakeven on the hiring decision on a customer lifetime value basis. The blue line shows the impact of the bad hire. The wrong person is initially hired and fired in month 3 and immediately thereafter a successful candidate is found. Because the startup must incur the quota ramp again the contribution dips 2x lower than in the success case about -$20k in month 5 and the investment on sales hiring isn’t recouped until 8 months after the initial hire. This stutter-step also has an impact on the revenue trajectory of the business as shown by the chart above. The hypothetical failed sales hire delays the revenue of the business by 3 months. As a company’s revenues grow and the number of people within the salesteam increases these effects become less and less important. But at the beginning the impact to the trajectory of a business can be material. In addition to the unquantifiable costs to company culture and moral there are three quantifiable costs of a bad sales hire: The additional recruiting costs and time of finding a new person The opportunity cost of not having converted active leads into revenue The delay in the revenue growth of the business Published 2014-04-28,Published 2014-04-28
http://tomtunguz.com/compensation-trends/,The Unexpected Compensation Trends of Post-Series A Startup Founder/CEOs,The Unexpected Compensation Trends of Post-Series A Startup Founder/CEOs There’s an interesting phenomemon occurring in founder compensation for post-Series A companies: founding CEOs are swapping cash for larger equity stakes in their companies. Founding CEO salaries post Series A have fallen by about 24% while founder equity has increased by 32%. This trend is broad. Each year Redpoint portfolio companies participate in a compensation survey along with the portfolio companies of about 50 other firms totaling about 800 startups. A third party pools the data to benchmark compensation trends across the executive functions in startups (CEO VP of Product VP of Marketing VP of Sales and so on) across the different financing series locations development stages and founders vs non-founders. While I can’t be certain why the trend towards equity is occurring I suspect that many startups are founded by younger entrepreneurs who don’t demand larger salaries and prefer equity. In any case this patterns startups in two ways: First smaller salaries for CEOs reduces burn and lengthens the time startups can iterate their way to success. In addition to reducing the CEO’s contribution to the burn rate the CEO’s salary is often the benchmark for compensation packages of most employees so lower CEO salaries cascade through the company. Second founders own more of their businesses at the same stage which means less ultimate dilution should the business raise more capital. This is likely a product of higher valuations at earlier stages. In aggregate these figures point to a friendly enterpreneurial environment one in which founders can command higher premiums for their businesses trade salary for equity and bet big on their own success.

http://tomtunguz.com/youre-not-finished-selling-until-you-change-your-customers-habits/,You’re Not Finished Selling Until You Change Your Customers Habits,You’re Not Finished Selling Until You Change Your Customers Habits It is easy to think the sales process ends once a customer has signed a contract or downloaded an app or created an account. But it’s a huge mistake. Great products have a point of view on the way things ought to work. GMail chose labels over folders for email categorization. Pandora chose recommendations over libraries for music libraries. Looker chose spreadsheets over an SQL prompts for data exploration. None of these ideas matter if they aren’t used. People try software because they like a the product’s point of view. Customers want a better way of doing things. The decision to trial a new product is aspirational. But to truly adopt new software customers have to change their habits. Users must convert their aspiration into new routines. They have to commit to the product’s point of view. A MadLib from the book The Power of Habit sums it up: I learned this selling billing and invoicing software to law firms. It was one thing to convince the managing director of a law firm to pay for the software over a 90 day sales cycle. But it was an entirely different matter to educate convince and convert individual attorneys to use the software. That took far longer. But both parts of the sales process were critical to the success of the deployment. Without the sale we didn’t make money. Without attorney adoption our product didn’t work. It had no value and customers abandoned it. The best products combine a strong point of view with the marketing and sales efforts to change the way users live and work. The sales process starts with education but has to finish with behavior change. Published 2013-09-06,Published 2013-09-06
http://tomtunguz.com/harry-potters-newspaper/,The Future of Journalism in the Touch Era,The Future of Journalism in the Touch Era I’ve always wanted to read a newspaper like The Daily Prophet from Harry Potter a daily with animated images and with articles that respond to the reader. Last week the Guardian the world’s third-most widely read paper published NSA Files: Decoded which explores the many different points of view on the NSA’s information collection efforts. As you scroll down senators and attorneys and experts begin briefing you. Interactive data charts invite you to explore trends and embedded documents beg you to dig deeper. This is how a newspaper ought to be. This feature article represents the future of journalism and the written word particularly in an era of touch-enabled devices. Today crafting features like NSA:Decoded is a huge task and completely unscalable. The writers and editors and engineers at the Guardian likely invested tens if not hundreds of hours to assemble it. The content creation tools and workflows prevent widescale content production of this quality. I hope video creation and editing tools content management tools and the data visualization tools will evolve to such an extent that articles like NSA: Decoded are the norm. I see signs that this is starting to happen but it’s early yet. YouTube’s video creator ecosystem is pushing the boundaries of scalable video creation. Next generation enterprise content management systems must evolve though I don’t know many new entrants in that sector. And the data visualization capabilities of D3 Google Fusion Tables and Vega among many others need to be simplified and integrated into content creation workflows. I hope the team at the Guardian writes about the process they used to create their investigative journalism epic and that entrepreneurs take up the challenge to create the software to enable these rich magical experiences to be published daily.

http://tomtunguz.com/engagement-is-the-foundation-of-growth/,Culture is the biggest growth driver for social services,Culture is the biggest growth driver for social services Every social service aims to achieve massive growth and deep engagement. But if forced to choose just one of these attributes I would pick engagement every time. An active user base implies product/user fit for a social service. Aside from the core functionality of social services which is a solved problem (profiles messaging feed) the essence of a social startup is culture - the values of the community the mores the manners of interaction. The right culture attracts users encourages participation and drives growth. For proof look at Reddit’s growth to 2B page views and the clear values they promote for their community. The same is true for Pinterest. Did you know Pinterest has Pin Etiquette? Successful online cultures replicate the behaviors of offline groups (from political groups to book clubs) which communicate a clear purpose for organizing members defined norms for interacting and effective tools for solving their members' needs and wants. So how does a social service become massive? The key is focusing on culture to drive engagement at the very beginning. I’ve drawn my take on the path using this engagement/growth 2x2 matrix to describe the path from the Ghost Town to the Rave. 4 - The Ghost Town: low engagement low growth Obviously the most challenging (and most common) place to be startup in this situation can focus either on fast growth (which would lead to the Leaky Bucket) or driving engagement (the Garden Party). 3 - The Leaky Bucket: low engagement high growth The challenge with focusing on fast growth without engagement is that it doesn’t build or reinforce culture. Users are brand new and don’t know how to contribute to the community. Plus it’s hard to understand what will improve the product when churning through large volumes of unengaged users. 2 - The Garden Party - High engagement low growth The culture of the social service has been set the product meets the needs of a small group of people and the party is “polite”. Now it’s time to garner more users while keeping the same values. 1 - The Rave: high engagement high growth Lots of people have arrived they know why they came and what the party is about so they’re having a great time. I believe engagement is the foundation of growth. And because culture cannot be tacked on the engagement problem can’t be solved through growth alone. Instead culture has to be inculcated into a community over time. Published 2012-10-18,Published 2012-10-18
http://tomtunguz.com/marketing-and-sales-harmony/,The Marketing Math Behind Scaling a SaaS Salesforce,The Marketing Math Behind Scaling a SaaS Salesforce A terrific SaaS VP of Marketing once told me “If the sales team is focused on hitting this quarter’s revenue target then the marketing team ought to be focused on next quarter and the following quarter.” In SaaS companies one of the marketing department’s primary responsibilities is generating sufficient customer interest to enable the company to achieve their revenue targets. If that’s the case determining how and when to scale a sales team in a SaaS company is contingent upon the marketing team’s metrics. It would be a mistake to hire a swath of salespeople assign them quotas and then fail to provide them with enough inbound lead flow to succeed. In that case marketing would be the limiting factor in the business. Of course some startups ask their salesforces to generate their own leads. But after reading Aaron Ross’s Predictable Revenue and seeing the process implemented in several SaaS companies I believe asking salespeople to generate leads in addition to closing them is be suboptimal in most cases Most SaaS startups hire a salesperson or two before hiring a marketing team. During the initial phases of discovering the sales pitch and refining the process this sequence makes sense. But as a SaaS company scales the company must begin to mechanize the sales process. A sales process is mechanized when the company has a high degree of confidence in the marginal revenue contribution of the new salesperson before hiring him/her. And the prerequisite to sales mechanization is consistently generating a pipeline large enough to feed the sales team. How big of a pipeline is necessary? The table below sketches out the math for a typical inside sales rep. Parameter Value Inside Sales Quota ($k) 350 Average Selling Price ($k) 10 Sales per Year 35 Lead-to-Close Success Rate 20% Total Leads Required per ISR 175 Marketing Lead Contribution 50% MQLs per Inside Salesperson per Year 88 MQL Sales Pipeline per ISR per Month ($k) 73 Inside Sales Quota - Quota varies from about $250000 to $750000 depending on the product the sector and many other variables. Average Selling Price - Also called revenue per customer this the average amount a customer pays to use the product. There is a large large variance by company and by sector but 50% of products fall within $5-$100k across the basket of public SaaS companies I track. Sales per Year - This a division of the quota by the ASP and is the number of sales at the ASP a salesperson must close to achieve quota. Lead-to-Close Success Rate - This is a measure of how effective the sales team is at closing leads and also a metric of how well qualified the leads are before they reach the sales team. Total Leads Required per ISR - Given the ISR’s quota and the close rate this figure is an estimate of the total volume of leads a salesperson requires in a year to achieve quota and close the target number of sales per year. Marketing Lead Contribution - As the Bizo and Oracle research shows marketing contributes about 20-60% of leads. The remainder are generate by the sales teams’ outbound efforts. I’ve taken the midpoint of the survey estimates for this calculation. MQLs per Inside Salesperson per Year - Given the marketing contribution this is the gross lead count for each salesperson to achieve quota. MQL Sales Pipeline per ISR per Month - The total value of the leads marketing will generate in a month according to this plan. For this hypothetical example using approximate data the marketing team must generate about $900k in pipeline per year per inside salesperson to hit plan. Before investing heavily in growing a sales team SaaS companies should understand if the marketing team can generate sufficient leads to feed the sales team’s pipeline which is the key to salesforce mechanization and repeatable growth.

http://tomtunguz.com/excellence/,Every Damn Day,Every Damn Day “Blades square” the coach yelled from the Boston Whaler as he increased the speed on his outboard motor pursuing the eight man boat as we gained speed. I sat in four-seat right in the middle of the engine room the place for the taller heavier rowers. The eight man team reluctantly complied with the coach’s order and rowed across the Long Island Sound NYAC jerseys on our backs and the muggy humid early summer morning sun reflecting in the water practicing for national championships. Most of the time oarsmen feather their oars - rotating the blades to be parallel to the water as they move through the air helping the boat run on an even keel. Holding the blades square decreases the margin for error from a few inches to a few quarters of an inch. If anyone in the boat splashes their oar in the water the delicate balance of the boat is upset teammates grumble and the boat slows dramatically. In college we rowed blades square only infrequently. It was a difficult technique drill. At NYAC blades square was the norm. The coach demanded blades square all the time. Before races after races at 5am when we pushed off the dock to start practice and and 8am when we returned dog-tired. The blades square mentality pervaded the rest of our practices. Coach held us to standards higher than we expected to hold ourselves. Because he demanded blades square we demanded it from ourselves. And it became a matter of pride. I’ll never forget those first days rowing blades square my knuckles bloodied from hitting the gunwales each time an oar touched the water and the boat balance collapsed to one side. Nor will I forget the rest of the summer when blades square became routine and eventually second nature. Or the weight silver medal hanging around my neck as I stood on the podium. One of the entrepreneurs I’m lucky enough to work with has an expression for this idea that I love: “every damn day.” It’s the battle cry for 2013 for his company. It’s a refrain for excellence day in day out through the dark cold winter and the lazy dog days of summer. Whatever you call it rowing blades square or every damn day the idea is the same. Leaders have to demand excellence from their teams and drive teams to expect excellence from themselves. Every damn day. Published 2013-02-25,Published 2013-02-25
http://tomtunguz.com/learning-to-negotiate/,Startup Best Practices #11 - Practice Negotiations Before the Meeting,Startup Best Practices #11 - Practice Negotiations Before the Meeting My first major negotiation was a potential advertising agreement between Google and Facebook. I was PM on the social advertising team at the time. There was a call scheduled at 2pm one afternoon and I had been told that morning about it. I’m wasn’t an experienced negotiator so I panicked. I didn’t know how these conversations worked. I called some a few other product managers I knew inside Google and asked their advice. I downloaded a few eBooks on negotiation and took notes. When 2pm came I dialed into the call. I’m sure the Facebook team could hear my ragged nerves over the phone. I realized a few minutes into the conversation that these 60 minutes were the first step of many. We chatted on the phone became acquainted and sketched the outlines of a partnership that might make sense. Ultimately and for many different reasons Facebook chose Microsoft as their advertising partner. Since that frenetic morning almost a decade ago I’ve been trying to learn as much as I can about negotiation. There are a multitude of approaches: the theoretical zone of possible alternatives and best alternative to negotiated agreement; hard counter offers & brinksmanship; maximizing leverage; wearing people down; never conceding always trading. Each of these frameworks provides a negotiator a way of ensuring they win the points that are important to their startup trading less important elements away and to ensure the partnership is mutually beneficial. After I understood the tenets of these frameworks the most difficult part for me to understand became the mentality of the best negotiators. Take for example this self-diagnostic question from Everything is Negotiable: True or False: Faced with a difficult opponent in a negotiation it is better to concede something of little value in order to create goodwill. This question gets to the heart of the negotiator’s state of mind. Most people say true (I did). But that’s not the right answer. In fact the question is structured to create a defensive posture in the reader. Look at the diction: stronger opponent (there are no opponents in negotiation); concede (never concede only trade); etc. Because negotiation happens between two people the personalities of the individuals and the chemistry between them will define the way the negotiations unfold. Frameworks for thinking through negotiation are helpful. But ultimately practice forges the best negotiators. I’ve been told that the very best corporate M&A teams repeatedly practice their negotiation sessions among themselves playing both sides of the table before the real thing. Founders negotiate every day. Financings job offers real estate leases software contracts promotions. Everything is a negotiation. Improving negotiation skills is a powerful way to improve a startup’s efficiency and ability to accomplish key goals on the right terms for the business. Make sure you invest the time to outline your goals research the frameworks for negotiation and take the time to practice before a big meeting. Published 2015-05-05,Published 2015-05-05
http://tomtunguz.com/upsell-ratios/,How Much Should Your Startup Spend on Customer Account Expansion?,How Much Should Your Startup Spend on Customer Account Expansion? It’s hard to overstate how powerful negative churn is for a SaaS company. Both New Relic and Zendesk have grown to billion-dollar-plus publicly traded businesses by achieving fantastic negative churn figures: 114% and 120% respectively. in other words each year existing customers pay these businesses 14 and 20% more than last year. The recent 2014 SaaS benchmark survey aggregated by Pacific Crest and Matrix indicates that expansion revenue accounts for between 8-26% of total annual bookings increasing as the company scales. There are many different ways of achieving this kind of account expansion. In some cases customers use more of a product over time and consequently increase their spend without help from a salesperson. In other cases startups rely on upsell teams to entice and encourage customers to increase their spend. Often these upselling teams operate within the customer success organizations structured as parallel sales organizations with quotas similar to the new customer sales team. In these types of sales teams how much should a startup spend on customer account expansion? Using data from the PacCrest survey I estimated the relative investment between new customer salespeople and upsells salespeople. At the very earliest stages of a company startups effectively staff five to seven salespeople to acquire new customers for every one salesperson hired to increase account size. In practical terms the smallest companies likely don’t have a full-time person but divide the time of a smaller sales team. As the company grows in size and revenue this proportion decreases to about 2.5 new customer sales people to 1 account expansion salesperson. The PacCrest survey presents some terrific data to support an investment in both customer success and a parallel upselling team. At scale these teams contribute upwards of 25% of annual bookings.

http://tomtunguz.com/your-startups-pricing-plan/,How To Price and Sell Your Startup’s Product,How To Price and Sell Your Startup’s Product Every SaaS business must decide how to charge for the service. Pricing plans are some of the most difficult decisions to make. Equally important to the price is determining the point at which the customer pays - the conversion point. There are four different models that I’ve experienced: up front payment freemium limited free trials money back guarantee. Picking the right one depends on a number of different factors. Below is a table that summarizes these four approaches. Pricing Model User Value Product Complexity End User Buys Avg Seat $ Freemium Increases with time Simple Yes or No Low Limited Free Trial Increases with time Complex Yes Low/Medium Up Front Payment Immediate Simple Yes High Money Back Guarantee Immediate Complex Yes High Freemium Freemium is a strategy for products whose value proposition is simply conveyed and whose value increases with time. Evernote’s value compounds with the data the user enters into the database. Expensify’s utility increases with the number of expense reporters on the system. Freemium businesses must target markets with very large user bases because the conversion to paid rates vary between 2 to 4%. To drive $50M in annual revenue at that conversion rate and $100/year subscription you would need 17M users. Sometimes the end users are buyers (typically in consumer services). Other times (for enterprise customers) end users are sales prequalifiiers who create a groundswell within an organization to convert to paid. Given enough users of a product in an organization the enterprise can be up sold to a company wide license. Freemium distribution enables a company to acquire those users inexpensively. Limited Free Trial The main difference between freemium and trial products is product complexity: trial products are more complex and need time for the user to gain a deeper understanding of the value. CRM tools like Salesforce and 37Signal’s HighRise both use limited trials. The goal with these marketing mechanisms is to drive customers to explore the product for a brief period of time and then force a conversion. Allow too much time to pass and the customer will forget the value proposition. These kinds of products tend to require significant user behavior change so these products must market a promise and then use the conversion to paid event to enforce that behavior change (carrot + stick). Because of the behavior change these products are marketed to decision makers who select the software for their teams: product managers tech leads and heads of sales. Many of the tests I’ve seen have indicated shorter trial periods are better: 7 days is better than 14 days is better than 30 days. Up Front Payment To pursue up front payment you need an established brand with a clear value proposition and you sell the product to the end-user. Adobe’s Creative Suite is a canonical example. Customers know what the software can do and if they need it customers will pay for it. The same is true for AutoCad MS Office and operating systems. Most of these products are high cost per seat products. Because they are well-known in the market they command a price premium. Money Back Guarantee For products lacking an established brand but offering an immediate value proposition and charging a high average seat value there is no better solution than the money back guarantee. It mitigates the customers commitment phobia but establishes a billing relationship at the outset. This pricing strategy requires contact with a sales or account management team which implies a higher cost of sales. Ideally higher conversion rates mitigate these costs. In other words the up front commitment is a sales pre-qualifier. Your sales team will have fewer higher quality leads. Plus your sales team will have direct product feedback to share with the product team. Oracle offers this for many of their products as do Eloqua. While each product and target market have some unique attributes consider the time to value complexity of the product product complexity and your sales model (freemium vs sales) when you do price your startup’s product.

http://tomtunguz.com/ad-tech/,You Shouldn’t Start an Ad Tech Company But If You Do…,You Shouldn’t Start an Ad Tech Company But If You Do… I started working in ad tech in 2005 and during the past eight years the ad tech ecosystem has progressively become more sophisticated competitive and oligopolistic. It’s hard to innovate in ad tech. But if you’re looking to start a company in the sector you’ll need to amass proprietary data or develop a market place with unassailable liquidity to vie successfully in the market. A Mental Model for the Ad Ecosystem The structure of the ad ecosystem greatly simplified looks like the image above. On the left the advertiser supplies dollars that flow to the right. The DSP (demand side platform) uses algorithms to inform an advertiser’s media purchases; i.e. which websites and mobile apps will perform best. The advertiser and DSP purchase media on the ad exchange which is an electronic market place where advertisers can buy media algorithmically and in real time on Real Time Bidding platforms. On the other side of the exchange the publisher uses supply-side platforms to find the best paying advertisers to buy their ad inventory. There are hundreds of SSPs and DSPs thousands of advertisers millions of publishers but only a handful of exchanges: Google’s DoubleClick Facebook’s FBX Yahoo’s RightMedia MoPub Adap.tv and a few others. These exchanges like most market places exert huge network effects because advertisers are attracted to the exchanges with the most inventory selection/liquidity. The exchanges see every transaction and have unparalleled visibility and data access into their respective ecosystems. Data data everywhere If there’s one defining characteristic of online advertising it’s data. Advertisers buy data and license algorithms to find better inventory. Publishers sell their data and license other algorithms to find better advertisers. In order to compete in an ecosystem of data a startup has to bring one of three advantages to market: better algorithms to use on the same data as everyone else better data than anyone else or a market place with the largest volume of ad inventory in a segment. Better algorithms is the fastest way of getting into the market as a startup. Similar to starting a new quant hedge fund you develop a novel trading strategy that works and sell it to customers. But competition in ad-tech is just like the financial markets - as soon as others see your strategy working they are likely to copy it. Over time the marginal advantages of better algos erode. Unless a startup continues to invest heavily in algorithm improvement it will forever be in a cat-and-mouse game. Better data: Where algorithms can be conquered proprietary data is unassailable. With access to richer ad performance data more detailed user data more granular conversion funnels your startup has created a significant barrier to entry. Better data means better results. And if you’re the only game in town then you’ll attract big advertising budgets. Getting access to better data is very challenging. It means finding and partnering with publishers and/or advertisers on an exclusive basis for some period of time then leveraging that data to build a successful DSP/SSP/ad network. Market places in ad tech as in the rest of the tech industry are beautiful things. They are natural monopolies capital efficient and are strategically valuable. Building a new ad tech market place is the most challenging way of entering the market because of the strategic role these products play in the ecosystem. The most successful startup market places (RightMedia Adap.tv BlueKai MoPub) each took advantage of a discontinuity in the market place (inventory glut video ads rich user data mobile ads) to develop a foothold in the market faster than the incumbents. Over a few years each of these companies built liquidity into their market places and now are the leaders in their segments. The Recipes for Success As the ad tech ecosystem has bloomed competition has increased dramatically. To best position your new ad tech startup for success and develop a long term advantage you need to develop leverage by developing proprietary data sources or by creating a market place based on some technology discontinuity. In other words bring something to market that no one else has and that is difficult to copy. Published 2013-05-20,Published 2013-05-20
http://tomtunguz.com/favorite-devices-2014/,My 2 Favorite Gadgets from 2014,My 2 Favorite Gadgets from 2014 These are my two favorite devices from 2014. I use each one on a daily basis and both have changed my life in a meaningful way. Amazon Kindle In 2014 I slept really poorly. I had trouble falling asleep and when I did I had chaotic dreams and I was tired when I woke. I thought it was stress. But it turned out to be my Nexus 7 tablet. Before going to sleep I read for 45 minutes or so each night. Flipboard New Yorker newspapers emails and the Kindle App on Android - this was my routine. In December I bought a Kindle and everything changed. I knew about the impact of electronics late at night on melatonin the hormone which controls sleep. When humans see blue light their bodies suppress melatonin keeping them awake. I had installed f.lux on my Mac an app which reduces reduce blue light from my laptop through the day. It seemed to make some difference particularly when I was working late. But the Kindle’s effect on my sleep has been dramatic. I sleep much better much more deeply and more consistently. The Kindle has been nothing short of a life-changer. Moto Hint I spend a lot of time on the telephone. Some months it’s more than 60 hours - board meetings startup pitches customer and team references and internal meetings. I had been using the Sennheiser earphones Marco Arment recommended for a few years and occasionally a Jawbone Era. Both are bulky in their own way and I can’t wear either one comfortably for extended periods of time. But then I tried out the Moto Hint after seeing a review on the Verge (and watching the movie “Her” and wanting to live a bit further into the future). The best thing about the Hint is the size. It’s so small and so lightweight that it’s easy to forget it’s in my ear even after a few hours on the phone which is a novel feeling. The sound quality is pretty good the noise cancellation is great and the fact that the case charges the Hint while in my pocket means it’s always ready to go. I don’t really use any of the advanced features. The size is the killer feature for me. The Kindle and the Hint are my two favorite devices from 2014. What are yours? Tell me on Twitter.

http://tomtunguz.com/goal-setting/,The Best Goal Setting Frameworks,The Best Goal Setting Frameworks Of late I’ve been having lots of conversations with founders about setting goals. It’s a really important topic for many founders because it’s the way that management teams align incentives and focus an organization on a few important areas. It’s their focus that enables startups to move quickly one of their key competitive advantages in the market. But what is the optimal way of setting goals? I first learned about goal setting at Google which employs the OKR (Objective and Key Result) that Andy Grove developed at Intel. He wrote about it in a book called High Output Management. At its core an OKR is a description of the goal with a quantitative metric of success. Angus Davis founder of Swipely added an important element to the way his company sets OKRs: each goal has to be aligned with the major goal of the business. Often this type of quarterly goal setting engenders fears of linear thinking and linear progression which is why many companies encourage their employees to aim to achieve only about 70% of their goals and many managers at Google demand that their employees each quarter create a moonshot goal. The likelihood of success of this aspiration is quite low but if successful it can meaningfully alter the trajectory of the company. But there are other frameworks for setting goals. I was chatting with a head of human resources at a fast-growing startup and he described three different kinds of goals: absolute goals relative goals and sustainment goals. Absolute goals are things like revenue users employees – numbers that in a fast-growing company are monotonically increasing. Relative goals are things like market share or app rankings. Startup can aim to be in the top 10 mobile apps in a category for example. Sustainment goals are things like 99.999% uptime or 90% customer satisfaction. This executive favored a mix across the three for every individual because it can be challenging to be motivated exclusively by sustainment goals for example. Reading through some organizational behavior research I came across another way of thinking about goals. Elliott and McGregor two researchers known in the field categorize goals in three different buckets. Mastery performance approach and performance avoidance. Mastery goals are things like becoming fluent in Spanish or in Ruby. They are unique in that the measurement of success is intrinsic it is up to the individual to compete with themselves to achieve maximum success. Performance approach goals are the most common. Close $1 million new business this year. Generate 1000 new leads this month. Hire six more engineers. Performance approach goals require extrinsic validation in the form of compensation or bonuses or similar. They work well. The last category according to behavioral research is performance avoidance goals which asks people to demonstrate that they are not incompetent. Studies of repeatedly shown that these are detrimental and ineffective. And then there is a host of research on the negative aspects of goals. This Harvard paper outlines all the pitfalls of goal setting: narrow mindedness learning inhibition and calibration among others. For example the Pinto Ford’s disastrous compact car of the 70s was a byproduct of focusing on shipping fast and not paying attention to safety. I had wanted to find some consistent framework for setting goals. But like pricing there doesn’t seem to be an optimal mechanism of goal setting. The research is still all over the place and different companies employ different techniques to achieve great success. Ultimately logic and clear thinking are probably the best tools for setting goals and motivating an organization properly. Published 2015-07-21,Published 2015-07-21
http://tomtunguz.com/bill-macaitis-talk/,The 9 Marketing Disciplines of Great SaaS Companies,The 9 Marketing Disciplines of Great SaaS Companies Bill Macaitis the former CMO of Zendesk articulates how a SaaS marketing team should operate better than anybody else I’ve met. At a recent Point9 conference Bill outlined the 9 marketing disciplines of great SaaS companies and how they fit together to create a marketing powerhouse. I’ve copied my notes from Bill’s talk below. Ops & Analytics Team The operations and analytics teams is the first marketing team every SaaS company should build because this team erects the experimental infrastructure for determining which marketing tactics are viable. Over time it also becomes the largest team. Zendesk employed a combination of products to build this infrastructure including Convertro Google Analytics Infer Optimizely and DemandBase. This team employed sophisticated attribution models to understand precisely how many impressions and the types of impressions were required to catalyze a conversion to paid event. In addition to managing the experiments of performance marketing the Ops and Analytics team measures qualitative metrics like net promoter score aided and unaided recall and sentiment analysis of the brand. These qualitative analyses provided Zendesk insight into the top five reasons users recommended product and the top five reasons users didn’t convert to customers informative data for adjusting marketing tactics and guiding the product roadmap. Customer Evangelism Zendesk’s strong brand enabled its efficient growth. Bill’s team built the brand by investing in long term initiatives like customer evangelism and content. Bill tasked the customer evangelism team with three goals. First to identify evangelists; second to nurture relationships with them; and third to leverage their enthusiasm for the product to drive awareness and ultimate conversions. For example this team would mine the results of the net promoter score surveys for people who self identified as evangelists. The customer evangelism team would build a relationship with them and eventually ask them to write reviews speak or for customers on the company’s behalf creating a huge library of positive reviews all over the web. Content Bill frames the value of the brand incredibly well. In his words “A brand is the sum total of all interactions a customer has with the company. I never want a customer’s first interaction with a product to feel like visiting a used car salesman. In SaaS that means the first visit is the pricing page.” To ensure this didn’t happen Bill and his content team devised a content marketing strategy that mimicked the buying process of their target customer. The team created content (text audio and video) for the top middle and bottom of the funnel. Top of the funnel content focuses on industry questions like the Top 5 Trends in Customer Support or the Top 10 Interview Questions for Support Teams. Top of the funnel content identifies Zendesk as a helpful resource in the ecosystem to future customers. Middle of the funnel content introduces the company and some of the key value propositions that solve tactical challenges for customers. Bottom of the funnel content focused on a specific features in the product that would trigger a conversion to paid event. Creating content at scale is challenging. So much of the inspiration for the content came from interviews with different team members within the company. In addition content is the second largest marketing team at Zendesk. Paid The third largest team is paid acquisition. Many SaaS companies equate paid acquisition to marketing. In Bill’n view this is short-sighted. Paid is just one part of the nine disciplines of marketing. Zendesk used paid acquisition to target and saturate a particular vertical geography customer segment or company. The Ops and Analytics teams’ infrastructure enabled the company to quickly determine which channels worked to drive leads and which built brand equity. Zendesk used video frequently because it was less competitive than SEO/SEM. They also advertised on the search “Zendesk alternatives” by creating a fictitious alt rock band called Zendesk Alternative. The video went viral further bolstering the brand. Website/Conversion Team Known better as growth hacking the Website/Conversion team is a group of front-end and back-end engineers optimizing the various funnels potential users may go through by creating referral programs testing new designs on the website and experimenting with incentives. Product Marketing Zendesk’s product marketing team focuses on understanding customer needs segmenting the market and developing pricing plans to meet their needs. When Zendesk moved into the enterprise the company tested substantially higher price points. Like other Veblen Goods Zendesk’s product increased in demand as the team increased the price point. The higher price conferred a greater perception of value and quality to enterprise customers accustomed to paying large amounts for software. Lifecycle Nuturing The typical enterprise customer will have 10-30 interactions with a company before buying software. And because of upsell and cross-sell after the sale more than half of the customer’s revenue potential occurs after the customer starts to pay. The lifecycle team strengthens the companys’ relationship with the customer throughout this lifecycle. Zendesk marketed to existing customers most effectively by building an internal messaging platform within their product that allowed very granular targeting and segmentation of their users. For example if a user checks the reports tab frequently and a new advanced reporting feature were released they might receive free access for 30 days to the advanced reports. Comms The marketing communications team is a PR team managing the brand strategy brand narrative and the public relations of the company. International Zendesk structured their international team differently than most companies. They hired native speakers of their target countries to work at headquarters in San Francisco. Keeping these marketers at HQ enabled them to stay connected to the company and feel empowered rather than isolated. The field marketing teams complemented the HQ-based marketing teams. But these field marketing teams focused more on user activation sales enablement and training rather than feature announcements and content. – Bill has built marketing teams at four very successful companies. It’s plain to see why. He has mastered the structure organization and management of large scale marketing teams that balance performance advertising and brand building top and bottom of the funnel product marketing and growth hacking.

http://tomtunguz.com/the-dumbest-guy-in-the-room/,The dumbest guy in the room,The dumbest guy in the room I rowed crew in college. I walked on to the team and fell in love with the sport the very first time we pushed the boat from the dock and took a stroke. Looking back on those four years I often draw parallels between rowing and entrepreneurship. My freshman year Joe Holland who had raced for the national team in the eighties had taken a sabbatical to coach the freshmen team. He was a master and he loved the philosophy of rowing as much as the sport. When I asked him how he became such a great athlete he said “I made sure I was always the slowest guy in the boat. I knew I could push myself much harder if I needed to keep up with the fastest guys.” Eight years later I started at Redpoint. One afternoon Tim Haley one of our partners told me the founding story of Netflix. Tim focused on one key component to the success of the company. From the very first days Reed Hastings had set about building a management team of experts in particular fields like operations (for managing DVD logistics) product management and marketing. When the management team gathered Reed wanted to be the dumbest guy in the room. In fact reading through Netflix’s culture slides you’ll find gems like: Imagine if everyone at Netflix is someone you respected and could learn from Adequate performance gets a generous severance package We are a pro-sports team: We have stars in every position competing for a fixed number of seats This management philosophy is fundamental to great teams both in sports and in business. By surrounding ourselves with people who are skilled in their fields each striving to be better challenging each other we can accomplish great things. Published 2012-12-05,Published 2012-12-05
http://tomtunguz.com/app-store-competition/,4 Major Competitive Trends in Mobile App Stores,4 Major Competitive Trends in Mobile App Stores More than 100B mobile applications have been downloaded since the launch of the Apple iOS and Google Play stores. As the number of users downloads and apps have exploded the dynamics of the app store have also changed. During the past 18 months the competitive behavior within the Free Apps section of these app stores has evolved substantially in four meaningful ways: First the Android Play store has become substantially more welcoming to startups/new entrants than 18 months ago. The chart above compares the competition in the Play store in early 2013 and in mid-2014. On the x-axis I’ve plotted plots the rank volatility[1] how much a typical app moves in ranking in 30 days on the x-axis. On the y-axis the chart shows the percent of applications that exhibit that volatility. I’m using rank volatility as a proxy for competitiveness: more changes in rankings in the app store implies more competition and a more efficient marketplace which should help the best apps rise to the top even if they are new to the app store. In 2013 apps most frequently moved only 1-2 slots meaning if an app became #1 it was very difficult to displace. In mid-2014 apps’ rank volatility is far more uniformly distributed meaning mobile apps are moving up and down all the time implying strong competition and a vibrant market. Second the iOS store has also become more competitive. In 2013 many apps controlled their rank and observed rank volatilties of less than five slots. Today the fraction of those controlling applications has fallen by 80%. However unlike the Play store which exhibits a relatively uniform distribution of rank volatility meaning a roughly equal numbe of apps move 3 slots and some move 75 slots apps in the iOS store tend not to see swings of 50 or more very frequently. Just like in 2013 today 75% of iOS apps see a volatility of less than 50. Third the typical app in 2014 swings 10-30 ranks per month compared to 1-5 ranks eighteen months ago. There’s much more jockeying for position. The counterpoint to a greater ease to reach the top 10 or top 50 is that it’s easier to fall as well. This data implies startups must be much more attentive to their app rankings. Staying at the peak of the charts demands more sophisticated organic and paid acquisition strategies but more importantly developing differentiated products. Fourth competition varies by category in both stores. The chart above shows the iOS store and the chart below the Play store with the volatility broken down by app category. The concentrated spike in Social Networking indicates very small app rank volatility (the top spots are hard to unseat). Contrast that shape with the statistical mesa of Weather. These differences aren’t surprising. Social Networks tend to create power laws with their user bases - the big become bigger - and this behavior is echoed in the charts. On the other hand Weather apps which rebroadcast the same weather data see much greater movements in app ranks as new and better products are released. The story with Google Play is similar below. During the past 18 months all the metrics for app stores have grown dramatically especially the number of users and the download counts. The size of the audience for mobile apps presents an even more compelling distribution opportunity for startups to acquire users. In addition the increasing efficiency of mobile app marketplaces means very few apps are unassailable. The successes of mobile-first social networks like Instagram and SnapChat despite Facebook’s dominant position in social networking are concrete examples of this trend. Because of the greater efficiency of these marketplaces the best apps will rapidly rise to the top and others will quickly fall out of favor. In short it’s a great time to be a mobile startup with a differentiated product. [1] I’m using the standard deviation of the ranks to create this volatility metric.

http://tomtunguz.com/when-should-i-start-a-company/,Is Now a Good Time to Start a Company?,Is Now a Good Time to Start a Company? The fundraising markets have infused more cash into startups in 2015 than in any year since 2001. But the venture backed IPO markets touched five year lows and whispers of a bubble have become a meme in the past six months. What’s really going on? And should that impact when founders start companies? No one can time the financial markets. If you can you should be trading stocks bonds and options and retiring very soon. The financial markets will rise and fall and shouldn’t factor heavily into when a founder decides to start a business. One founder I admire greatly left Google to start a business only after he saw the signs the public financial markets had soured. He rationalized he would have a much easier time recruiting the best talent. In addition the turbulence in the stock market would keep risk averse candidates from clogging his recruiting pipeline. Only people in love with an idea or with startups would take startup risk as Lehman imploded. When potential founders ask me the right time to start a company I remember his advice to me. The best time to start a company is when you have a unique perpective on a market you have developed a strong network of people who can form your founding team and you can convince a few of these friends that the idea is worth pursuing. These people form the kernel around which the company will crystallize. If you can’t hire a great team there’s a problem. The idea may not be well refined enough or bold enough. You may not yet be able to sell yourself or the vision well enough to convince someone to take the risk. You may not yet have developed your network of people passionate and skilled in your startup’s area. Investors will always chase great teams pursuing unique ideas. That is a constant despite the vacillations of the financial markets. The best time to start a company is when you can nucleate a team around yourself and your vision.

http://tomtunguz.com/holacracy/,Should Your Startup Adopt a New Management Style?,Should Your Startup Adopt a New Management Style? Earlier this week Zappos declared they will abandon traditional management structure for holacracy a management ethos that eschews pyramids and hierarchy in favor of self-organizing groups called holons. It’s not a structure without management but one of distributed authority and management. Below is a schematic describing holacracy at a high level. Holacracy has been adopted by a handful of other companies including David Allen’s company the blogging platform Medium and some non-profits. Valve and 37Signals also seem to have adopted some of these ideas too. But Zappos may be the biggest company to adopt this management style yet. I’m excited to see how the transition goes because Tony Hsieh’s success could start a broad management movement. The biggest challenge for executive teams is attracting retaining and maximizing the talent of their people. According to a McKinsey survey of 1k+ people conducted in 2009 the top three ways to motivate people are praise from a manager attention from leaders and opportunities to lead new projects. My understanding is that holacracy was developed in response to those problems. Holacracy should enable employees to create projects on-the-fly and assemble teams as needed. This should make employees more productive and happier. If it works as intended holacracy should also reduce the amount of time the company’s management team spends on decision-making and general administration of the business by pushing it to employees granting executives more time to spend with different groups. I’m reading and learning about holacratic management practices at holacracy.org. Some of the questions I have about it are: how does holacracy change the roles of the management team? How difficult it is to train employees in a new working style? Will the benefits of employee happiness ultimately materialize? I’m not certain this structure is right for every organization or even for which companies benefit most from it but it does seem like an important management prototype worth digging into.

He is a brilliant marketer and created the notion of the three doors to SaaS success. He spoke about this innovation at a recent CMO summit; the video is here. If you visit Zuora’s website you’ll see Zuora’s three doors along the top of the page: Subscription Economy Why Zuora & How It Works. Those are the three most important navigation links on the page. Each door answers one key question for prospective customers. The Subscription Economy page describes the Market. In particular what changes in the market must customers respond to? It’s the hook to encourage visitors to read more. The second door is the gateway to the Value Proposition. Zuora puts it very directly Why Zuora? Each element on the page describes the benefit of the product both in the company’s and in customers words. The value proposition is laid out for different industries and key roles in the purchasing process. The last door How It Works describes the product at a high level. It answers the question of how Zuora completes its value proposition promise. Most importantly the third door tees up the next step contacting the Zuora sales team. Tien Tzuo’s three doors is a simple framework for creating SaaS websites that tell customers a story of why they ought to use a product. It’s concise and elegant and a simple way to organize content for SaaS companies.

http://tomtunguz.com/sales-indicators-lagging-and-leading/,Why Quotas Aren't the Most Important Number for Startup Sales Teams,Why Quotas Aren't the Most Important Number for Startup Sales Teams I’ll never forget the first time I was assigned a sales quota. I was six months into a sales role at Google in which I on-boarded and managed the accounts of social networks running AdSense ads. Our key metric was customer satisfaction and retention. After a few months I was starting to get into a groove. And then our team was assigned a new manager who put the team on a quota sending me into a tailspin. I was daunted by the quota. I asked myself if I might ever be able to hit the number and doubted that I could. I fell into a crisis of confidence. How would I add $X of additional revenue this year? I remembered my quota trauma while reading an article by Jason Jordan a sales management training consultant who wrote about the three kinds metrics that matter for sales teams: Business Results Sales Metrics and Sales Activities. Business Results are the revenue growth figures for a company at the highest level. Sales Objectives are the goals of each sales team: acquiring brand-name customers growing customer accounts or hitting a quota. Sales Activities are outbound sales calls writing account plans and qualifying leads. Jordan makes a great point in his post that the only type of metric sales teams can effect are the tactical Sales Activities. Unfortunately most sales teams only measure Sales Metrics so it’s challenging to diagnose why salespeople miss quota. He argues sales managers should focus their sales teams on Sales Activities and measure those leading indicators in addition to Sales Metrics which are lagging indicators of success. In my interpretation that means sales managers ought to set a quota and in addition outline a general plan (total number of calls target sales sizes conversion rates) for how to accomplish that quota. This enables the sales team to understand how they are tracking towards the Sales Metrics and allows them to diagnose where the sales funnels might be under or over-performing. I’m sure the most successful sales teams have instrumented the Sales Activity metrics Jordan talks about because it’s a very logical thing to do: dig deeper into the sales process to understand how to improve it. But I wish I had read Jordan’s post all those years ago. Published 2014-01-13,Published 2014-01-13
http://tomtunguz.com/education-sales-vs-execution-sales/,Education sales vs execution sales,Education sales vs execution sales When going to market startups tend to pursue one of two sales strategies either education sales or execution sales.These sales strategies are substantially different. They demand different sales cycles pricing and market positioning - potentially even different team members. The Education Sale If your customers don’t know they need your product yet then the sales process is an education sale. Education sales are common when creating a new market (TiVo inventing the DVR) or when bringing existing technologies to new market segments (CRM for restaurants). Education sales demand great product marketing. The product’s value proposition must be encapsulated in one concrete succinct idea. How do you explain the value of a DVR to someone who has never used one? “Watch your favorite shows whenever you want” or “Skip all the ads.” Testing the effectiveness of marketing messages is essential. Education sales require longer sales cycles. It takes time to convince potential customers that they need the product. Customers ask questions about basic functionality. These conversations are often consultative with salespeople asking about problems and matching the strengths of the product to those needs - also called solutions selling. Additionally the main goal during education sales isn’t necessarily to optimize revenue but maximize initial customer success to win reference customers that drive additional business. The Execution Sale If your startup is entering an existing market and competing with a better value proposition (10x better faster cheaper) then the sales focus is execution. Execution sales require great sales marketing (product differentiation). Sales pitches are characterized by sophisticated customer questions since they have already been educated by the first-to-market vendors. Instead of objection handling conversations with customers focus on trade-offs. Many times these sales processes are bake-offs with several vendors competing for the same business. This contrast could be much better design (Sonos in audio equipment) or much lower cost (Pure Storage in flash storage) or better technology (TideMark in business intelligence). The main goal of execution sales is maximizing sales velocity market share and revenue. In other words revenue yield optimization. Which sales process when? To maximize the impact of your startup’s sales and marketing teams match the sales process to the market and customer base. Published 2012-12-04,Published 2012-12-04
http://tomtunguz.com/merger-stock-cash/,Should You Take Cash or Stock to Sell Your Startup?,Should You Take Cash or Stock to Sell Your Startup? In 2000 the majority of tech acquisitions were primarily stock. One company would buy another using its own shares instead of paying for the target business in cash. But since then there’s been a secular trend to cash deals. In 2014 90% of the tech M&A transactions consummated by companies and excluding private equity firms in the US with disclosed deal values were cash deals. As the cash balances of large tech incumbents balloons (Apple is at greater than $30B Google at more than $65B Microsoft has $95B etc) more and more M&A is primarily cash because cash is cheap and interest rates are low. The best return on capital then is acquisition or stock buy backs which hit a record high earlier this year. In gross terms the same story holds true. In 2014 companies spent $22.4B of cash to acquire compared to $864M in stock. Interestingly the median value of a cash transaction is 3x the size of a stock transaction at $150M compared to $50M. Typically cash transactions are better for founders. There’s no risk of the transaction value depreciating with the fluctuations of the stock market. And the data shows the prices are typically much higher although that’s probably more correlation than causation - more attractive companies demand better terms including higher prices and cash transactions. Because the cash balances of large tech incumbents continues to rise and because of the low interest rate environment we should continue to expect M&A to be completed primarily in cash.

The chart above shows the gross margin trends of public SaaS companies broken down by their ACV (average customer value). At or close to IPO the median company irrespective of price point operates at about 70% gross margin. But SaaS companies with ACVs of $50k or less record substantially better gross margins in their early days 1 to 4 years before IPO than startups with $100k+ ACVs. Unlike companies offering lower price point products SaaS companies selling $100k+ contracts often bundle professional services with software to customize the software and train the client’s users how to use it. Most professional services businesses are run at zero or negative gross margin. For example Workday operated their PS group at Hortonworks operates at -34% gross margin. Workday’s operates at 6% margin. These very low margins depress the business’ overall gross margin substantially particularly in the early days when professional services accounts for 50% or more of revenues. Next let’s look at the true profitability of SaaS companies by ACV. To do that we’ll examine the cash flow margin (how much of the revenues of the business become true profit). The median SaaS company operates at 7-10% free cash flow at at IPO. But the higher price point companies operate again at substantially lower cash flow margins because of professional services. As all these companies approach IPO their cash flow margins converge and become statistically indistinguishable. Despite the decline in price points catalyzed by the consumerization of IT startups are finding ways to develop efficient and profitable companies regardless.

http://tomtunguz.com/jony-ive/,Creating the Strangely Familiar,Creating the Strangely Familiar In The Shape of Things to Come the New Yorker profiles Sir Jony Ive the man they call Apple’s greatest product. Ive is iconic. His products have been sold 1.5 billion times. For all of his success Ive’s personality isn’t well known. Neither is his personal history. Or how he manages the Apple Design Lab. The New Yorker article reveals some of these three things. Here are some of my favorite quotes. On Ive’s first meetings with Jobs in 1997 Jobs visited the design studio and as Ive recalled it said “F**k you’ve not been very effective have you?” This was a partial compliment. Jobs could see that the studio’s work had value even if Ive could be faulted for not communicating its worth to the company. During the visit Ive said Jobs “became more and more confident and got really excited about our ability to work together.” That day according to Ive they started collaborating on what became the iMac. Soon afterward Apple launched its “Think Different” campaign and Ive took it as a reminder of the importance of “not being apologetic not defining a way of being in response to what Dell just did.” On managing the Apple Design Studio and the importance of brutal intellectual honesty Ive encourages candor. “We put the product ahead of anything else” he said. “Let’s say we’re talking about something that I’ve done that’s ugly and ill-proportioned—because believe you me I can pull some beauties out of the old hat… . It’s fine and we all do and sometimes we do it repeatedly and we have these seasons of doing it—” “I had one last week” Akana said. “Which one?” he asked. “The packaging thing” she said. “That’s true” Ive said laughing. “It was so bad.” A detail about his personality Ive flicked through a sketchbook giving me time to see that like Leonardo da Vinci he sometimes uses brown ink. On his design philosophy The goal Ive said was to create “the strangely familiar.” The profile also exposes quite a bit about the history of the Apple Watch and some of the design decisions which created the Digital Crown. For example do you know why the Digital Crown isn’t the crown centered vertically on the Apple Watch? And why is it closer to the screen than the back of the watch? Anyone passionate about design or creating a design-focused culture at a company should read the article because it exposes at least a bit about the dominant design culture at Apple a company which has masterfully combined design and marketing to become the largest technology company.

http://tomtunguz.com/q314-tech-ma/,The Four Key Trends of the Startup Acquisition Market,The Four Key Trends of the Startup Acquisition Market The startup acquisition market is poised to have its best year in nearly a decade. If acquirers maintain the same pace from the first nine months of the year through Q4 more than 450 venture-backed startups will have been acquired generating more than $25B in proceeds. Given this state of affairs it’s a good time to take stock of the major trends in the startup market. I’ve observed four: The total number of startup acquisitions has remained relatively constant over the past 14 years. But the amount of large disclosed startup acquisitions has decreased by about 25% in the past 14 years. Smaller acquisitions and acquihires have taken up the slack. The average size of disclosed startup acquisitions has increased 10% annually on an inflation adjusted basis. The startup M&A market correlates well with the Nasdaq with an R^2 of 0.54 Let’s dig a bit deeper into each one of them. As the chart above shows the total number of venture-backed acquisitions in red has exceeded the 14 year average (gray dashed line) every year since 2010. The past four years have been great liquidity years for startups. The blue line shows the number of disclosed value acquisition. In 2014 acquirers will reveal the price of their acquisition 30% of the time. These disclosed acquisitions are most often the very largest ones because accounting rules require disclosure of material acquisitions for publicly traded companies. The number of these presumably large disclosed transactions has decreased over time and has been below the 14 year average for the past three years. Said more concretely smaller non-disclosed acquisitions have doubled in popularity over the past 14 years. The bar chart above shows the fraction of startup acquisitions with undisclosed prices. This could be because tech companies have achieved such a huge scale that the material acquisitions ten years ago are no longer material today. Or it could be that major tech acquisitions cost much more today than they did a decade ago. The truth is probably a combination of the two. The average disclosed sale price in the same period has increased about 10% annually inflation adjusted[2] each year since 2002 substantiating the hypothesis that big acquisitions are fewer in number but command higher price points. The chart above shows the aggregate value of venture-backed startup M&A activity from 2000 through 2014[1] in orange using NVCA data. In 2000 M&A activity generated an astounding $92B in proceeds. 2014 will reach about $25B placing third behind the amounts set in 2000 $92B and 2007 $33B. I’ve overlaid the price of the Nasdaq Composite in gray. Not surprisingly the Nasdaq and venture-backed M&A shows strong correlation an R^2 value of 0.54. When tech stocks are booming cash is easy to raise in the public markets and share prices are high decreasing the costs of acquisition compared to bull markets when the cost of capital can be much higher. The M&A market is vibrant both at the high end of acquisitions and at the acquihire segment. Even better prices are increasing because valuations are tied to the public markets which has seen a terrific bull run over the past few years. There’s no question we’re in a terrific sellers market. [1] 2014 is estimated based on the first three quarters using straight-line extrapolation i.e. I multiplied the number by 4 ⁄3. [2] All the dollar figures are inflation adjusted.

http://tomtunguz.com/customer-success-compensation/,Startup Best Practices 12 - Customer Success Compensation,Startup Best Practices 12 - Customer Success Compensation Compensation structures are one of the most interesting questions facing customer success organizations in software startups. How should customer success leaders structure their team’s compensation in order to align the objectives of individual customer success managers with those of the larger business? At the Customer Success Summit Boaz Maor VP of Customer Success at Mashery presented his rubric for answering this question. I have copied his table below. Management Objective Examples Weight Product Adoption Consistency of feature usage the fraction of active seats 10% Program Expansion New use of other product features and services; new department using product 15% Value to Customer Is the customer measuring ROI from our product? How compelling is the ROI? 20% Relationship Weekly or monthly update calls with relationship owner; occasional calls with executive champion 15% Non-Monetary Value Customer willing to provide references and/or case study; customer sends referrals 20% Monetary Value Identify a number of leads for upsell contract renewal rate 20% At Mashery customer success managers are evaluated on five different objectives: product adoption program expansion value to customer/ROI strength of the relationship non-monetary value and monetary value. Each field has a corresponding weight used to calculate the ultimate bonus for the CSM. Like sales compensation plans customer success compensation plans should evolve to serve the business’s needs. Using a rubric like this Mashery’s management team could for example decide that in the next six months upsells of existing customers are the most important strategic priority. So Boaz might increase the weight of the Monetary Value component and in particular the identification of upsell leads. Additionally a structured compensation plan like the one used by Mashery clearly communicates the expectations to each individual customer success manager. So it can be a great management tool.

http://tomtunguz.com/concur-acquisition-in-context/,The Concur Acquisition in Context: A SaaS MegaExit,The Concur Acquisition in Context: A SaaS MegaExit Yesterday SAP announced it would acquire Concur for $8.3B the single largest SaaS acquisition in history in dollar terms. To put this acquisition in context I looked at six other public-to-public acquisitions where one publicly traded company acquired another. Because the acquired target is public much of their financial information is readily available. As the chart above shows the Enterprise Value/Trailing 12 Month Revenue (EV/TTM Rev) multiple SAP paid for Concur is tied for the highest among any public-to-public SaaS acquisitions. Transaction Price ($M) TTM Rev ($M) Growth Rate Gross Margin Year of Acquisition Enterprise Value EV/TTM Rev SAP/Concur 8300 546 32% 63% 2014 5988 11.0 Oracle/Eloqua 957 95.8 34% 72% 2012 864 9.0 Oracle/Taleo 1921 315 33% 67% 2012 1805 5.7 IBM/Kenexa 1397 333 25% 61% 2012 1332 4.0 SAP/Ariba 4607 517 27% 66% 2012 4390 8.5 Oracle/Responsys 1770 194 25% 53% 2013 1291 6.7 SAP/SuccessFactors 3764 328 59% 66% 2011 3599 11.0 Above I’ve copied a table that compares the key data points across acquisitions. Across these seven transactions Concur generated the most revenue. Concur’s gross margins of 63% are a bit below the median of 66% and their growth rate equals the median. It’s easier to explain SuccessFactor’s premium multiple because they recorded a 59% annual growth rate when they were acquired in 2011. But can we explain the pricing of these MegaExits for the rest of the sample? Below I’ve plotted two charts showing the relationship between a company’s growth rate and the TEV/TTM Rev Ratio at acquisition and the gross margin and the TEV/TTM Rev Ratio. In both cases the R^2 the measure of how strongly the variables are correlated are pretty weak. I tried to create a simple linear to model to predict the TEV/TTM Rev Multiple yields using these two variables in addition to revenue. But the model has no predictive power. In other words across this very small sample set the financial fundamentals of the business don’t really drive the multiples. Instead factors like brand management team strategic importance and competitive auction dynamics seem to be much more influential over the ultimate selling price than income statement and balance sheet. Each of these massive acquisitions is a huge strategic move for the acquiring company and therefore it’s viewed as a snowflake a one-of-a-kind-acquisition. I’m certain we will quite a bit more fireworks in the SaaS M&A market. I’m curious to see how acquirer’s thinking around purchase prices continues to evolve. But in almost every regard Concur’s sale to SAP is an exceptional event for the SaaS world. Published 2014-09-19,Published 2014-09-19
http://tomtunguz.com/consumerization-of-it-is-happening/?utm_content=buffer24f24&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer,The Sudden Shift in SaaS Product Pricing,The Sudden Shift in SaaS Product Pricing One of the most important forces in SaaS today is the Consumerization of IT. Instead of a centralized IT organization deciding which products to buy product managers and marketers and engineers and data scientists determine which products they think would serve them best and buy them directly often using a credit card. This movement is transformative and its impact is immediate. The chart above plots the median Average Revenue per Customer by Year of IPO for the 50 SaaS companies that have gone public in the past five years. The typical SaaS company going public in the last three years has a 77% smaller average revenue per customer than companies in 2010 – 2011. In the past four years two companies went public with average revenue per customer of less than $1000 (RNG WIX); and another four went public with less than $10000 typical customer sizes (ZEN HUBS FLTX NEWR). In contrast 2011 companies logged a median customer value of $96000. When these newer cohorts of companies have gone public they have roughly four times the number of customers paying one-fourth the price of their older brothers. Consumerization of IT is an incredibly powerful trend for SaaS startups for three reasons. First it exhorts startups to build better products which are easy to use and provide immediate value. Second this trend demands the the sales process evolve from an education sale to an execution sale from a push to a pull sales process where customer support and success meaningfully reduce cost of customer acquisition. Buyers educate themselves with online materials and through product trials (perhaps some contact with support) before ever contacting the sales team contrary to the traditional enterprise sales process where outbound sales dominates. Third consumerization of IT enables SaaS startups to acquire customers far more cost-effectively than in the past which means they need less capital to grow just as big. The Consumerization of IT trend isn’t going to reverse. Buyers prefer buying this way - it provides them more control and less financial exposure. There are no longer locked into large companywide contracts with particular vendors. In addition startups benefit by reducing their capital needs and creating faster more repeatable sales processes that often look more like B2C sales than B2B. The impact is dramatic and startups have no incentive to reverse course. Over the last three years consumerization of IT has made an enormous impact on SaaS startups. The first three IPO classes of companies benefiting from this trend have demonstrated billion dollar companies can be built using these techniques. And I’m certain over the next few years we will see many many more building businesses on larger numbers of smaller customers. Published 2015-01-05,Published 2015-01-05
